I blend that out, I blend it down, which is going to make just a little bit of a concave effect, to make you look a little bit more snatched, a little bit more thinner.

Man...Niacinamide is really in everything these days, isn\\'t it? I feel like it is like the new Hyaluronic Acid. Hyaluronic Acid was in absolutely everything and then we started to try like avoid it, because it\\'s in absolutely everything. And then some people can get like irritated from too much Hyaluronic Acid. I feel like the same thing is happening with Niacinamide. I feel like some people are definitely looking for Niacinamide-free products these days. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. For me, the biggest issue with this product was actually its packaging. This bottle leads me to believe that it is a Serum or Ampoule type product. But as you can see, it is actually like super duper watery. It is like super lightweight. It\\'s actually more like the MISSHA Essence. So, it actually confuses me to how much of the product I need to use and if I do need to use like a palmful of this product, like I would an Essence, I feel like it is not great value for money, because it is only a 50ml bottle. Versus the COSRX Galactomyces Essence, which I just recently started using, so I haven\\'t included it in this month\\'s \"Hits & Misses\". But that one is like 150 or 180ml. And the two main ingredients, the first two ingredients, are the exact same. It is way more affordable than this one. It is a way bigger bottle with the same ingredients. And it actually has more of a viscous texture, so it has a bit more of a slip. So, with that one, I know that I can use it more as a Toner or a Serum step. Whereas this one, with the bottle and the texture and everything I get so confused to like when in my routine that I should use it that I just end up not reaching for it. Hence, I did open it a while ago, but I had barely used it, because I just end up reaching for my bigger Essences like this. Unfortunately, it has been a \"Miss\" for me. I don\\'t actually think it is a bad product, but, especially for a skincare beginner, I feel like it is just confusing.',\n",

So you can get those benefits, without it being like overly hydrating on your skin. I actually did do this as well in Florida, because the water there is not quite as soft or nice as water in Melbourne. And I didn\\'t want to break out from the water, so I actually, after I washed my face, I would put someone on a cotton pad, swipe it off and then, since I do have a bit drier skin, I applied an extra amount in my palms and then patted it in.

And even when I last checked @cosme, it was still ranked as #1 in the category of sheet masks. So obviously the popularity is continuing. So, for me, this sheet mask is kind of like a more affordable multipack of the numbuzin No. 3 sheet mask. Cause that one\\'s individually wrapped, per mask. It\\'s kind of expensive. But this one, it has seven masks for 770 Japanese yen. With the current exchange rate, it\\'s about 85 US cents per mask. So, super, super affordable. The only thing is, you really can only get it in Japan at the moment. So this one is not something that I would use every single day, because it is quite rich in its essence, but something that I would use on special occasions or when I need that extra boost for my skin the next day. The masks are absolutely drenched in essence that contains Niacinamide, as well as four derivatives of Vitamin C. And it\\'s supposed to help with pore care, brightening, elasticity, and glow. And it definitely does give that instant glow after I\\'ve used it. Also, there is so much extra essence in this pouch. When my friend gave it to me she was like, \"After you\\'ve used up the sheet mask, there is so much Essence in there, so make sure you put your own sheet mask or cotton in there and you can get like an extra two masks out of it.\" I would definitely recommend it more to Normal and Drier skin types, since it is quite rich and it does contain some Essential Oils as well, just as an FYI.',\n",

I know blush  can take a while to get through even if you're  wearing it on a daily basis, it still could take  years to finish. But for the price that's pretty  disappointing. The powder is definitely smooth  and looks really good on the skin. There's also  a light floral scent. I really only smell it when  I'm picking up color on the brush.

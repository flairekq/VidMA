        "transcript_text": "There are so many new beauty releases\nhappening all the time,\nso we gathered some of\nthe most-hyped products\nto test for ourselves.\nI'm a lip-oil freak,\nso I was dying to try out\nthese NYX Fat Oil Lip Drips.\nI bought so many.\nThey have the huge doe-foot\napplicator that I love\nand a very subtle fruity scent.\nThis isn't a perfect dupe\nfor the Dior lip oil.\nThe formula is slightly thinner,\nand the brush doesn't pick up\nand apply the product as smoothly,\nbut these definitely have\nmore of a color payoff.\nI do think this is the best lip oil\nI've tried from the drugstore for sure.\nIt feels so comfortable\nand hydrating on the lips,\nand I love the range of colors they have.\nI haven't tried a powder\nfoundation in a minute.\nThis is the Maybelline Super Stay\nhybrid powder-foundation.\nI just used the little sponge\nthat came with the powder to apply it\nall over my already\nmoisturized and primed face.\nThis powder is meant to give\nmedium to full coverage.\nI feel like it's more full coverage,\nbut it doesn't look cakey to me.\nI didn't even use concealer with this\nbecause I felt like the\ncoverage it gave me was enough.\nI noticed that it did exaggerate\nthe dryness around my nose a bit,\nbut some setting spray helped\nit all melt into the skin\nand not look so dry.\nMy other products blended\non top of this just fine,\nand it feels super weightless on the skin,\nand I noticed that I wasn't as oily\nat the end of the day.\nAbout-face released these\nCherry Pick lip color butters,\nand I am in love with these.\nThis kind of lipstick formula\nis so popular right now,\nbut this one is 100% my favorite.\nThey apply like butter,\nas the name suggests.\nJust so creamy and moisturizing.\nIt feels like a slippy lip balm,\nbut you still get a\nreally nice color payoff,\nand they kind of smell like peaches to me,\nbut not in a gross, super-artificial way.\nI highly recommend these.\nThis is the Half Magic Cheek Fluff.\nI love that name because\nit describes this formula perfectly.\nIt's this supersoft,\nfluffy, putty-like blush\nthat is so buildable.\nI genuinely think this blush is foolproof.\nLike, you can't apply too much.\nI'm typically very\nheavy-handed with my makeup,\nbut this applied like\na soft flush of color.\nIt looks kind of blurring on the cheeks,\nwhich I really liked.\nIt also comes in this compostable\nand recyclable packaging,\nwhich is so great to see.\nWe have another transfer-proof\nlipstick to test out.\nThis is the Revlon ColorStay\nSuede Ink lipstick.\nThis really does feel\nlike suede on the lips.\nIt's a very soft and\ncomfortable matte finish\nthat doesn't feel drying at all.\nFor the most part\nthey had really good color payoff,\nexcept this brighter red-orange.\nThis one was actually pretty patchy,\nso just a warning in case\nyou were interested in\nthe brighter shades.\nI did a little kiss test on my hand,\nand they actually are transfer-proof.\nThis is my first time ever\ntrying Oden's Eye cosmetics.\nThey released these\nJewel Shine eyeshadows,\nand I had to test them out.\nIgnore that blue shade. It came damaged,\nbut I still wanted to swatch it anyway.\nThere are two formulas with these,\nthe multichromes and the shimmers.\nThe multichromes are more expensive.\nThese formulas are just so buttery smooth.\nThey have beautiful glitter in them\nthat doesn't feel chunky,\nand it doesn't give\nyou fallout everywhere.\nThey look so pretty\nand shifty on the eyes,\nand they have, like, a billion colors.\nIt was so hard to choose.\nI really enjoyed using these,\nand I want to try more Oden's\nEye products in the future.\nThis product caught my eye one day\nwhen I was just scrolling through Ulta.\nThis is the Pacifica Kind Glaze\nDewy Glow Layer face primer.\nThat name reeled me in,\nand I just had to try it.\nI was kind of expecting\nit to be clear and oily,\nbut it's more like a creamy,\nslightly pigmented gel.\nIt does add a really\nnatural glow to the skin.\nLike, it's not metallic-looking.\nI used my go-to foundation on top,\nand I think this is a really nice primer.\nMy foundation looked really smooth,\nand I could see that subtle\nglow peeking through.\n16 bucks is a lot for the drugstore,\nbut I really liked this.\nThis is the Sacheu\nBeauty lip liner Stay-N.\nIt's a peel-off lip liner\nthat leaves a stain behind.\nThis is so much like\nthat peel-off lipstick\nI tested a while back.\nYou have to leave this on for 20 minutes,\nwhich I thought was a little nuts.\nThat's so much time.\nThe first time I did it,\nthe stain was just kind of noticeable.\nI used the nude shade,\nbut it looked way more pink than nude.\nI did it again to see if I\ncould make it more pigmented,\nand it kind of worked.\nI could definitely see it more,\nbut I feel like it just looked patchy.\nI do have a pigmented lip line,\nso maybe that's why it's\nnot looking great on me.\nI feel like this is a good idea\nbut not a great execution.\nHaus Labs just released\nthis Color Fuse blush.\nThese colors are just delicious.\nI'm so in love with them.\nThe Haus Labs powder formulas\nare some of the best I've ever tried.\nThis literally just melts into the skin.\nIt looks so smooth on the cheeks,\nand you can build up\nthe color really easily.\nLike, you can make these look as vibrant\nas they look in the pan.\nThese are pricey,\nbut I think a talc-free\nformula this good is worth it.\nThis is the MAC lash dry\nshampoo mascara refresher,\nand it's supposed to soften\nyour existing mascara\nso your mascara is\nrefreshed but not clumpy.\nI don't know if that made any sense,\nbut let's talk about it.\nSo, the first time I tried it,\nI applied it over my mascara\nthat was a few hours old,\nand it wasn't softening\nthe mascara at all.\nThen I realized this can't be\nused over waterproof mascara.\nSo I tried it again\nover my regular mascara,\nand it worked so much better.\nThis is one of those\nproducts though that's, like,\nyeah, it works, but at the same time,\ndo I really need this? Probably not.\nDanessa Myricks released\nthese Yummy skin-blurring\nbalm powder flushed blushes.\nI think this is the same formula\nas the balm powder, just in blush form.\nThese are so pigmented,\nbut in the you-need-to-be-careful\nkind of way.\nApply too much, and you will regret it.\nMy preferred way to apply\nwas to warm some up on the back of my hand\nand slowly build it up with a brush\nso I have more control.\nThese are really smooth and blurring.\nThey have this kind of soft-matte finish\nthat looks really pretty.\nAlissa Ashley influenced me to buy\nthe Sephora Microsmooth\nface powder years ago,\nand I stopped using it for some reason,\nbut I don't know why,\nbecause this is an amazing product.\nIt is the smoothest, silkiest powder\nthat you can do so much with.\nIt's described as a powder foundation,\nbut you can also use this to set makeup,\nto bronze, or to highlight.\nI just used this as an\nall-over finishing powder,\nand it immediately gives\nyou this soft-focus finish.\nIt applies so beautifully\nwithout making your\nskin look cakey and dry.\nI am definitely obsessed\nwith this once again.\nThis is the KVD Good Apple full-coverage\ntransfer-proof serum foundation.\nI have to address this immediately:\nThis is, like, four shades\ntoo light for me, but we move.\nI still wanted to test the formula.\nThis has pretty full coverage,\nbut not to the point\nwhere it looks unnatural,\nif that makes sense.\nIt dried down very quickly\nand had a more matte finish\nthan I was expecting with\nthe word \"serum\" in the name.\nIt looked OK over my more textured areas.\nIt didn't look cakey,\nand it felt lightweight on my skin.\nIt's a very OK foundation.\nDidn't love it, didn't hate it,\nI just know that $42 is a lot for it.\nColourPop released these\nadorable highlighters\nthat I had to purchase because ... hearts.\nThese are more subtle\nthan I was expecting.\nI did have to build them up a bit,\nbut they didn't get chunky\nor too metallic-looking.\nThey build up really nicely.\nI was mostly excited to\ntry out this lavender one\nbecause I never wear color highlighter.\nThe purply color was pretty obvious,\nbut it actually looked so cute.\nThis is the Wet n Wild\n5-in-1 essence primer liquid.\nSo you shake this really well,\nthen apply it to the face.\nYou have to let it sit for a minute\nbefore you apply your makeup.\nI actually think this gave\nme a really nice base.\nMy skin looked a bit\nsmoother, it looked glowy,\nand it had a slight tackiness to it.\nI tend to like a tacky primer.\nAll of my makeup applied\nreally well on top of this,\nand I didn't get oilier than\nnormal throughout the day.\nThis has a lot of mixed reviews,\nbut I liked this primer.\nThese are the Charlotte Tilbury\nmatte beauty blush wands.\nPeople have been using her\nhighlighter wands as blush,\nbut this is the first actual blush wand.\nThese have amazing color payoff.\nA little goes a really long way,\nbut you want to move fast with these.\nThey do dry down a bit quickly.\nBut these are so pretty,\nand they blend out really\nwell over other products.\nI love these.\nAnother day, another\nglossy lipstick to try out.\nThis is the Flower Beauty\nplump up gloss stick.\nThe formula is thinner\nthan I was expecting,\njust based on other similar\nlip products I've tried.\nIt doesn't really plump much.\nYou just get a slight tingling feeling.\nThis feels so nice and\nhydrating on the lips,\nbut it's more like a lip\nbalm than a lip gloss.",

        "transcript_text": "[Music]\nflop of the month of February I let it be abused I used them use sometimes I liked sometimes I did\nn't like sometimes I liked then I didn't like anymore I admit that the more time I have the more I\ndon't have it anymore I test the products I'll tell you and sometimes well my latin is super here on the other hand when\nI like it I'm 10000% sure so that reassures me a little bit I admit that there are\nproducts when I put everything on my desk I said to myself is it going to be a top a flop a\nblop and then there are some where it's obvious so here we go my kiki I start and I I will make my\ndecision for certain products well there like that on the moment it does not wait any longer\nI start with the base the primeur from Max Factor the miracle premium what a great discovery\nthis thing low price yes it is miraculous I I tested with lots and lots of foundation foundations\nthat tend to really shine very quickly on my T-zone obviously I have\na little mixed but a T-zone that really annoys me so yeah this little primer low price\nnice discovery I recommend it [Music] the make-up is a super good on it it has to\ndo its primer job really well here's what else to say it's a TOP\nanti-aging when it's from Maybelline of course you see all the references appears\njust below a few years ago I tested a format like that from Maybelline\nanti- age so there well that's why I wanted to try again nice discovery I'll tell you then\nthis fly tip I found a little disgusting after a few\nuses so I took it off I cleaned it there it doesn't happen can't see because\nI reused it but then what did I have all the trouble in the world\nputting it back on so I thought to myself, well too bad I don't clean it anymore because\nis it dangerous here's how to shoot an almost new product so be careful if you\ntake it off it's hard to put it back on I liked it and the more it comes me I like it here so\nI don't know I for me for the moment I was really very very well gone frankly first\nweek of use I said to myself wow great really it blurs your under eye that should\nmark really not terrible it is not camouflaged but it is not marked it was pretty\nand then and then and then it comes and well I find that my soudeuil is not bowl well\nit dries up a little little so flute it becomes a block here is it\nwill become a flop I don't know but for the moment it becomes a block because I\nfind that well my under eye less and less pretty so here it is a bloc\nl'\u0153uf mineral compact square foundation from Sephora I made a lot of people laugh with\nthis little puff yes it's clean it's clean because I washed it and frankly\ndon't use this puff without the wash I'll tell you why because I didn't\nlike it at all I feel like it was really bad t abrasive on application then\nblack side it is for a rather more covering application for the white side it is something\na little bit more in transparency and frankly but it is the ball this phew there are\nonly the imbeciles who don't change their minds well listen it's confirmed I was Brutus with\nthis puff and then and then so I used this foundation and then it's quite stupid no it\ndidn't do with brushes it wasn't that the fact but it's not great it's less fine\nthan with the puff so after a few uses at wash this damn puff\nand when I used it but it changed there how can I tell you white side I I don't like the\nblack side but the white side is very soft it feels like touching baby's buttocks here\nand then when applied it's really super so don't hesitate it washes very well well and it's\nreally the ball now let's talk about the Fantin here then the color is a little dark\nyes okay I started to regain a little color in the sun so it suits me a little better\nthe complexion is very very pretty I think it's really that so with the white side so\nfor an application a light coverage it's really very pretty it's an agglo effect it's a\nsatin effect with it does not extinguish your routine c it's not bright it's not water but\nhere there is something in this thing and frankly against all odds I tell you now\nit's a TOP if one day I had been told that a mineral compact foundation I was going to say it's going to be\na top and well yes it's a top and frankly for the price don't get the best of it it's really very very\nnice it has a very good hold it blurs the skin well pores really tip top with powder or\nwithout powder zone T so frankly that and that it's indestructible and frankly\nI didn't use powder most of the time with this awesome foundation then the\nbronzer from Nabla that I was happy to find this brand in fact available\nand I can no longer open it yes necessarily if I open it upside down works less well I\nreally thought I had a slightly luminous bronzer when I swatched it I'm going\nto redo a little Swatch for you I said to myself yeah it's a little luminous thing and indeed when\nI pass it on my hand there is has a discreet slightly light effect but in fact a little light but\nbut on application well me I find it more light and frankly I would like to finally\nfind a fine luminous bronzer here it is so it is fine it doesn't give a damn it goes works\nwell it stays on well they do Michael but it's not a glowing bronzer on me that's what I'm\nwearing today it's pretty it's fine but if you want a glowing bronzer enough your\nway it's call the bronzing skin from Nabla if for the light go your way\nfor a very nice bronzer go for it it's a very nice product so for me it's not a\ntop because the product is not disgusting but it's not a top since I was expecting something\nbright so it's a block my is a beautiful product block following the double blush from\nLH cosmetics that these two pink colors look pretty and parmes a darker a lighter a lighter\na little pinker and a little brighter than the dark I prepared you from\nSwatch then the darkest one is luminous but a little less than the light pink it's\nreally very very pretty it applies really well it blends into the skin it doesn't mark\nimperfections you can have me I won't talk about it any longer why because it's a\nTOP go for it then I have no idea what the other colors are worth but in any case\nthis one is really topissime in the palette she has cosmetics the d\u00e9brique palette so\nyou know 2023 c it's the fashion for blue beautiful discovery that this palette is still the\nmake-up that I'm wearing today a little bit different during my discovery today\nI applied this pretty beige color in transition color which is really sublime I\napplied in the outer corner this perfect gray he knows it works superbly well I applied\nthe famous blue to the rest of my eyelid and then I brought\nthis color to the center of the eyelids applied with a brush I find that this color is on my finger tends to do\na little bit Hatchi I also tested the black I did a very little black eyelash flush\nso I spent hours applying a little bit also externally flush with the eyelashes and the\nrest I did it in blue here they are very very pretty colors no fall it works\nreally well if you want blue if you like the colors parma parma and blue goes\nsuperbly well a little sunny effect with I love this palette it's a TOP\nthe volume mascara from RER beauty so I shaped it for a trip to be able to\nchange it a little more often I really have color everywhere\nhere it is product on which I hesitate volume a small volume a little bit of length it's a\npretty farmhouse cara who removes makeup well but not so well you have to be careful you have the impression\nthat we have removed make-up well the next morning we have the impression of still having a little bit sometimes\nthe cardboard eyelashes so well you remove make-up a little bit but it's a cardboard effect but it\ndoes not keep the color if you want it there's a cardboard effect, it's weird, it has a nice\nhold, it lasts well, it removes make-up, so well, strangely, it doesn't damage it as it\nis applied, as it is applied [Music], that's what bothers me\nit's that the next day sometimes you still have style as if you had put on hairspray you\nsee what I mean when you put hairspray on your hair and you say\nwell it's a bit cardboard and well that's it is this effect there without the color so I don't know what\n's in it but well here it is so it sometimes lasts very very well all day\nso is it a TOP is it a flop doesn't do too much either [Music]\nit's between the block and the top there are others who do the j much better ob\nfor the same price finally that's what so it's a block here we are not going to dwell on it then\nI bought a trio of nude lipsticks at Beauty Bay so three colors you\nwill see them scrolling just below I'm going to tell you do the swatches so\nthere was a very light so on the hand it's really quite pretty\nthere it's the darkest one I'm going to put there\nand there it's the one I still wear today that you discovered during from one of my videos\nhere are the swatches so here it's the ribbon color that you saw me wearing\nduring my videos this month and it's the one I'm wearing the other two colors are not ugly\nbut on my lips this one really comes out brown but then brown brown and this one is\ntoo yellow it's not pretty there we'll say a pretty peach but then the peach color disappears there's\nmore than the yellow undertone that stands out on my lips and frankly it's not pretty so\nout of the trio there's only one that I like and that's the color laughed then the textures are nice\nit's a creamy grape lipstick with good staying power a nice pigmentation no need\nto come and rub and rub and rub one pass is enough to have a nice coverage it's nice\nproducts but there you go you buy a trio of nudes and in fact I'm only going to continue to wear this one\nso it's a shame anyway I could have tested the redness\nbeauty bed discover colors and here I am anyway guard 15 which looks particularly a\nlot like the pilotolk from Charlotte Tilbury here I went through my selection of my\nmake-up products for the month of February I hope you had a good time if so\ndon't forget don't give a little blue thumbs up it's more than fun if it's not\ndone yet don't wait subscribe it's a video every Friday say 6 p.m. in Paris activate\nthe little bell to be notified of all my notifications also join me on\nInstagram I put photos of the riles and everything that comes to hand and that I find nice\nand well I'm resting here I think I've said everything I haven't forgotten anything I'll tell you see you Friday",

        "transcript_text": "Hello folks.\nToday's video is about\nshowing you cheap alternatives to expensive products that, in my opinion,\nperform either similarly or even better.\nAnd I deliberately do not use the word\ndupe in this context, because I simply think that this term\nis used far too inflationarily.\nAnd because from my point of view, a great many products that\nare referred to as dupes have nothing in common with the original products.\nAt least from the point of view of a product developer and a person\nwho deals a lot with raw materials\nand ingredients and the formulation of products.\nI also recorded a podcast episode with my dear friend Isa on the subject\n.\nSo if you want to hear my thoughts\non this: I'll link you to the episode below in the info box.\nAnd if you explicitly want a video on this topic,\nthen you are very, very welcome to write it in the comments below.\nAnd then I can also use a few products\nthat are supposed to be dupes to show\nwhy they are not dupes from my point of view.\nI'll start with a skincare product.\nI definitely have a good mix of skincare and make-up here.\nAnd the first alternative product that I would like to show you\nis the Isana Pure cleansing foam, which costs a maximum of 3 \u20ac.\nWhereas the Kylie Skin Cleansing Foam is over $30.\nAnd I have to be honest with you guys, I do\nn't see that much of a difference between these two products or foam cleansers in general.\nOf course there are products from time to time that dry out the skin a bit more.\nBut as\nfar as how this category of products works, it's all very, very similar.\nYou have dissolved surfactants in the water, you have the pump mechanism\nand because of the pumping, the product comes out as a finished foam.\nOf course you have to see which product suits you better because, as I said, there are\nalso\ncleansing products that dry out the skin a bit more\ncompared to others.\nBut here I see absolutely no difference.\nAnd I also find Isana's much more pleasant\nbecause it's completely fragrance-free, while I\ndon't really like the scent of this Kylie Skin product.\nOkay, make up, make up make up!\nThis lip tint or\nlip stain from Dior costs around 42 \u20ac\nand I have to say that my friend gave it to me\nbecause he saw\nhow crazy I am about these lip tints and lip stains.\nI've also made it my mission to test all sorts of lip tints\nto find out which ones are the very best.\nAnd accordingly he just bought me this one from Dior which costs 42 EUR.\nAnd I was so hyped!\nI was just so happy that my boyfriend remembered\nthat I absolutely love lip tints\nthat I applied it immediately without checking the ingredients.\nAnd this stuff just completely burned my guts.\nThere's a chilli extract in there if I remember correctly,\nand of course it's irritating to the skin and I'm already\nsuper sensitive to irritation like that.\nAnd I was like, my goodness, what's going on here?\nAm I going to get an allergic reaction right away or what about this product?\nBecause based on the description, you couldn't tell at all\nthat there was any form of chili extract.\nOf course, I then\nlooked at the list of ingredients and immediately found out okay, that's the reason.\nThat's why my lip is so badly swollen.\nThat's why it burned so badly, that's why it hurt so badly.\nAnd the effect of this Lips Tint is just barely there.\nWell, it doesn't give off a lot of color, the texture\nis super pleasant, it's very thin, but I just don't like\nthe fact that it burned my entire lips off and that\nwasn't really apparent based on the descriptions.\nAnd for \u20ac42, that's doubly disappointing.\nAnd accordingly I have three or two alternative products for you here\n, which are a bit in the drugstore\narea.\nNamely these new Essence Kiss Hydrating Lip Tints.\nThey are super comfortable on the lips too.\nI have one of these on my lips today too.\nThey are very, very light, but have a subtle creamy texture.\nThey're not as thin as this one from Dior,\nbut they don't burn my lips off.\nThey are scented with ethyl vanillin.\nThat said, if you have a problem with them,\nthen these are definitely not for you.\nBut for less than 3 \u20ac they are really great.\nAnother possibility would definitely be these small lip\ntints or lip stains from elf cosmetics.\nThey are also rather creamy in texture,\nbut feel wonderfully comfortable on the lips and they dry well\n, so you can put a lip gloss on them without any problems.\nAnd here there are no problems at all.\nSo I don't notice anything.\nIt doesn't taste like anything, it doesn't smell\nlike anything either, as far as I know.\nYes, it doesn't have a specific smell either.\nTherefore, if you don't like the perfume here,\nthen definitely have a look at the lip stains by elf again.\nI have the feeling that Glow Recipe's products\nare heavily hyped because there\nare hardly any comparisons to other Asian products.\nBecause the contract manufacturer of these products is located in Korea.\nAnd I also know from my own experience\nthat Korean products simply bring a certain feeling with them.\nSo they are often very light,\nnice and gel-like, nice and watery, can be\nlayered on top of each other without any problems and are very, very pleasant and hardly noticeable on the skin.\nAnd I just think that the people who discover Glow Recipe\nthink that this\nis something super new, super innovative.\nBut this is relatively common in the Korean area.\nAnd I also love the texture of the Glow Recipe\nBanana Souffle Moisturizer Cream, super comfortable.\nWell it really does have this light,\nsuper watery feel to the skin after you rub it in.\nIt feels wonderfully elegant and pleasant on the skin,\nbut the product also costs a lot.\nIt looks nice, you can put it in the bathroom and present it.\nIt's just cute and it just smells like the fruit\nthat's advertised on the front of the pack, which is banana.\nAnd it looks a bit like that too.\nAlthough I can not confirm that this is a souffle texture.\nIt's just a gel-like creamy texture.\nThat's why I don't know exactly what they mean by this about Souffle.\nBut if you don't have the cash\nand just like the texture and how your skin feels,\nthen I can definitely recommend Pyunkang Yul's products to you.\nThere is this Moisture Cream from Pyunkang\nYul, only it is formulated in a relatively basic way.\nIt doesn't have as many extras as this cream, but the product\nis completely fragrance-free, unlike the one from Glow Recipe.\nIt smells very, very intensely of bananas.\nAnd it just feels almost identical: it's super gel,\nit's moisturizing and it's very light on the skin\nand you can easily layer other products on top of it.\nHowever, this is more of a basic product.\nIt has more of a moisturizing effect or\nrather a moisturizing effect.\nThere isn't much in it now, but the other cream from Pyunkang Yul\nthat just came out, so this newer one, the Moisturizing\nBarrier Cream, is also very, very similar\nto this cream here, although it also contains tiger grass is.\nI believe ingredients from tiger grass and ceramide NP and some\nother moisture-binding ingredients like different types of hyaluronic acid.\nI can't get it out of my head right now, but she just has a few more\nextras inside.\nBut is cheaper compared to this Moisture Cream from Glow Recipe.\nThat means if you just like the skin feeling\nand the texture, but don't like this perfume that much,\nthen you should definitely take a look at the moisturizers from Pyunkang Yul.\nWhile I feel like I'm\nbeing stalked the internet for what I'm about to say, I still have to say it.\nI don't like the Charlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin Foundation.\nI've tried it in a variety of ways,\nbut it just won't cooperate with my skin.\nIt always sits weird on my skin and it feels weird\nagainst my skin.\nI don't like that and I just don't feel like\nhaving\nto try different techniques that I personally don't like\nor that don't work that well for me personally, only to find out\nthat I still don't like this foundation and won't like it.\nOf course I still use it, especially\nwhen I'm just sitting in front of the camera and not doing much and I know\nI'll wash my face off afterwards, but other than that it's just\nnot a foundation\nthat I like to use on a daily basis because it is looks ugly on my skin.\nAn alternative that costs a lot less and that\nI use much, much more regularly, especially when I use foundation.\nAnd now I very, very rarely use foundation.\nAnd then I also want to have a foundation that I can rely on,\nthat I can tolerate and that also looks good on my skin.\nAnd that's where I love to use the Hypoallergenic\nLongwear Hydrating Balm Foundation.\nI take a pump of this, apply it to my face\nand have a light coverage exactly where I need it.\nIt doesn't sit strangely on my skin, I tolerate it wonderfully\nand it doesn't cost 42 \u20ac.\nI don't know what Charlotte Tilbury's is right now,\nbut this one is just under \u20ac10\nand I'm much more comfortable with it.\nAs I said, none of these are Dpes, but in terms of performance,\nthis foundation works better for me than Charlotte's.\nIt doesn't have the same ingredients,\nit doesn't feel the same in terms of texture either\n, but for me personally it simply performs much better.\nAnd if you also have dry skin, like me\nand don't want to spend so much money\non a foundation, and above all if you\nfind a shade in the Hypoallergenic range that suits you,\nthen you should definitely try this foundation .\nThe thing with the shades, i.e. the shade range of this foundation, is really,\nreally bad.\nSo it's really terrible.\nAnd I really wish Hypoallergenic would adjust that because\nit's very, very difficult to find a color\nthat suits your skin, whereas Charlotte Tilbury\njust has a much, much bigger selection.\nAnd that is one of the reasons why I would definitely not say\nthat this is a copy or a dupe of this foundation,\nbecause the selection is completely different.\nSo what we\nfind in Charlotte Tilbury in terms of nuances, you will definitely not find in Hypoallergenic.\nAnd as I said, the ingredients, the texture,\netc., are not similar.\nBut for less than 10 \u20ac I\njust use this foundation much, much better compared to Charlotte Tilbury.\nNow we have arrived at one of the most difficult topics: concealer.\nWhat concealers I tried out during my extreme make-up phase,\nbecause everyone said that this and that concealer\ndidn't look dry at all in the area around the eyes, which\ndidn't creep into the wrinkles at all, blatant coverage,\nall those claims that you heard\nagain and again in some YouTube videos or in reels and, and, and.\nYou can't imagine\nthe amount of money I've really invested in concealer,\nonly to find that these concealers\nonly seem to work on the skin or around the eyes of a 12-year-old person,\nor someone who might still be in their 20s.\nBut I'm approaching 35.\nI have laugh lines here and there.\nThe area around my eyes is relatively dry\nand I simply can't use certain concealers\nbecause it looks so blatantly dry and extremely tight.\nAnd one of these concealers that has been so hyped\nis the Good Apple Concealer by KVD Beauty.\nAnother concealer\nI didn't like at all is Anastasia Beverly Hills.\nI also found it too dry and crusty on my skin.\nAnd me yeah, I've actually spent\nhundreds\nof dollars just on concealer only\nto be disappointed because just all these hyped concealers\nfor my rather dry and already \u2013 how do I put it?\n\u2013\nhave not worked in the advanced age eye area.\nAnd I recently\ndiscovered this Revolution concealer while\nlooking for an alternative to my First Aid Beauty concealer\n. And I always have my problems with Revolution\nbecause it's really hard to find products there that work for you.\nA lot of it is kind of stupid, but sometimes you get lucky\nand this is definitely one of those lucky finds.\nThis is the revolution in Real Life Filter\nFinish Soft Matte Concealer and I love it so much.\nSo it doesn't feel dry at all in the eye area\nand I like the opacity.\nSo it's not a full coverage concealer, so there's still a bit of skin showing\nthrough.\nOf course you can build it up, but because it doesn't dry so blatantly\n, it may\nmove\naround the eye area a bit more, which means it\ncan creep into wrinkles.\nBut for me personally, that's just a lot more pleasant than when\nconcealer dries like cement in the eye area and the whole thing looks\nlike some sand desert or crumble cake.\nSo if you also have an eye area like me\nand are tired of\nwalking around with totally dry concealers for over 40 \u20ac or for 30 \u20ac.\nCheck out Revolution's!\nI personally really like it, especially for the price.\nAnother lucky find from Revolution is definitely the Fast Base Blush Stick.\nAnd that's the color peach.\nI'd love to show you this up close, but it just looks so\ndisgusting because I use it very, very regularly.\nBut I'm also wearing it on my cheeks today.\nIn general, I actually mainly\nused all the alternative products to do my make-up.\nAccordingly, you can also see it here.\nAnd this is a cheap alternative to the Fenty\nBeauty Cream Blush in the color Peach Face.\nIt's also a peach-coral color,\nbut of course it's a lot cheaper compared to the Fenty Blush.\nI don't want to say that the two are similar in texture\nor that they are totally identical, because they are definitely not.\nI just think that the Fenty Cream Blushes\nhave this very special lightness about them.\nThey have a super thin texture that is almost weightless on the skin.\nAnd I also think that the blushes\nare not too heavily pigmented, which means you can build them up wonderfully little by little.\nThis blush stick, on the other hand, is\na little, how do I put it?, EMOLLIENT.\nSo it feels a bit more nourishing, a bit heavier as soon as you\npick it up with the brush and start applying it to the skin.\nBut once it dries, you won't notice any difference.\nAnd that's why I just think that the Revolution Fast\nBase Blush Stick is a wonderful alternative to the Fenty\nCream Blushes.\nI've already looked to see\nif I'd like to try the other\ncolors, but they've always been sold out.\nSo at least the other colors that would have interested me.\nIn case you see it in the drugstore somewhere.\nI think Rossmann sometimes has Revolution counters,\nthen you should definitely grab one.\nIf you have tried one of the alternative products,\nplease share your experiences in the comments below.\nAnd even if you\nknow and have tested the more expensive things, i.e. the \"high-end\" products, then you are of course\nwelcome to type your experiences in the comments.\nAnd if you liked this type of video and want more\nof it,\nyou can\nof course always make suggestions about other high-end products\nthat I should try\nand look at and for which I should look for an alternative.\nAnd of course I would also be very happy if you share the video\nbecause it helps my channel grow enormously\nand continue to bring you this content.\nAnd yes, if you'd like to see another alternative product video,\njust click here and we'll see you next time.",

Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

Was mich definitiv interessieren w\u00fcrde w\u00e4ren gut reflektierende und nicht zu glitzerige Highlighter. Ich war nie ne Highlighter-Person und teste mich da gerade erst durch. Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes.

Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

        "description": "Charlotte Tilbury New Matte Blush Wand Full Details:  http://bit.ly/3kSVM0w \nFull Face of Charlotte Tilbury viral makeup, best sellers and new releases. Hollywood Flawless Filter has to be one of the most hyped makeup products from Charlotte Tilbury. This face base filter is most used as a primer before foundation all over the face. Personally, I only like to apply Hollywood Flawless Filter on the high points of my face to highlight those features. A new single eyeshadow called Pillow Talk Hypnotizing Pop Shot Eyeshadow in shade Violet is stunning and so easy to wear on its own to make your eyes pop. I love the way the violet shade brings out my green eyes. \n\nOne of the biggest makeup launches by Charlotte Tilbury is Pillow Talk. Pillow talk has so many makeup products under the line from mascara, eyeshadow, highlighter, lipstick, lip liner and so much more. \n\nAnother Charlotte Tilbury makeup product that is being duped is the famous Hollywood Contour Wand. It\u2019s an award winning liquid contour wand that is really easy to use for everyday to get the perfect contour. The newest makeup release from Charlotte Tilbury is the Matte Beauty Blush Wand. There are four shades to chose from that provide a soft wash of color with a matte finish. To set my makeup, I use Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Finish. This pressed powder is really finely milled and looks flawless on the skin while setting the makeup in place. \n\nPersonally, I think Charlotte Tilbury eyebrow products are overlooked. Her Brow Cheat eyebrow pencil paired with the tinted Legendary Brows is a match made in heaven. Brow cheat pencil has a creamy formula that allows to draw brow hair like strokes, while Legendary Brow tinted gel sets my brows for an all day wear. \n\nPillow Talk is iconic in Charlotte Tilbury lip formulas from lip liners to lipsticks. My personal favorite shades from lip liners are Pillow Talk 2 and Icon Nude. If you\u2019re looking for a matte lipstick with comfortable wear throughout the day, check out Charlotte Tilbury Matte Revolution lipstick collection. The iconic Pillow Talk lipstick is a beautiful nude-pink with a soft matte finish. Some of my other favorite lipstick formulas include Hot Lips and Hot Lips 2. Both lipstick formulas have a satin finish. \n\nProducts Used/Mentioned:\nFenty Beauty Eyeshadow Primer: https://bit.ly/3She200 \n*Pillow Talk Hypnotizing Pop Shot Eyeshadow (Violet): http://bit.ly/41MgPTc  \n*Matte & Metallic Eye Colour Magic Liner Duo (Copper Charge): http://bit.ly/3ZrEMxv \nPillow Talk Push Up Lashes Mascara: http://bit.ly/3Sg0ksx \n*Legendary Lashes Vol 2 Mascara: http://bit.ly/3YowXar \nBeautiful Skin Foundation (2 Neutral): http://bit.ly/3DAQu0x \nRose and Ben C42 Foundation Brush: https://bit.ly/3IwbfM0 \nBeautiful Skin Concealer: http://bit.ly/3Um9iGa \n*Rare Beauty Concealer Brush: https://bit.ly/32iWAQ8 \nHollywood Contour Wand: http://bit.ly/41RnQSy \n*Makeup By Mario F1 Face Brush: https://bit.ly/3rwp7ym \n*Beautiful Skin Sun-Kissed Glow Cream Bronzer: https://bit.ly/3JNA0TX \nMatte Beauty Blush Wand (Pink Pop, Peach Pop, Dream Pop): http://bit.ly/3kSVM0w \nRose and Ben C41 Blush Brush: https://bit.ly/3NfUJA9 \n*Airbrush Flawless Skin Pressed Powder (Fair): http://bit.ly/2y0GScO \n*Rare Beauty Powder Brush: https://bit.ly/3gsevdN \n*Brow Cheat (Soft Brown): https://bit.ly/3lNesgy \n*Legendary Brows (Soft Brown): https://bit.ly/38X6ABU \n*Glow Glide Face Architect Highlighter (Moonlit Glow): http://bit.ly/3Yqrujq \n*Lip Cheat Lip Liner (Pillow Talk, Iconic Nude): http://bit.ly/2YVq2fj \n*Hot Lips Lipstick (Kim K.W.): http://bit.ly/2KO6kYZ \n*Hot Lips 2 Lipstick (In Love With Olivia): https://bit.ly/3qWz6JW \n\n*Affiliate link from RewardStyle.",

        "transcript_text": "- Charlotte Tilbury's viral makeup.\nWe're doing a full face.\nIt's a mixture of her OG products\nand then some new products\nthat she has recently released.\nA lot of these I already owned.\nI already talked about it.\nI love a lot of them.\nAnd then some of them I haven't tried yet.\nI'm excited.\nLet's begin with the eyes,\nbecause we have eyeshadows.\nThis is Charlotte Tilbury's,\nher new Pillow Talk Hypnotizing\nPop Shot, single eyeshadows.\nThey're \"easy color to make your eyes pop.\"\nI got this shade right here,\nwhich I'm so excited that\nI was able to pick it up.\nPillow Talk Ultraviolet.\nIt's a multi-dimensional eyeshadow\nand that's the color, so\nstunning, let's watch her.\nFirst step, I'm priming the eyelids.\nThis is not Charlotte Tilbury's,\nthis is a Fenty Beauty eyeshadow primer.\nI'm just gonna need my\nfingers to blend this in\nand give it a couple of\nminutes, not a couple minutes,\ncouple of seconds to set.\nI'm just gonna take my fingertip,\nit doesn't feel dry,\nit has a nice texture to it.\nOh my goodness, wow, oh wow.\nWow.\nWow.\nThat is pigmented, oh, that's stunning.\nThere's a little bit of fallout\nunderneath, but it's not bad.\nWow, that's really stunning.\nI'm gonna take a bigger, fluffy brush\nand just very gently soften it.\nOkay, I think I want to add\na little bit of eyeliner,\nto my lash line and maybe tight line,\nbut I'm going to use her,\nit's like the two in one eyeliner.\nOne side is metallic and\nthe other side is matte.\nI'm going to use the matte side\nand this is in Copper charge,\nand I'm gonna gently kind of smoke it out.\nFor mascara, Charlotte Tilbury's\nPillow Talk, Pushup Lashes.\nThis one is everywhere,\nit's a viral mascara\nand she also came out with,\nI think it's a either a red or a brown,\nversion of this mascara.\nThe one that I have is super\nblack and I don't love it.\nI don't even like this mascara,\nIt does not wear well on my lashes,\nit really weighs my lashes down.\nIt transfers, it smudges\nand it flakes on me,\nthroughout the day, so I\njust don't like this mascara.\nI did get a new one from her.\nThis is Legendary Lashes\nVolume two in black vinyl.\nSo I was thinking we could do one to one,\njust to show you guys the difference.\nSo right side Legendary\nLashes, volume two,\nleft Side Pillow Talk, Pushup Lashes.\nThat was not bad, it's\nactually really pretty.\nPillow Talk Pushup\nLashes on the left side,\nthe Pillow Talk Pushup mascara,\nit's a lot more intense,\nDo you see what I'm talking about?\nThe formula, it's a little,\nit's almost like pasty.\nOverall both Mascara's\nby Charlotte Tilbury,\nthey're pretty mediocre,\nif I'm gonna be honest.\nbut Legendary Lashes I\nthink it was easier to apply\nand I'm getting a little bit\nmore definition and length. \nI'm getting a lot more volume and pigment,\nfrom Pillow Talk Pushup Lashes.\nIf I were to say one product,\nis the most viral from Charlotte Tilbury,\nI would say it's the\nHollywood Flawless Filter,\nbut I think what's making it viral,\nis the Elf Halo Glow Filter,\nperfect dupe for this,\nin my opinion. \nElf looks great on its own,\nbut I personally am not a fan,\nof the Hollywood Flawless\nFilter all over my face.\nI like it only in certain areas\nand that's what I'm going to do.\nI like it on the high points of the face,\na little bit on the nose\na little bit right here,\nI'm just gonna take my brush,\nthat I'm going to use my\nfoundation with and work this in.\nFor foundation, Charlotte Tilbury\nBeautiful Skin Foundation.\nI like this one for those days,\nwhere I want my skin to look supple,\nvery plump, very hydrated.\nIt's not the most long-lasting,\nso if I'm not wearing a primer,\nit's gonna last between\nsix to eight hours,\njust because it never\nreally fully sets down,\nbecause it is so hydrating.\nSo I think if I were to\nrecommend this to someone,\nI would say, if you have\nvery dry skin, mature skin,\nsomeone that wants that\nbeautiful glow dewy skin,\nthroughout the day, I\nthink you will enjoy this.\nThe texture is very thick\nand you don't need that much product\nYou can use your fingers to apply this.\nYou can use a damped sponge or a brush.\nI personally prefer a\nbrush for my foundations.\nAnd this specific one is the newest,\nRose and Ben Her C42\nbrush, which is amazing,\namazing for foundation.\nThis foundation, if\nyou apply heavy handed,\nif you do like two pumps,\nI don't think it looks\nbeautiful on the skin,\nas the name suggests.\nI think a little bit goes a long way,\nwith this foundation to get\nthe best texture on the skin.\nBut I mean, look at that glow.\nIt does have a little bit of tackiness,\nbut very, very slight.\nLet's move on for, you know what,\nlet's do the liquid contour first.\nThis is another really\nviral Charlotte Tilbury,\nmakeup product, her contour wand.\nAnd I recently checked\nthe dupe from Milani.\nWhat is it, the Conceal and\nContour, the Liquid contour.\nAnd I think it's actually better,\nthe Milani, than the Charlotte Tilbury,\nThis is what it looks like\nand I personally like to\nblend it in right away.\nI find that it does set kind of fast.\nBut I think if you\napply it to those areas,\nwhere you want that contour,\nit blends in really nice.\nThere's a big conspiracy\naround this product,\nthat this entire tube,\nit's filled with air\nand if you compare how\nmuch you get versus Milani,\nMilani you actually get less.\nI think the Charlotte Tilbury one,\nthey're saying you get 0.41 fluid ounces,\nversus Milani it was 0.2 oz.\nAnd the brush I was using\nwas Makeup by Mario F1 brush.\nMoving on to concealer,\nCharlotte Tilbury's,\nbeautiful skin Radiant concealer,\nsame family as the\nBeautiful Skin Foundation.\nI like to actually wear\nthese both together.\nJust you know, for that\nreally beautiful radiant glow.\nAgain, just like the foundation,\na little bit goes a long way.\nIt's a thicker concealer\nformula, as you can see.\nIt's almost pasty and\nwhen you touch it also,\nit has a good like cream texture\nbut again, a little bit goes a long way.\nAnd I'm using Rare Beauty concealer brush,\none of my favorites.\nAnd I'm just really gently\npacking this concealer,\nin places where I need to either brighten,\nconceal and lift my under eye area.\nAnd just like with the\nBeautiful Skin Foundation,\nif you go heavy handed it\nwill make your under eyes,\nlook heavier and accentuated.\nI prefer a lighter touch\nand it gives a beautiful finish.\nFor blushes, we're gonna go\nwith her new hottest release,\nCharlotte Tilbury's Pillow\ntalk matte beauty blush wand.\nIt's a matte blush. \nSo I have the three shades,\nthat we could get on Sephora.\nCoral, we have a nice soft\npink, and then a beautiful red.\nYou just gently squeeze.\nOoh, they have a beautiful texture.\nVery blendable, wow.\nPink Pop:\nThat's so satisfying.\nIt's a little warmer than I thought.\nSo you can see it looks intimidating,\nbut when you really blend it in,\nit gives us the most\nbeautiful soft wash of color.\nAnd then we have, what is this one?\nPeach pop, ooh, ooh, this\none's really pretty too.\nAnd they have a really\nnice soft velvet texture.\nAll right, let's start with the pink pop first\nand then we can layer.\nGive it a little squeeze.\nThere we go.\nThe blush brush by Rose and Ben, C41.\nThat's really pretty.\nI actually really like that.\nAnd I'm putting three dots\nand it does blend really nice.\nI'm also not letting the\nblush sit on my cheeks,\nTo set all of my glowy makeup,\nI'm going to use another very viral,\nOG Charlotte Tilbury makeup product,\nher airbrush setting,\nflawless finishing powder.\nRight here I am in Shade 1 Fair.\nAnd I like the setting powder\nbecause it's so finely milled.\nAnd if you layer it throughout the day,\nif you get oily like I do in my T-zone\nit does not look heavy\nand cakey whatsoever.\nIt sets your makeup, but still\nprovides a beautiful glow,\nfrom within providing a really nice,\nsoft airbrushed finish like\na very soft blurring effect.\nI'm gonna use my Rare Beauty powder brush.\nJust loaded it nicely on there.\nI'm gonna soften it like my palm.\nJust like airbrushes the skin.\nWithout making it look\nreally flat and matte,\nI keep looking at myself,\njust seeing I don't have my eyebrows on.\nIt's taking me back to\nmy high school days.\nAll right, let's do the eyebrows,\nwhile we're there while\nwe're talking about 'em.\nTwo of my favorite products\nby Charlotte Tilbury,\nFor eyebrows first one being,\nher micro precision brow pencil.\nHer brow cheat in shade natural brown,\nwith her legendary brows,\nthe micro precision tinted brow gel.\nJust on its own the brow gel is beautiful.\nI love that it's extremely tiny.\nLook at that tiniest little spoolie ever.\nBut her brow pencil, it's\nactually really beautiful.\nI would say it's a\nmixture between a pomade\nand a pencil formula.\nIt's creamy, but it wears really well,\nand it's easy to fill in your brows,\ncreating those really\nnice hair-like strokes.\nWhat a difference it makes your eyebrows.\nI'm just taking the brow\ngel, the tinted brow gel\nand just gently brushing through the hair.\nI'm gonna finish off the lower lash line,\nusing that same eyeshadow,\nwith a Natasha Denona number four brush.\nIt's like a really tiny\nlittle packing smudger brush.\nI'm actually gonna place\nthat same eyeliner,\nOn the lower lash line.\nMascara, Pillow Talk\nPushup on the left eye,\nand then legendary\nlashes on the right eye.\nSo a new product by Charlotte Tilbury,\nanother viral product from her.\nThe Hollywood Glow Glide,\nface architect, highlighter,\nglowing, lifted younger looking skin,\nfor cheeks, nose, jawline, eyes and lips.\nI picked up shade Moon Lit Glow,\nlooks pretty it's a little, it's frosted.\nFeel like a little bit will go a long way.\nIt's like a powder version of\nthe Hollywood Flawless Filter.\nI'm not a big fan of powder\nhighlighters right now.\nI'll take a cream or a\nliquid any day over a powder.\nI'd rather use the Charlotte Tilbury,\nHollywood Flawless filter to\nhighlight the high points,\nof my face rather than a powder.\nIt's not bad, but it just, you know,\nit looks like glitter\nsitting on top of my skin.\nI'm just, I'm not all about that.\nTexture, I think it's a little chalky,\nit's nice and creamy,\nbut I think it looks a\nlittle chalky on the skin.\nI'm just taking a little\nbit of the highlighter\nand putting it right\ninto the inner corner.\nThat looks really pretty\non top of that purple,\nthat lilac, and just a little\nbit below the brow bone.\nLet's move on to the lips.\nLast and final by Charlotte Tilbury,\nher iconic her viral lip products.\nThe iconic lip liner\nshade has to be Pillow Talk.\nShe has lines dedicated\nsimply to pillow talk.\nThis is the original.\nI know she has pillow talk, I think,\nintensity two, three.\nI would say this is my first\nfavorite lip liner shade,\nin iconic n.\nIt's a little darker.\nIt's not as pink.\nBut I like wearing this with,\nI will share my favorite\nlipstick from her.\nSo this lipstick is Charlotte Tilbury's,\nher matte and it's a hot\nLips in shade Kim KW.\nand I love pairing it,\nwith either the pillow talk\nor the iconic n lip liner\nor for more of an\neveryday type of a color,\nit's a little more rosy pink.\nI like this one.\nIt's takes on her hot lips,\nbut it's a satin version.\nIt's not matte.\nAnd this is called In Love with Olivia.\nBut I like this color,\nfor like an everyday mixed\nwith either lip liner again,\nI'm gonna go with pillow\nTalk today for lip liner.\nLet's take a little bit of Kim KW.\nI kind of think I want iconic nude.\nI can't help myself.\nLooks really pretty.\nIt's reminding me of Spring. \nWe have really beautiful purple, pink,\nwhite flowers that are\nblossoming right now outside\nand this is giving me that vibe.\nThank you guys so much for\nwatching this full face,\nof Charlotte Tilbury's viral\nmakeup that are bestsellers.\nI would say definitely try the foundation,\nthe concealer, the\nfinishing setting powder.\nThe eyeshadows are stunning.\nThey're beautiful.\nAlso recommend her brow products.\nI think they're really overlooked.\nThese new blushes I am\nreally impressed with.\nI like the formula so far.\nAgain, not the biggest fan of the mascara.\nI'm not the biggest fan of her eyeliners.\nI think they're creamy enough,\nbut I wish they had or have more pigment,\na little more punch, intensity.\nI do enjoy her lipsticks,\nbut they're not my favorite.\nAnd I do enjoy her lip liners,\nbut again they're not my favorite.\nLast but not least, Charlotte Tilbury,\nHollywood Flawless Filter.\nI don't recommend it.\nI think it's way over\nhyped for how people use it\nand how it looks on the skin, in reality,\nif you have pores and if you have texture,\nit will accentuate the texture,\nbecause it's literally illuminating\nand highlighting the bumps and the texture\nand the pores on your skin.\nOne other product I forgot to mention\nand I didn't use in today's\nvideo is her cream bronzer.\nI actually like this\nmore than the contour.\nHer cream contour, it's like\na bronzer and contour in one.\nIt definitely pulls\nwarmer on my skin tone,\nrather than cooler.\nAnd I think the cream bronzer is flawless.\nIt's beautiful, very\nblendable, easy to work with.\nThe only thing, it's not as long lasting.\nI do like to pair the cream bronzer,\nwith a powder bronzer on top\nto set it and lock it in place.\n- I wasn't gonna do an update,\nbut might as well do an update\nbefore I take my makeup off\nat the end of the night.\nLipstick is still on.\nEyeshadow still looks really good.\nEyeliners still on.\nMascara, both sides has transferred,\nthey both have transferred,\nflaking moreso,\nactually on the Legendary\nLashes versus Pillow Talk.\nPillow talk, again, it\ntransfers and smudges,\nit flakes on me,\nbut the Legendary has a\nlittle bit more flaking.\nI'm not sure why.\nFoundation, it's nice, it's\npretty oily on the forehead.\nI didn't really touch up with\npowder throughout the day.\nBut wanted to show you guys that.\nThe lipstick and lip liner does\nlast a good amount of time.\nBoth formulas, they're\nnot my favorite formulas,\nnot the most comfortable.\nAs you can see, my lips\nlook a little, a little dry,\na little wrinkly, but they do\nlast a good amount of time.\nAnd I ate Chick-Fil-A with\nthe kids and it's still,\nit's still on my lips,\nbut blush is still on.\nI still see the blush, brows look okay.\nAnd I still don't like the highlighter.\nI thought I was gonna like it more\nwith the foundation kind of\nmelting more into my skin\nand like my natural oils peeking through.\nI don't like the highlighter.\nI think it's too glittery.\nIt's a little too chunky,\neven though it's pretty,\nit's a pretty highlighter,\nbut it's not as finely\nmilled as I would want it to.\nIt's a little chalky.\nAll right, I'm gonna end it here\nwith a quick little update\nand hope you guys enjoyed this video.\nBye.",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

Was mich definitiv interessieren w\u00fcrde w\u00e4ren gut reflektierende und nicht zu glitzerige Highlighter. Ich war nie ne Highlighter-Person und teste mich da gerade erst durch. Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

Diese Dinger sind ja extra so konzipiert, dass sie die Haut reizen und damit die Lippen aufplustern. Ich glaube teilweise ist da auch so Chili, Pfefferminz und sowas drin. Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

sponsoring\u00a0\u00a0\nthe beginning part of this video I'm actually\u00a0\na separate customer I recently started my own\u00a0\u00a0\nsubscription so when senpin reached out to me\u00a0\nand asked me if I want to work with them I was\u00a0\u00a0\nsuper excited because this was a service that I\u00a0\nwas already using and already enjoying Sanford\u00a0\u00a0\nis a new way for you to discover purchase\u00a0\nand even experience fragrances separate is\u00a0\u00a0\na subscription-based service which lets you\u00a0\nget one fragrance every month that you choose\u00a0\u00a0\nno surprises where you get a 30 day supply and\u00a0\nyou can try out the fragrance yourself before\u00a0\u00a0\ndeciding if you want to try it again because of\u00a0\ncourse you can choose the same fragrance again\u00a0\u00a0\nor if you want to buy a full size because we all\u00a0\nknow and this is something that I have said as\u00a0\u00a0\nwell full size fragrances are so expensive and\u00a0\nit's so nice to be trying them out before you\u00a0\u00a0\nlike fully commit and buy them and I've been\u00a0\nvery very vocal in letting you know to do not\u00a0\u00a0\nblind buy full-size fragrances December is the\u00a0\nperfect way for you to discover what kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nfragrances do you like what kind of fragrances\u00a0\ndo you not like trying out a 30-day supply of a\u00a0\u00a0\nfragrance that you've been interested in before\u00a0\nfully committing and buying the full size and I\u00a0\u00a0\nwill say within these little containers you\u00a0\nactually get quite a lot of fragrance and I\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I said I do have semper myself the fragrance\u00a0\nthat I got last month my actually my one for this\u00a0\u00a0\nmonth is out for delivery I have not used it up\u00a0\nand I've been pretty generous with how much I've\u00a0\u00a0\nbeen spraying it so there definitely is enough\u00a0\nperfume in here to last you for 30 days if you\u00a0\u00a0\nwanted to commit to this one and fully wear it for\u00a0\n30 days and Sanford carries a lot of well-known\u00a0\u00a0\nBrands like Prada Gucci Versace but you can also\u00a0\nfind some smaller Brands like Skylar heretic or\u00a0\u00a0\nConfessions of a rebel and I like trying out new\u00a0\nfun brands that might not be as easy to find in\u00a0\u00a0\nstores and here you just get to try it out for a\u00a0\nmonth get it sent to your door and you can just\u00a0\u00a0\ndecide for yourself if any of these fragrances\u00a0\nare for you and with my code Nick we still get\u00a0\u00a0\n55 of your order meaning that you can get the\u00a0\nfirst month for only seven dollars and then it\u00a0\u00a0\nis 17 a month for you to try out perfumes\u00a0\nand they have some really expensive ones\u00a0\u00a0\nwell that you can try out and I just think that\u00a0\nthis is such a cool server and like I said I am\u00a0\u00a0\nmyself a customer of semper and I will continue\u00a0\nmy subscription and I will let you know in my\u00a0\u00a0\nmonthly haul which fragrance I got for myself\u00a0\nbut now let me show you which ones I got from\u00a0\u00a0\nscentbird I got three different fragrances and I\u00a0\ngot three different colors of my little containers\u00a0\u00a0\nit says centered on and you like this is locked\u00a0\nand this is when you can like open the container\u00a0\u00a0\nto put it out I think I already showed you and\u00a0\nthen you do it like this and then you can spray\ndid you see that and the one that I have myself\u00a0\nlike this is my own this is the gray one that I\u00a0\u00a0\nhave for my uh subscription they gave me some\u00a0\ncards as well so they can I can describe it\u00a0\u00a0\nin this yellowy one we have Saint Vincent's\u00a0\nand the Grenadines from nativa and this is a\u00a0\u00a0\nfragrance that I am not familiar with this one is\u00a0\nsomething that I don't usually like because this\u00a0\u00a0\none is a very floraly perfume it has Jasmine\u00a0\nplumeria orange flower violet leave and musk\u00a0\u00a0\nbut both me and my husband agreed that this is\u00a0\na very well composed fragrance and if I were to\u00a0\u00a0\never do a floral fake fragrance this would be\u00a0\nit this smells expensive and well put together\u00a0\u00a0\nand honestly I really like the blend of this one\u00a0\nand even though I don't like florally perfumes I\u00a0\u00a0\nactually really enjoy this one and then we have\u00a0\nthe Ormond Jane Ormond woman and this has black\u00a0\u00a0\nHemlock coriander grass oil Jasmine and violet\u00a0\nand for me this smells a little bit too much\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom a violet which isn't one of my favorite\u00a0\nnotes but again this is what this service is\u00a0\u00a0\nabout it's about you discovering What notes you\u00a0\nreally love and which notes you don't love so\u00a0\u00a0\nfor me I love the black Hemlock and the grass if\u00a0\nI love fragrances that smell like grass I know\u00a0\u00a0\nit's crazy but I love the note of grass grass is\u00a0\njust one of my favorite notes but the Violet is\u00a0\u00a0\ntaking over a little bit for me and same here I\u00a0\ndon't love florally perfumes but I realize that\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen they're Jasmine I actually really do enjoy\u00a0\nthem I also have the Hope sport which is green\u00a0\u00a0\ngreen Citrus tuberose and Lily of the Valley\u00a0\nthis one is very very florally it's almost it's\u00a0\u00a0\nit has a memory it's like memory unlocked because\u00a0\nmy grandmother used to love lily of the valley and\u00a0\u00a0\nagain I'm not that much into floraly perfumes I\u00a0\ndo love the Jasmine over the lily of the valley\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I think it smells really put together like\u00a0\nthis one smells like someone has their life\u00a0\u00a0\ntogether like I would trust this perfume with my\u00a0\npension so those are the three fragrances that\u00a0\u00a0\nthey send to me but of course when you join\u00a0\nthis you can choose whatever you want they\u00a0\u00a0\nhave a scent test on their website as well that\u00a0\nyou can just put in what you normally like and\u00a0\u00a0\ndislike and they will suggest some perfumes\u00a0\nbased on that and I just think this is such\u00a0\u00a0\na fun service and I'm so thrilled and excited\u00a0\nthat I'm able to work with Center so check out\u00a0\u00a0\nthe info in the description box if you want to\u00a0\nsee what my discount code is again and uh thank\u00a0\u00a0\nyou again semper for working with me I am one\u00a0\nhappy customer

I'm filming this and this\u00a0\nis the cool matte obsessions this one offers\u00a0\u00a0\nway more contrast so I do think that even though\u00a0\nI prefer warm eyeshadows on me I think that

audience of YouTube to be\u00a0\nwatching I feel like I have a fussy in my eye\nI probably do can we talk\u00a0\nabout this one as well this is\u00a0\u00a0\nwhoever's running marketing over at Natasha\u00a0\ndenona I don't know what you're doing\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know because now it's available this\u00a0\nis the and it says highly anticipated by whom\nby by whom\nhonestly we forgot about this one Natasha\u00a0\nwe forgot about this one this is the\u00a0\u00a0\num Natasha didn't know that love face palette\u00a0\nthis was accidentally leaked like two weeks\u00a0\u00a0\nbefore uh Valentine's Day on look fantastic a\u00a0\nbunch of us bought it and were able to do videos\u00a0\u00a0\non it and now she's releasing it beginning\u00a0\nof March why like it's the love face palette\u00a0\u00a0\nall of our other love palettes love things have\u00a0\nbeen because she has too many love palettes and\u00a0\u00a0\na bigger love palette all of those have been\u00a0\nlike with Valentines and this one March I\u00a0\u00a0\nmean I understand something's going on behind the\u00a0\nscenes something shipment is late or something but\u00a0\u00a0\nI really wish that they would have just been\u00a0\nlike because she was started starting to like\u00a0\u00a0\nsneak peek it she's like We're sneak peek\u00a0\nin our new launch and all of us were like\u00a0\u00a0\nwe know I've had this for a month now I\u00a0\nthink I've had it for a month because I\u00a0\u00a0\ndidn't even haul it in February\u00a0\nso I must have got it in January\u00a0\u00a0\nanyways it is available I have a video\u00a0\nI will link the video down below um\nI am confusion this one is also available now and\u00a0\nthis is that palette from fantasy cosmetica I use\u00a0\u00a0\nthis in was that Tuesday's video Wednesday's\u00a0\nvideo Tuesday's video I think it was Tuesday\u00a0\u00a0\nwhere I did some swatches and I did look with this\u00a0\nI did it get ready with me I really enjoyed the\u00a0\u00a0\nlook that I did with this palette this palette is\u00a0\nby far my favorite palette from fantasy cosmetica\u00a0\u00a0\nuh it did sell out she has a pre-order open\u00a0\nright now in case you were interested you can\u00a0\u00a0\nuse the code and Jessica and get 10 off she's\u00a0\nalso selling the shadows as singles and she's\u00a0\u00a0\nalso selling to Mainland us those perfumes if you\u00a0\nwant to see some swatches and if you want to hear\u00a0\u00a0\nme like talk about this palette and talk about\u00a0\nthese perfumes check out the video I think I'll\u00a0\u00a0\nlink that one down below as well so you can\u00a0\ncheck it out but yeah I'm very impressed with\u00a0\u00a0\nthis palette I think this is the best palette\u00a0\nlike I said that they have done and I just I\u00a0\u00a0\njust really enjoy it I think the color story is\u00a0\nsmart I think the shades are beautiful I have no\u00a0\u00a0\nproblems working with it whatsoever I love the\u00a0\nlook so much I just really think that this was\u00a0\u00a0\nthe smash hit for the brand and I'm so excited\u00a0\nfor them because I just really think it's so\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful another inner brand that had a small\u00a0\nrelease and also they had a restock was Cleo nut\u00a0\u00a0\nand they released a solder and redox uh in the\u00a0\nmulti-chrome um stained glass collection and you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan use my code and just can get some money off\u00a0\nat Cleona actually it works on the stained glass\u00a0\u00a0\nnow as well in case you are interested and I don't\u00a0\nknow if these are still available or if there are\u00a0\u00a0\nstill Shades available in the restock Cleona has\u00a0\na tendency of selling out when they have restock\u00a0\u00a0\nbut you can always check that out I think these\u00a0\ntwo new shades look really really pretty they seem\u00a0\u00a0\nto be a pinky bronze to a green and then there\u00a0\nis like a smoky purple to almost a bluish even\u00a0\u00a0\ndarker Smoky purple does that make sense at all I\u00a0\nhave no idea I'm just basing this out of swatches\u00a0\u00a0\nI do not have that one um in my collection right\u00a0\nnow tart has released some shape tape correctors\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is described as the first ever Plumping\u00a0\ncharacter with Plumping hyaluronic acid and this\u00a0\u00a0\nis available in actually quite a few Shades and I\u00a0\nthink that this is a really smart release I will\u00a0\u00a0\nsay I have seen quite a lot of color correctors\u00a0\nthis past year and I'm like are we when was that\u00a0\u00a0\nwas that 2016 17 when everybody was releasing\u00a0\ncolor correctors I feel like that was 16 right\u00a0\u00a0\nI feel like that was that was a year of color\u00a0\ncorrectors I think that this looks really cool\u00a0\u00a0\nI just recently bought a color corrector like\u00a0\na foundation changer from La girl and that one\u00a0\u00a0\nis working out absolutely beautiful for me so I\u00a0\ndo not need another one but I definitely think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat there's a time and place for these and had\u00a0\nI not bought the one from Ella girl I might have\u00a0\u00a0\nbought this one instead just because I mean you\u00a0\nyou need at least I I need the smallest amount\u00a0\u00a0\nso smaller packaging might have been easier\u00a0\nfor me as someone who has a lot of makeup and\u00a0\u00a0\nsometimes travel with my makeup I just booked\u00a0\nthe trip this year I'm so excited I'm actually\u00a0\u00a0\nif you are not following me on my Vlog Channel I\u00a0\nalways do weekly Vlogs or weekend Vlogs or just\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent things around the house and then\u00a0\nI do travel Vlogs so I'm going to Houston\u00a0\u00a0\nfor the Houston rodeo with some friends I will\u00a0\nbe vlogging that and then I have two more trips\u00a0\u00a0\nplanned this year really big trips with influencer\u00a0\nfriends and I I am so excited I'm like vibrating\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm tearing up thinking about how excited how\u00a0\nexcited I am about these trips it's gonna be so\u00a0\u00a0\nmuch fun and I would have loved to bring something\u00a0\nlike this traveling that was that was The Detour\u00a0\u00a0\nof Our Generation oh can we talk about this one\u00a0\nthis is the new chroma cover luminous Foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nbut be perfect Cosmetics I giggled when I saw this\u00a0\nbecause I remember when my friend Heather tried\u00a0\u00a0\nthis Foundation that they released I think it\u00a0\nwas last year I become fairly sure that this was\u00a0\u00a0\nin her yearly like misses uh they released a full\u00a0\ncoverage foundation and she basically said that it\u00a0\u00a0\nwas like the worst foundations she's ever tried in\u00a0\nher life and she's tried quite a few foundations\u00a0\u00a0\num it was I mean she said it was horrible\u00a0\nit's just sitting on the skin looking like\u00a0\u00a0\na mask just looking thick and Cakey and\u00a0\njust not a good look this is supposed to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe a buildable coverage with Luminous Finish\u00a0\nbut I will say after that review I'm having\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm having less confidence in be perfect being\u00a0\nable to perfect the foundation some people really\u00a0\u00a0\nlove that full coverage Foundation though but me\u00a0\nand Heather do have a very similar taste when it\u00a0\u00a0\ncomes to foundations and if she says that it's one\u00a0\nof the worst foundations she's ever tried that's\u00a0\u00a0\nall I need to hear but this one is available now I\u00a0\nwill link down below there's quite a few Shades to\u00a0\u00a0\nchoose from but I think I'm gonna opt out I will\u00a0\nsay I'm a little bit intrigued by this because\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's a new mascara for Maybelline and one of my\u00a0\nfavorite mascaras is the Lash Sensational Sky High\u00a0\u00a0\nmascara love that one I actually realized that I\u00a0\ndidn't have a backup of that one I have run out\u00a0\u00a0\nof three of my favorite favorite products from the\u00a0\ndrugstore and I realized during the same day that\u00a0\u00a0\nI didn't have a backup of any three of them so I\u00a0\nneed to buy a backup of the Nyx banana powder I\u00a0\u00a0\nneed to buy a backup of the brow snatch pen from\u00a0\nNYX and I need to buy a backup of the last lash\u00a0\u00a0\nSensational this guy High mascara but maybe I'll\u00a0\ntry this one instead because this is The falsies\u00a0\u00a0\nSurreal extensions mascara by Maybelline and\u00a0\nit is a lengthening mascara lengthening and\u00a0\u00a0\nvolume but what I really need is the lengthening\u00a0\nI lean I need a lengthening mascara if you saw my\u00a0\u00a0\num rankings when was that that was this week as\u00a0\nwell I was talking about that mascara that has\u00a0\u00a0\nbeen you know mascara gate that mascara from\u00a0\nL'Oreal some people love it some people hate\u00a0\u00a0\nit some people are meh I'm a little bit meh\u00a0\nabout it I think it looks too voluminizing a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle bit clumpy almost plus I have poked myself\u00a0\nnumerous times in in my eyes with that wand it is\u00a0\u00a0\nthat that one is a lethal it should be classified\u00a0\nas a weapon so I didn't love that one and with\u00a0\u00a0\ntrying mascaras over the time here on YouTube\u00a0\nI've realized that what I'm really looking for\u00a0\u00a0\nin the mascara is a mascara that gives me a lift\u00a0\na curl and length I want the length I don't mind\u00a0\u00a0\nhow my lashes look like volumizing wise I just\u00a0\nwant them to look longer so this is introducing\u00a0\u00a0\nits hybrid fiber technology a mix of fibers of\u00a0\ndifferent sizes up to three millimeter and it\u00a0\u00a0\nextended Helix brush with loads lashes from root\u00a0\nto tip up to 24 hour wear which means that it's\u00a0\u00a0\nnot going to smudge or like flake off I guess\u00a0\nClump resistant see this is what I want Clump\u00a0\u00a0\nresistant smudge flake and smear assistant 9.99\u00a0\nit comes in Black blackest very black and brownish\u00a0\u00a0\nblack this is like a joke like the joke that me\u00a0\nand my friend has she's she's goth she loves the\u00a0\u00a0\nblack and she's basically says that she loves\u00a0\na bunch of colors very black pale black light\u00a0\u00a0\nblack dark black midnight black I felt this\u00a0\nis that this is like mascara for God people\u00a0\u00a0\nlove that for them but I'm excited about this\u00a0\nbecause it seems on the models like this is a\u00a0\u00a0\ncurling and like lengthening mascara so I'm going\u00a0\nto be trying this one out it says it's available\u00a0\u00a0\nnow have we seen this at Ulta because I kind of\u00a0\nwanna or should I order my NYX product somewhere\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat I'm trying to say with all of this is that I\u00a0\nme Angelica really need to head to the drugstore\u00a0\u00a0\nto scoop up a couple of my favorites that I have\u00a0\nbeen missing last week we talked about the new\u00a0\u00a0\nperfume from Joe Malone that was exclusive to\u00a0\nselfridges nowadays when you see exclusive it\u00a0\u00a0\nusually means we launch here first it very seldom\u00a0\nnowadays means we're only sold here it usually\u00a0\u00a0\nmeans especially with beauty that we're launching\u00a0\nhere first so the one of the perfumes which was\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Nashi Blossom that one launched at selfridges\u00a0\nbut now all four have been dropped and they are\u00a0\u00a0\navailable and there's also one of them is a hair\u00a0\nMist so this is the star magnolia Nashi blossoms\u00a0\u00a0\num water lily and osmanthus Blossom and the star\u00a0\nmagnolia also comes in a hair Mist I don't want to\u00a0\u00a0\nbuy any of these I love Joe Malone fragrances\u00a0\nthere is let's talk about the other fragrance\u00a0\u00a0\nafterwards there seems to be and I talked about\u00a0\nthat last week as well there seems to be a wave\u00a0\u00a0\nof really florally flowery bouquet kind of a sense\u00a0\nand I love fragrance but floor of fragrances are\u00a0\u00a0\nrarely my absolute favorite there are some that I\u00a0\nreally love and I sometimes I discover I'm like oh\u00a0\u00a0\nreally like this flower or oh I really like that\u00a0\nflower but overall it's not my absolute favorite\u00a0\u00a0\noh they also have a cologne Trio

from\u00a0\u00a0\nPeach and Lily and they're coming out with a glass\u00a0\nskin face polisher I think this is like the rice\u00a0\u00a0\nthe rice washed the one from tatcha where it's\u00a0\nlike a powder you mix with water and then you\u00a0\u00a0\nscrub it like a gentle exfoliator that eventually\u00a0\njust dissolves and just leaves your skin feeling\u00a0\u00a0\nvery it's like a nice face exfoliator it's\u00a0\nnot you know the crushed up walnuts I really\u00a0\u00a0\nlike the one from tatcha I've gone through\u00a0\none of those mini sizes and I could totally\u00a0\u00a0\nsee myself picking this one up I don't know\u00a0\nexactly what this is oh it's available now\nthis is me contemplating going to get it now\u00a0\u00a0\nyou need to hold off later I might get that later\u00a0\nbecause I do love the P I even went through that\u00a0\u00a0\nmatcha pudding cream it's in my empties it's all\u00a0\ngone through it and I've gone through one of the\u00a0\u00a0\nold cleansers as well I'm halfway through my\u00a0\nsecond one it's just a brand that I really\u00a0\u00a0\nenjoy there's a new studio fix everywhere all\u00a0\nover face pen from Mac Cosmetics this isn't\u00a0\u00a0\neverywhere all over face pen new concealer and\u00a0\nFoundation hybrid 36 hours coverage which just\u00a0\u00a0\nmeans that it's long wearing you know when I\u00a0\nput an hour claim it just means that it's long\u00a0\u00a0\nlike long wearing it's not gonna just like just\u00a0\nsmelt off your face which is really nice if you\u00a0\u00a0\nhave Contour oily skin look for something with\u00a0\na long hour wear claim it conceals brightens and\u00a0\u00a0\nevens tone lightweight flexible won't crease or\u00a0\ncake medium to full buildable coverage natural\u00a0\u00a0\nfinish while being waterproof oh that's really\u00a0\ncool I don't know exactly how this pen works\u00a0\u00a0\nbut it seems to be a really Nifty applicator if\u00a0\nI'm gonna be honest do you squeeze it do you click\u00a0\u00a0\nit or is it a clicky clicking me click it does\u00a0\nlook like it could be a clicky I could be about\u00a0\u00a0\nthis I could be it is available in Europe now and\u00a0\nis coming to the U.S soon I could be about this\u00a0\u00a0\ndepending on depending on there is a new\u00a0\ntrend collection coming from Essence I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nknow if this one is coming to the us or not it is\u00a0\navailable in Europe right now Essence is a German\u00a0\u00a0\nbrand owned by the same umbrella company that\u00a0\nhas Catrice as well and I will say that this one\u00a0\u00a0\nlooks very for me because it's oranges and pinks\u00a0\nthat blush lighter that's half orange half pink\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah I really want that one that orange lipstick\u00a0\neven the palette looks cute it's the blooming\u00a0\u00a0\nbright Trend Edition and I really think that this\u00a0\nlooks really cute I could be all about this this\u00a0\u00a0\nis in available like I said in Europe it's not\u00a0\nlike for certain that it's coming to the US but\u00a0\u00a0\nif it does I will for sure be picking up that um\u00a0\nblush duo at least because I think it is stunning\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is something that I have I see it over here I\u00a0\nused it in a Tuesday's video this is the sigma and\u00a0\u00a0\nKristen Dominique brush set this one is available\u00a0\nnow and I think the quality of these are beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nand I like the handles and I like the color of the\u00a0\nbristles the shapes of these are not perfect for\u00a0\u00a0\nme and I think that that just shows like I said in\u00a0\nthe video on Tuesday that everyone has different\u00a0\u00a0\npreferences for what they prefer when it comes to\u00a0\nshapes and bristles and lengths of bristles and\u00a0\u00a0\ncuts of bristles and all of that and these were\u00a0\nvery nice quality but not the perfect cuts for me\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich I think is very interesting to see honestly\u00a0\nbecause sometimes when I try favorite brushes like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Samantha Ramen Doll favorite set that's very\u00a0\nup my alley that set was very up my alley not\u00a0\u00a0\nperfect but very up my alley but yeah this one is\u00a0\navailable now I do have a call with Sigma makotus\u00a0\u00a0\nand Jessica but I don't think that you can use\u00a0\nthe code at least not right now sometimes you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan during special sales and stuff I don't think\u00a0\nyou can use it on collab items but you can use it\u00a0\u00a0\nif you buy anything else from Sigma can we talk\u00a0\nabout nail polish I never talk about nail polish\u00a0\u00a0\nbut when I saw these These are from mooncat and\u00a0\nthis is the goddess complex collection it consists\u00a0\u00a0\nof six lacquers they're 14 to 15 each depending\u00a0\non how special the pigments are in it and you can\u00a0\u00a0\nget the full bundle for 78 dollars at mooncat\u00a0\nthis looks beautiful but look at these nails\u00a0\u00a0\nI think they look so cool and I'm due to get\u00a0\nmy nails fixed should I do that before Houston\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe and I'm kind of like I don't want\u00a0\nto bring nail polish myself because like\u00a0\u00a0\nI I don't have many but I do have a couple if\u00a0\nI bring nail polish can they put gel on top\nare you snoring no I'm just I'm very new to\u00a0\nI don't buy or like use a lot of nail polish\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I always get my nails done but like I\u00a0\njust think that these look so cool and I know\u00a0\u00a0\nthat mooncat also had that amazing collection\u00a0\nwith the magnets that they can use I've used\u00a0\u00a0\nthose kind of magnet polishes at um at like a\u00a0\nsalon and they're always so cute but I'm like\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe I can be the person that like brings my\u00a0\nown nail polish is that weird some people are\u00a0\u00a0\ntelling me on Instagram that it's totally\u00a0\nnormal I've never seen anyone do that\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm just like is that normal because it\u00a0\ndoesn't feel normal this is a brand that\u00a0\u00a0\nwe never talk about I don't even know what they\u00a0\nhave been doing these past two years past two\u00a0\u00a0\nyears this is so Eva this is a new collection\u00a0\nfrom zoiva and I looked at this and I'm like\nagain Sova is a germany-based I think they are\u00a0\nin the brand but they are available at quite\u00a0\u00a0\nsome different stores in Germany and I think they\u00a0\nused to be available at Ulta but I don't know if\u00a0\u00a0\nthey are anymore but here's the reason why we\u00a0\nnever talk about Sova anymore because look at\u00a0\u00a0\nthis these are the quads what is this What What\u00a0\nIn the snooziest of Snooze fests are these quads\u00a0\u00a0\nwho said this was okay who looked at this\u00a0\nand said this will bring in customers\nso boring and monogamous and just like I uh maybe\u00a0\nit's the pictures maybe they look amazing in real\u00a0\u00a0\nlife but if they look amazing in real life you\u00a0\nneed to fire this photographer they look so\nthey look so boring and I heard somewhere\u00a0\nthat they're pretty expensive too\u00a0\u00a0\nthat was my friend Nikki Raven that told\u00a0\nme that they're expensive eyeshadow quads\u00a0\u00a0\n31 for an eyeshadow quad from sueva\u00a0\nthat looks like this absolutely not\nno no in 2023 we're not paying 31 for this\u00a0\nno put down your debit card we're not doing\u00a0\u00a0\nthat something I am contemplating buying\u00a0\nand I never thought that these words were\u00a0\u00a0\nwould like come over my lips on this channel\u00a0\nbut I'm contemplating buying this new eyeshadow\u00a0\u00a0\npalette that's coming from Too Faced I know I know\u00a0\npigs do fly hell's freezing over but is this not\u00a0\u00a0\nlooking kind of yummy this is from dupedat\u00a0\nand this is the new Too Faced Italian Spritz\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich is obviously a play on the aperol Spritz\u00a0\nwhich if you've been here for some time you know\u00a0\u00a0\nit's one of my favorite drinks for the summer I\u00a0\nactually did not have a single one last summer\nnow I'm like should I buy some aperol I love me\u00a0\na good up at all Spritz and honestly this palette\u00a0\u00a0\nI kind of like it it goes from really light to\u00a0\nreally dark both in shimmers and in mattes there\u00a0\u00a0\nare some colorful shimmers or some colorful mattes\u00a0\nthere are some mixing of some neutrals this looks\u00a0\u00a0\ncute I like it I think it is in the tin packaging\u00a0\nwhich from what I've heard from people who\u00a0\u00a0\nactually do review Too Faced is the good usually\u00a0\nthe good Too Faced quality and I'm like huh\nI might get this this might be\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause the Huda palettes was I think the only\u00a0\neyeshadow palette that I bought myself last month\u00a0\u00a0\nexcept that I bought the Modern Renaissance\u00a0\nfor that video but I think that these are the\u00a0\u00a0\nonly eyeshadow palettes that I bought myself\u00a0\nlast month maybe this will be my March one\ntwo-faced oh let's get into the weekly colourpop\u00a0\nsegment as well this is a little bit similar is\u00a0\u00a0\nthis not the same kind of vibe again this is a\u00a0\nheavy petal collection I'm saying floral florals\u00a0\u00a0\nfor spring groundbreaking but I think that this\u00a0\nlooks and I I say this with love I think this\u00a0\u00a0\nis the least exciting spring collection that\u00a0\ncolourpop has had in a bit again sometimes\u00a0\u00a0\nwith colourpop when you see the palettes in real\u00a0\nlife you're like oh this one had potential like\u00a0\u00a0\num that pretty police palette it's honestly so\u00a0\nmuch prettier than I thought it was going to be\u00a0\u00a0\nand so versatile and I really like it I rank that\u00a0\nin Wednesday's video so maybe I'll change my mind\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen I see it I actually have found a way to\u00a0\nsee whether or not I have packages coming in\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom colourpop and I did I do think I have one\u00a0\ncoming in from colourpop but it says it's coming\u00a0\u00a0\non Saturday so uh for that reason I tried to\u00a0\nnot work during the weekends I tried to take\u00a0\u00a0\nsome time off spend some times with my pets and my\u00a0\nhusband uh if I work during the weekends it's just\u00a0\u00a0\nme chill vlogging a little bit so I don't think\u00a0\nI'll be doing a dedicated video on these but if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou are very interested in these I might film it\u00a0\nget ready with me depending on how it looks in\u00a0\u00a0\nreal life because just on the picture I'm like no\u00a0\nbut I might change my mind when I see in real life\u00a0\u00a0\nyou never know it is available I think now I\u00a0\nthink it's dropping on Thursday I'm filming this\u00a0\u00a0\non Thursday and you can use the code on Jessica\u00a0\nand you get some money off at colourpop you're\u00a0\u00a0\nalso having a huge sale and they had that sale\u00a0\ngoing on for a while and I think there's still\u00a0\u00a0\nsome things on there the sale is crazy so if\u00a0\nyou had some things that you have been eyeing\u00a0\u00a0\non colourpop just go in on the side I will leave\u00a0\na link down below and just see so that none of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe things in your wish list are actually on a\u00a0\ncrazy deep discount because that sale has been\u00a0\u00a0\nbananas I like a good Innovation as much as the\u00a0\nnext person but I don't know who really asked\u00a0\u00a0\nto have this roller packaging that is already a\u00a0\nlittle bit cumbersome and hard to work with as it\u00a0\u00a0\nis now with highlighter in it because that's what\u00a0\niconic London did so this is the roll away glow\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlighter with a roll-on applicator and I love\u00a0\nthat Trend mood is using three exclamation points\u00a0\u00a0\nas if that is something to celebrate I feel like\u00a0\nit should be with a roll-on applicator dot dot dot\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause like what why who said this was okay I\u00a0\nthink that this is disaster waiting to happen\u00a0\u00a0\nI think that this is going to be one of those\u00a0\nit goes on Patchy the roller gets stuck you\u00a0\u00a0\naccidentally scratch a bit of your foundation\u00a0\noff I just I cannot wait to see what I am just\u00a0\u00a0\nimagining the train wreck of reviews that's going\u00a0\nto come on this one except on Tech talk of course\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause on Tick Tock all makeup is great all the\u00a0\ntime we have some more quotes to talk about and\u00a0\u00a0\nthese are from Vive and I have seen some sneak\u00a0\npeeks about this and I think I saw a was that\u00a0\u00a0\nlike someone was showing me like a picture of them\u00a0\nbeing in the background of our video or something\u00a0\u00a0\nbut these are quads so I've known about these\u00a0\nfor a bit but now they are available and it's\u00a0\u00a0\nfour different quads it is shimmers and mattes\u00a0\nI think one of them isn't all math and the other\u00a0\u00a0\nones are three mattes and a shimmer these aren't\u00a0\nfor me the main reason being that uh the The Rosy\u00a0\u00a0\none and the orange one could have been for me\u00a0\nif there had been a bigger difference in tone\u00a0\u00a0\nbetween the two matte like colors I need something\u00a0\nto be significantly darker to be really appealing\u00a0\u00a0\nto me because I love a good quad I travel with\u00a0\nthe colourpop quads all of the time but those\u00a0\u00a0\nusually come with a really dark matter really\u00a0\ngood quality so for that reason they get to come\u00a0\u00a0\ntraveling with me because I really do enjoy them\u00a0\nthese are lacking a little bit of that but I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nloving the packaging the way that she was using\u00a0\nthat uh stripe packaging with a little I'm loving\u00a0\u00a0\nthe packaging loving the packaging loving the idea\u00a0\nnot loving the color selection for me but I know\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's a lot of people out there that definitely\u00a0\ndo not want the dark shadow in a quad so this\u00a0\u00a0\nmight be for you but it's not for me oh this one\u00a0\nreleased I think last week I also used this one\u00a0\u00a0\nin the video where I was trying out new makeup\u00a0\nand this is the new face palette by Ace Beauty\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is an ultimate sculpt face palette it says\u00a0\nthat it's limited edition I think that's because\u00a0\u00a0\nit is in a subscription box and they have a couple\u00a0\nleft on their site I'm fairly sure that if a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nof people are loving this and I'm really enjoying\u00a0\nmine I'm sure that they will be able to bring it\u00a0\u00a0\nback somehow we just have to like let them know\u00a0\nactually in this picture here that you're seeing\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is uh in the upper corner that is Nia which\u00a0\nis the owner of Ace Beauty the owner and founder\u00a0\u00a0\nand then in the bottom corner is Adriana which is\u00a0\nthe brand manager at um Ace Beauty I thought it\u00a0\u00a0\nwas really fun that they were using uh themselves\u00a0\ntwo of the the founder and one of the employees as\u00a0\u00a0\nlike models for this little counter quad like I\u00a0\nsaid I've really been enjoying this I think the\u00a0\u00a0\nformula is really nice and I feel like if nothing\u00a0\nelse I really hope that they see that they were\u00a0\u00a0\nable to do a good formula and maybe they can bring\u00a0\nit back and Duels or maybe in another format or\u00a0\u00a0\nsingles in the future because I really do like\u00a0\nthe formula I think that one is really nice and\u00a0\u00a0\nthe undertones as well these are per usual from\u00a0\nflores's Cosmetics beautiful releases these are\u00a0\u00a0\ntwo highlighters the twin Lotus luminous glow this\u00a0\nis an Innovative liquid to baked formula which\u00a0\u00a0\nsounds amazing that harmonizes the Natural Glow of\u00a0\nliquid with the brilliant Luminosity of powder I\u00a0\u00a0\nreally like the formulas of fluorescence I feel\u00a0\nlike they have a I feel like they're formulas\u00a0\u00a0\nare very reminiscent of what I feel formulas\u00a0\nare in like really high-end or luxury Brands I\u00a0\u00a0\nI think these look beautiful that pinky one do you\u00a0\nwant to get that one quartz glow and Amber glow\u00a0\u00a0\nit's not a pink with a gold Sheen I feel like\u00a0\nit could be I might be intrigued by that one\nI'm putting that in my maybe pile I might\u00a0\nwant to get that one I will link it down\u00a0\u00a0\nbelow in case you are interested they do ship\u00a0\ninternationally if that is something that\u00a0\u00a0\nyou're intrigued by oh this is something that\u00a0\nI think I'm gonna be trying is this available\u00a0\u00a0\nEclipse matte setting spray by milk makeup\u00a0\nand a bunch of you were also telling me that\u00a0\u00a0\nI really should try out that matte primer\u00a0\nfrom milk so I think I will be trying out\u00a0\u00a0\nboth of those the matte primer and the matte\u00a0\nsetting spray the bottle beautiful this is a\u00a0\u00a0\nlocks on makeup for up to 16 hours help blur\u00a0\npores and controls Shine for soft focus finish\u00a0\u00a0\nsprays evenly listen nobody likes an attacking\u00a0\nsprayer sits quickly non-drying non-sticky\ncoming soon to their website in\u00a0\nretailers yeah I think I will be\u00a0\u00a0\ntrying this one and the primer once\u00a0\nI see it launch because honestly\ncould be convinced this is so funny and I got\u00a0\ntagged in this one and I know exactly why I got\u00a0\u00a0\ntagged in this one because this is actually the\u00a0\nbomb when did you hear about the bomb as of late\u00a0\u00a0\nit's been a while right but they're\u00a0\nreleasing two new shades of their\u00a0\u00a0\nstaniac lip cheek stain homecoming\u00a0\nqueen and prom queen these are\u00a0\u00a0\nfirst of all one of them is an orange these\u00a0\nlook really cool I kind of want to try that\u00a0\u00a0\norange if it leaves an orange tint that\u00a0\nhomecoming queen it is already available\nI feel like I'm doing a Theresa is dead and\u00a0\njust shopping throughout the episode I'll buy\u00a0\u00a0\nit afterwards but I think I'm gonna buy that\u00a0\norange one because I really want to try that\u00a0\u00a0\nand I have been really enjoying stains\u00a0\nlip liners stain and then lip oil on top\u00a0\u00a0\nthat is one of my favorite combos for like\u00a0\nnon-filming days here's another product\u00a0\u00a0\nthat was very easy for me to say no to and\u00a0\nthis is the made by Mitchell blurs blush\u00a0\u00a0\npressed disco palette it says it's\u00a0\nfinally here exclamation point again\nwho's who's here screaming in caps lock I don't\u00a0\nknow this is a one stop to all your favorite\u00a0\u00a0\nsold out blur blush pressed with a new additions\u00a0\nand leave overfilling your makeup kit behind so\u00a0\u00a0\nhere's the thing this this is not for you and\u00a0\nme unless you are working makeup artist but if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou're like me and you're just doing your makeup\u00a0\non yourself and at most your friends from the\u00a0\u00a0\ncomfort of your own home if you're not a working\u00a0\nmakeup artist you do not need to buy one of these\u00a0\u00a0\nextremely large pretty redundant blush\u00a0\npalettes so these are 12 different blush shades\u00a0\u00a0\nyou don't need a 12 pan blush palette especially\u00a0\nnot when one side is this similar as these are\u00a0\u00a0\nyou just really really do not need that just buy\u00a0\nthe blush that you want and honestly I've tried\u00a0\u00a0\nthis formula it's nice but nothing more that's\u00a0\nwhat I'm gonna say about this formula it's nice\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I'm not it's not my favorite formula in the\u00a0\nworld it doesn't like 100 like melt in the skin\u00a0\u00a0\nit's not effortless it's fine but the packaging\u00a0\nis hideous the packaging is hideous but if you\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to try it buy one don't buy a 12 pan blush\u00a0\npalette unless you're working makeup artist and\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is the only blush that you want to have\u00a0\nin your kit because 12 blush is all at once\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's a lot MAC Cosmetics is coming out with\u00a0\nthe pearlescence Ramadan collection and this\u00a0\u00a0\nis an eyeshadow palette it is an extra Dimension\u00a0\nTrio it's lipsticks and lip liners gel liners and\u00a0\u00a0\nthe fix plus I've heard that Mac is the biggest\u00a0\nif not like one of the biggest makeup brands in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Middle East that that's the place where they\u00a0\nare doing the absolute absolute best that and in\u00a0\u00a0\nAsian markets so it makes sense for them to do\u00a0\na Ramadan collection and I honestly really think\u00a0\u00a0\nthis pearlescent like packaging with the gold\u00a0\nprint absolutely stunning that eyeshadow palette\u00a0\u00a0\nit's nothing that I need but honestly I think it\u00a0\nall looks pretty cool and if you are celebrating\u00a0\u00a0\nRamadan maybe it's really cool for you to know\u00a0\nthat there is a Ramadan inspired makeup collection\u00a0\u00a0\nout there and maybe you'll be interested I will\u00a0\ntry and see if I can find it and I will link it\u00a0\u00a0\ndown below let's end with another fragrance and\u00a0\nthis is from Seoul de chanero and this is the Rio\u00a0\u00a0\nRadiance so this is one of their body sprays\u00a0\nI have one of their body sprays and it is so\u00a0\u00a0\nwonderful it's definitely one of those like if you\u00a0\nare going straight from the beach maybe to a lunch\u00a0\u00a0\nrestaurant that's the perfect like spritzer or if\u00a0\nyou like going on a lunch during a warm summer day\u00a0\u00a0\nit's absolutely beautiful this is solar tuberose\u00a0\nand lace the cocoa oh so it's coconut milk and\u00a0\u00a0\nsolar tuberose it's a perfume Mist this is perfume\u00a0\nmist and not body mist so maybe this is a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit more potent than a normal body mist it\u00a0\nis coming soon and to of course I'm guessing\u00a0\u00a0\nSephora honestly if you're into coconuts I'm I'm\u00a0\nsure that this is going to be like very uh lactal\u00a0\u00a0\nfragrance with a hint of coconut and probably the\u00a0\nsolar tuberose which I'm fairly sure is a very\u00a0\u00a0\nfloral scent again any kind of florals tropical\u00a0\nflorals non-tropical florals it's usually not my\u00a0\u00a0\nvibe but if it it's leaning very tropical I can\u00a0\nbe convinced I will say though that I love the\u00a0\u00a0\nother powder spray that I have from them and I'm\u00a0\nactually looking forward to getting into some of\u00a0\u00a0\nthose really hot and humid months where I can\u00a0\njust dose myself in that one again like today\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm looking out the window and it's like gray and\u00a0\nit's been raining tonight it's not the perfect day\u00a0\u00a0\nfor a solutionary body spray but I know give me\u00a0\ntwo months and I will be loving that one so yeah\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's the one I wanted to end with I do have a\u00a0\ndog that's sleeping here next to me let's see so I\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't accidentally run him over I hope you enjoyed\u00a0\nthis episode please let me know what you think\u00a0\u00a0\ndown below I would love to hear your opinions\u00a0\nif you're

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

Diese Dinger sind ja extra so konzipiert, dass sie die Haut reizen und damit die Lippen aufplustern. Ich glaube teilweise ist da auch so Chili, Pfefferminz und sowas drin. Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

I\u00a0\nthink it would give you a very similar effect\u00a0\u00a0\nmoving on next shade we have here is heart\u00a0\nof gold this is a shimmery pale peach pink\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't even know what color I want to do\u00a0\ntoday maybe I'll do my eyeshadow first and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen we can pick the best one to go with it\u00a0\nthis just judging off the outside color man\u00a0\u00a0\nbright pink I think I could do a couple a couple\u00a0\ndifferent colors on my cheeks today this one's\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a darker peachy Pink by the looks of it oh my\u00a0\ngosh that would be stunning on darker skin tones\u00a0\u00a0\ntoo and let's look at the highlighters real quick\u00a0\nbecause I did open just one to like have a little\u00a0\u00a0\nsneak peek this is called making memories it looks\u00a0\nreally okay I've been saying about how I'm not a\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlighted girl right now I don't know why but\u00a0\nalso when I saw this it reignited something in me\u00a0\u00a0\nI will Swatch all of these as the time comes when\u00a0\nwe apply but so cool it's so bright obviously you\u00a0\u00a0\nwould apply a very small amount but it's literally\u00a0\nlike a white highlighter and surprisingly I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nthink that's like a very common color I just\u00a0\nreally want oh I just want to look at all of\u00a0\u00a0\nthem in my feels it's like lilac oh my God my\u00a0\nbase right now my brows I hope I can like pull\u00a0\u00a0\ntogether a decent makeup look today because I'm\u00a0\njust looking crusty sweetheart is that a blush no\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's a blush this is a highlighter the heart of\u00a0\ngold is a highlighter I thought it was a blush oh\u00a0\u00a0\nmy God it is I thought it was just shimmery okay\u00a0\nI need to calm down this this is so pretty that\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor that's a very like K Beauty kind of color\u00a0\nI have some like K Beauty blushes in that kind of\u00a0\u00a0\ntone I don't know it's like very pastel you're\u00a0\nglowing this is like a golden pale golden like\u00a0\u00a0\nI said we will Swatch them all should have done\u00a0\nit now I'll do it later in the video Love Struck\u00a0\u00a0\nwhy am I throwing things it's like a very\u00a0\npeachy pinky pale neutrally Vibe where did\u00a0\u00a0\nI put the eyeshadow palette how do I lose an\u00a0\neyeshadow it's like a little book wow bright\u00a0\u00a0\npinks and reds I found my brushes I don't know\u00a0\nwhat I'm doing today I don't know I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nstart with Head Over Heels which is like a pale\u00a0\nwhitey pinky color yeah you can barely see that\u00a0\u00a0\nit's probably more of like a highlighty shade\u00a0\nlike brow bone but I'm gonna kind of put it\u00a0\u00a0\nthrough the crease just to like sit the concealer\u00a0\nI've got there because it's creasing in the crease\nand just to try and smooth out the area hopefully\u00a0\nthe darker colors will blend nicely on top of this\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm going to take talk to me it's got little\u00a0\nGlitters in it but I think it'll be subtle\u00a0\u00a0\nonce we use a blending brush I'm just going to\u00a0\nadd that through the crease you know when your\u00a0\u00a0\nbase just feels so crusty that like nothing Blends\u00a0\non top of it well I feel like that but it's still\u00a0\u00a0\ndoing a good job so that's good this brush is a\u00a0\nSephora blending brush it doesn't actually have\u00a0\u00a0\na name does it oh no tapered crease it does it's\u00a0\njust really hard to read this color is really nice\u00a0\u00a0\nfor a pink like it's almost like slightly cool\u00a0\ntone I'm going to take a little bit of your fave\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'm going to pop that on the outer part\u00a0\nof the lid and crease like outer Corner color\u00a0\u00a0\nI think I will use like a p Louise base just to\u00a0\ncarve out some shape in this Stone just keeping\u00a0\u00a0\nthis very Blended that color is stunning\u00a0\nalso very pigmented but still easy to blend\u00a0\u00a0\nlook at that I'm hoping I can use the\u00a0\nblushes to kind of blend into this\u00a0\u00a0\narea later so it's not so like harsh my skin just\u00a0\nfeels so dry I wish I could use some seeing spray\u00a0\u00a0\nright now but it goes against what I believe\u00a0\nin for my first impressions I'm going to use\u00a0\u00a0\nsome of this Base called is it called extra\u00a0\nspicy it's like a pale pink and we're going\u00a0\u00a0\nto do some like 2015 makeup or like 2016 I guess\u00a0\nI don't know I can't remember this is a pay Louise\u00a0\u00a0\nbrush I'll put my discount code for p Louise\u00a0\ndown below okay going back in with your fave\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm choosing a eyeshadow brush bikes with\u00a0\nbeauty I'm going to apply that to the edge\nI'm gonna do a wing shape just because I love that\u00a0\ncolor so much I just want a bit more of it on the\u00a0\u00a0\non the eye just tapping my blending brush over it\u00a0\njust to soften any harsh lines and then oh I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nknow what color I want to use I might take cuddle\u00a0\nup mixed with be mine and then add that to the\u00a0\u00a0\nnext pattern if that makes any sense at all\nat the middle of my eyelid I haven't done a really\u00a0\nlike bright eye in a little while on my YouTube\u00a0\u00a0\nchannel like this I'm kind of stoked about it\u00a0\nand then I think I'm gonna mix like onto the\u00a0\u00a0\nbrush and take a little bit of that color just my\u00a0\ntype it's like a shimmery white color for the very\u00a0\u00a0\nand a pot of the lid\nthat hits the spot\nwell I ever get to an age where I just\u00a0\noutgrow this kind of makeup I don't know\u00a0\u00a0\nI feel like I'm really excited for the elderly\u00a0\npeople like of my generation like Millennials\u00a0\u00a0\nand then like what's under ashgnz are they under\u00a0\nus or are they too under us I don't even know but\u00a0\u00a0\nall these directions to be old people I feel\u00a0\nlike we're gonna be like the coolest looking\u00a0\u00a0\nold people ever wrinkly with tattoos and\u00a0\ncrazy makeup and crazy colorful hair and\u00a0\u00a0\ncrazy fashion and just all of it I'm using\u00a0\nwhatever's left on my brush or my brow bone\u00a0\u00a0\nI love it I love before I do any\u00a0\neyeliner and stuff where are these little\u00a0\u00a0\nthingies I wanna see what these are all about\u00a0\nthe Cutie Marks by colourpop you know I should\u00a0\u00a0\nactually check that this collection is available\u00a0\nstill like I mean I've got no doubt in my mind\u00a0\u00a0\nexcept the little little tiny doubt in my mind\u00a0\nokay the eyeshadow palette is currently out of\u00a0\u00a0\nstock lots of the blushes are still available\u00a0\nor you can buy like all of them at once there\u00a0\u00a0\nis an option to sign up for emails so for when\u00a0\nthey launch so I'm assuming they're coming back\u00a0\u00a0\nand being restart so hopefully by the time you\u00a0\nsee this video they're restocked but either way\u00a0\u00a0\nit's just a bit of fun it's a bit of fun to try\u00a0\nout whoops all of this makeup and even if you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan't get the collection hopefully if you like\u00a0\nthis look you can recreate it with something\u00a0\u00a0\nthat you already own I mean it's always good\u00a0\nif you can just recreate any look with stuff\u00a0\u00a0\nyou're already on because that's better isn't\u00a0\nit this is pink heart so it's like a little pink\u00a0\u00a0\nstamp let's Swatch it oh cute or we've got red\u00a0\nheart also really cute oh the red might be cute\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna wait until I do my lips because then\u00a0\nI can like you know I don't know if I'm doing\u00a0\u00a0\nred lips or pink lips or what so I'm just going\u00a0\nto leave the eyes there for now let's do some\u00a0\u00a0\nbronzer let's use another colourpop one this\u00a0\nis I'll bet I get it but it's about like this\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm using this Laura Lee L 34 brush I really like\u00a0\nthis brush tip tip tip oh my God look at my skin\nthis might be not a positive review on this\u00a0\nfoundation and I'm not stoked about it because it\u00a0\u00a0\ncost me like 70 dollars just tapping some of that\u00a0\non the kind of cheek cheekbone General vicinity\u00a0\u00a0\nwe need some down the nose it's a really\u00a0\nnice color on my skin tone it's quite subtle\u00a0\u00a0\nthis gives a nice little hint of a bronze there's\u00a0\nso much going right with this makeup look it's so\u00a0\u00a0\nmuch going wrong we're just going to like\u00a0\nblur our eyes a little bit and just like\u00a0\u00a0\nlook from a distance and not look too close oh man\u00a0\nI don't know what blush and everything I want to\u00a0\u00a0\ndo okay let's look at the lips first options we've\u00a0\ngot the lip scrub and lip balm I don't really need\u00a0\u00a0\na lip scrub right now believe it or not so let's\u00a0\njust not worry about that I've got three glowing\u00a0\u00a0\nlip colors swipe on three kiss worthy Hues of\u00a0\nour comfy glowy formula infused with plant-based\u00a0\u00a0\nButters vegan collagen for a hydrating boost and\u00a0\na fuller looking pout Candy Kisses that color I\u00a0\u00a0\nwill Swatch it oh pretty the formula feels nice\u00a0\nthat color actually would look really nice red\u00a0\u00a0\nhot which surprise surprise is a red color it's\u00a0\nactually a very muted red though it's not too\u00a0\u00a0\nbright and crazy that would also look really\u00a0\ngood with this makeup look and then last but\u00a0\u00a0\nnot least oh this looks very pretty this one is\u00a0\ncalled tickled pink is that cherry I don't know\u00a0\u00a0\neither way pretty we do need a little\u00a0\npencil though this is she Glam 525\nand I don't know I'm thinking maybe the middle\u00a0\u00a0\none so not red not pale pink\u00a0\njust something in the middle\nyou know what though the color is like a\u00a0\ntinty kind of vibe it's like a lip glossy\u00a0\u00a0\ntint it feels creamy it feels like a creamy\u00a0\nlipstick but looks super creamy what am I\u00a0\u00a0\neven saying I don't know they feel really\u00a0\ngood I'm gonna add a little bit of red too\nno don't like that Regrets by the way all my Tick\u00a0\nTock I have been doing this little mini series\u00a0\u00a0\nwhere I just do a random lip combo and it's been\u00a0\nreally fun so go check it out I just randomly shut\u00a0\u00a0\nmy eyes grab random colors Chuck them on my lips\u00a0\nit's so fun because I've got so many lipsticks and\u00a0\u00a0\nit's a good way to like use new ones and some of\u00a0\nthe combos are a bit weird I'm gonna do the pink\nlet me commit on this side\noh you can barely see it\nit's cute it's not super in your face\u00a0\u00a0\noh I just did one upside down why am I actually\u00a0\nso dumb whatever well pretend it was on purpose\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm just concealing The Edge because I got\u00a0\na little bit of the like stamp on my skin\nThat was supposed to be how it was gonna look it\u00a0\nwas on purpose it's creative now for the blush I\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel like I want to use these two because one of\u00a0\nthem's like quite lilac I'm curious to see how it\u00a0\u00a0\nlooks on my skin tone this one's like super bright\u00a0\npink but would go so well with the eye makeup I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna say this big huge Laura Mercier brush to\u00a0\nhopefully diffuse the color so first we're going\u00a0\u00a0\ninto hot to touch I'll Swatch it on my hand s it's\u00a0\nnot super super pigmented in a good way you know\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it's it's wearable and then the other one\u00a0\nwe're going to use is Cupid's bow which is that\u00a0\u00a0\none underneath and then I'll Swatch woo me very\u00a0\nvery pretty that one looks so pretty this one's\u00a0\u00a0\nso pretty too though sweetheart do I want to use\u00a0\nsweetheart maybe yeah I feel like I really want\u00a0\u00a0\nto use sweetheart I might use sweetheart and hot\u00a0\nto touch and we'll use Cupid's bar another time\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich is like lilac so hot to touch first\u00a0\nI'm just going to dust it on my cheekbone\nand I'm gonna connect it\u00a0\nup to the eyeshadow kind of\nit's very pretty it gives a similar effect like\u00a0\nI said to those Dior blushes like the undertone\u00a0\u00a0\nof it is very similar and then this one's more\u00a0\npastel sweetheart and it adds some more kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nalmost on the apples and I'm going to\u00a0\nsweep a little bit closer to under my eyes\u00a0\u00a0\njust to try and blend it all together this\u00a0\nwould be very good if you love The Pink under\u00a0\u00a0\neye trained I think I need to try that still\u00a0\nand I think I'd probably use this like I think\u00a0\u00a0\nit's a perfect color we're not going to do it\u00a0\ntoday though every single one of these going\u00a0\u00a0\nstraight in my drawer I love them all I mean I\u00a0\nhaven't even tried them all but I just love to\u00a0\u00a0\nlook at them okay highlighters I'm gonna Swatch\u00a0\nthem so Heart of Gold is this like Peach which\u00a0\u00a0\nis this one just here it's so so nice they would\u00a0\nactually look good today because it's like pinky\u00a0\u00a0\nPeach you know the way of it you're glowing\u00a0\nit's like a golden color that one there kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof more similar to stuff I've already got this\u00a0\nis one that could look good today as well it's\u00a0\u00a0\ncalled in my feelings lilacy pinky takes me\u00a0\nback to like 2015 BH Cosmetics um highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\npalettes we already swatched making memories this\u00a0\ntop one and then we also have Lovestruck or maybe\u00a0\u00a0\nthis will be for today pale pinky milky kind of\u00a0\nhighlight color it's on the very bottom there\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah maybe let's do that one if my base looked\u00a0\nFlawless right now this would just be magnificent\nI'm using a little bit of Birdie\u00a0\nlip pencil which is by colourpop\nI'm going to curl my lashes\nwhich I never normally do but I've started trying\u00a0\nto make the effect because I see girls on Tick\u00a0\u00a0\nTock curling their lashes all the time and I'm\u00a0\nlike it looks so much better dude this one is a\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup cake one rest in peace that's where my eye\u00a0\nshape's so weird too I can never do it properly\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'm also like really scared that one\u00a0\nday I'll like disconnect it and I'll just be\u00a0\u00a0\nbold like I'll just cut them I'm gonna use this\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle sample this is the Charlotte\u00a0\nTilbury Pillow Talk push-up lashes\u00a0\u00a0\nnow I've been taking care of my lashes like you\u00a0\ndon't even understand do you remember like I was\u00a0\u00a0\nprobably three or four months postpartum and I was\u00a0\nsaying about how all of my lashes were so short\u00a0\u00a0\nlike they'd never been shorter and a lot of people\u00a0\nsaid they experienced something similar postpartum\u00a0\u00a0\nI have been using some cool stuff which you guys\u00a0\nwill find out about soon and like my lashes are\u00a0\u00a0\nunreal obviously they look even better now because\u00a0\nthey're curled but they're like so so long I'm\u00a0\u00a0\njust gonna let that dry and then we can wipe\u00a0\nit away with a Q-tip hopefully oh I need a curl\nall right we are done the mascara was a little\u00a0\nbit of a mission to remove but I did my best job\u00a0\u00a0\nand here we have the makeup okay I really like\u00a0\nthis collection hopefully you guys can get your\u00a0\u00a0\nhands on it or maybe you already did otherwise\u00a0\nyeah keep an eye out on their website sign up\u00a0\u00a0\nfor the restocks maybe I don't know recreate\u00a0\nthis with stuff you have if you can because\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is such a fun makeup look I would normally\u00a0\nalso put on at false lashes but I don't know I\u00a0\u00a0\njust don't feel like wearing false lashes today\u00a0\nso that is it do you feel like the mascara like\u00a0\u00a0\ndroops my lashes down a little bit like they\u00a0\ncurled out real nice and now they're just like\u00a0\u00a0\ndown yeah even if you know you're not\u00a0\ninterested in this collection I hope\u00a0\u00a0\nyou enjoyed watching this regardless I hope\u00a0\nit provided a little bit of entertainment\u00a0\u00a0\nfor a little bit and I will talk to\u00a0\nyou guys in my next video bye [Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

        "transcript_text": "Hello beautiful and welcome back to my channel\u00a0\nand welcome to this get ready with me I am going\u00a0\u00a0\nto do a full face of well new makeup some of\u00a0\nit is brand spanking new and so much just new\u00a0\u00a0\nto me but I have a lot of fun stuff I have\u00a0\nthe neguchi foundation I just got the sigma\u00a0\u00a0\nand Kristen Dominique brush set and I'm gonna\u00a0\nbe doing a look with the new rogue palette by\u00a0\u00a0\nfantasy Cosmetics I'm super excited I hope\u00a0\nthis is gonna be a really good look because\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna be wearing it for the rest of\u00a0\nthe day I'm filming this in the morning\u00a0\u00a0\nand if you haven't been it before do consider\u00a0\nsubscribing because I do upload quite a lot of\u00a0\u00a0\nvideos every week all about makeup and beauty and\u00a0\nI would love to see you in my next one thank you\nmy mushroom to start with is this primer this is\u00a0\nfrom opium Beauty and joy adenuga I think that\u00a0\u00a0\nis her name this is what she looks like I will\u00a0\nuh link her down below I just got sent this spr\u00a0\u00a0\nite I want to say yesterday and this is like\u00a0\nlet me show you what it looks like it's like\u00a0\u00a0\na primer that has a little bit of a glow to\u00a0\nit uh so not like glittery but like it gives\u00a0\u00a0\na little warmth and just makes your skin\u00a0\nlook moisturized and I thought because I\u00a0\u00a0\ntried it on my hand and it looked really\u00a0\nnice and I mean I am trying a foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nsmells a little florally I am trying a\u00a0\nfoundation for the very first time today\u00a0\u00a0\nand of course I mean I'm gonna have to try\u00a0\nit without primer and with my normal primers\u00a0\u00a0\nin the future but I can still give you\u00a0\nlike some thoughts of how I feel about it\nit's like gel like that's\u00a0\nhow the primer feels gel like\u00a0\u00a0\nand I have very I don't have like sensitive skin\u00a0\nbut my skin is reactive if I touch it it turns red\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know why I got that one but I don't have\u00a0\nsensitive skin but I think it looks like really\u00a0\u00a0\nglowy and beautiful and it's not greasy it just\u00a0\nfeels moisturized let me zoom in and we can start\u00a0\u00a0\nwith the foundation because I have the new Gucci\u00a0\nFoundation actually let's open this one first the\u00a0\u00a0\nsigma Beauty and Kristen Dominique because I\u00a0\ndon't know exactly what kind of brushes are\u00a0\u00a0\nincluded I did with a sponge but this is setting\u00a0\npowder this is grinding and bake oh that looks\u00a0\u00a0\nreally nice I have a new powder to try as well\u00a0\ntoday so that could be fun this is a face contour\u00a0\u00a0\noh I don't like face I don't like face brushes\u00a0\nthat have this long bristles and still are this\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't think this is going to be my favorite\u00a0\nwe all have different preferences when it comes\u00a0\u00a0\nto brushes so there are six brushes\u00a0\nand the last one is a angled cheek\u00a0\u00a0\nand then it's an all-over position I love a\u00a0\nbrush like this though because it is super\u00a0\u00a0\nflimsy these are really nice for like glowy face\u00a0\npowders and then there is a eye and nose Contour\nI don't feel like I'm skilled enough for this I\u00a0\ndon't do nose Contour it's eye Contour here then\nI don't think this is going to be here but\u00a0\nthere's no foundation brush so we are going\u00a0\u00a0\nto be using a sponge with the foundation\u00a0\nthat's all I wanted to say so I did buy the\u00a0\u00a0\nnew Gucci Foundation still can't pronounce\u00a0\nit it is the eternity eternity the beauty I\u00a0\u00a0\nbought it Sephora and if you watch my Vlogs\u00a0\nif you don't watch my Vlogs maybe you should\u00a0\u00a0\nso my Vlog channel is linked down below I did buy\u00a0\nthis one in I think 240 W which was way too light\u00a0\u00a0\nit was a light to medium with the worm undertone\u00a0\nbut it was way too light and I saw my friend Karen\u00a0\u00a0\nHarris also tried to buy her shade and got a shade\u00a0\nit was way too light so maybe try a smidge up in\u00a0\u00a0\nShades if you're buying it online like me so now\u00a0\nI got 270 n medium fat and I did actually go to\nI mean I do have self tanner on\u00a0\nmy hand but like I would like my\nI'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna get my beauty Guru\u00a0\nstatus redacted because like I cannot even Mash\u00a0\u00a0\nmyself when I'm in store but I think this is\u00a0\ncan you imagine how light the other one was then\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is like I said this is a light to\u00a0\nmedium just before they get into mediums\nokay I'm gonna make this work\u00a0\nif it's the last thing I do\u00a0\u00a0\nfamous last words so what I noticed when I\u00a0\nswatched this one is that it is definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nfull coverage but as you can see it dries down\u00a0\npretty quickly you can tell it dries down pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nquickly and it almost feels like a little thick\u00a0\nwhen I like when it dries down the way that it\u00a0\u00a0\nfelt on my hand it might feel totally different\u00a0\non my skin I mean that does look good but you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow how sometimes you Swatch something and it\u00a0\ndoesn't give you the the confidence like you don't\u00a0\u00a0\nhave a lot of confidence in the product that's\u00a0\nhow I felt about this one and I can't believe\u00a0\u00a0\nI mean my hands are darker but like this is not\u00a0\ngonna be a good summer shade for me because I\u00a0\u00a0\ndo tan pretty easily in the summer I mean you\u00a0\ncan watch last Summer's videos I did not have\u00a0\u00a0\nany self tanner whatsoever in last Summer's\u00a0\nvideos it was just me enjoying the outdoors\nI don't know about this shade range and it\u00a0\nalso smells very florally to the point where\u00a0\u00a0\nI Swatch it on my hand inside Sephora and I\u00a0\nwalked around and I told my husband I'm like\u00a0\u00a0\nsomeone is like spraying perfume and then I\u00a0\nnoticed no it's me it smelled so much that\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen I had my hand out here I could still smell\u00a0\nit on my hand and yeah it is very very fragrant\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich let's be honest luxury makeup usually is it\u00a0\ndoes look pretty good it dried down but not like\u00a0\u00a0\nsuper dry it could be the primer too more like\u00a0\na like you feel when you get like moisturized\u00a0\u00a0\nwith something that's more of a gel moisturizer\u00a0\nnot like a super thick or oily moisturizer I'm\u00a0\u00a0\njust going to add a little bit more here because\u00a0\nthis is usually where I need some coverage okay\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe it oxidizes a bit who knows maybe that will\u00a0\nsave me who knows it is a little thick to blend\u00a0\u00a0\nout though this is definitely not one of those\u00a0\nfoundations that just Blends effortlessly that's\u00a0\u00a0\nnot this one it blends with effort definitely with\u00a0\neffort just after putting it on it looks nice but\nI'm having second thoughts I'm gonna be using\u00a0\nthe quickie concealer I've heard some good\u00a0\u00a0\nthings about this I bought it in 40nn so I thought\u00a0\nI'll be using this one today I did Swatch this in\u00a0\u00a0\nstore and I thought it's watched really nice I\u00a0\nthink this will be a good concealer color I do\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a concealer that's a low brightening\u00a0\nbut this is a I'm pretty sure this was a\u00a0\u00a0\nthis oh my God there's something black under\u00a0\nhere I wonder what kind of claim they had here\u00a0\u00a0\nthat they had to cover up what do you think what\u00a0\ndo you think they had under here that they had\u00a0\u00a0\nto cover up because it's clear that something\u00a0\nlike nobody would put like a black square like\u00a0\u00a0\nthat underneath that is a major cover-up operation\u00a0\nin action but I'm fairly sure that this was also\u00a0\u00a0\ndescribed as a light medium but of course it is\u00a0\na little brightening I like putting some here I\u00a0\u00a0\nlike putting some here and I don't think I'm gonna\u00a0\nput anything anywhere else because I'm already a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle a little light I'm not going to be using\u00a0\nthis brush here I am going to be using my sponge\nthat must look really good I will\u00a0\nsay that's definitely full coverage\u00a0\u00a0\nand I think it Blended out really good\u00a0\nand I think that's a good shade for me\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm really actually enjoying how that's\u00a0\nlooking it's going to be very interesting\u00a0\u00a0\nhow all of this wears of course I do have I do\u00a0\nhave the new uh slate the bake blurring powders\u00a0\u00a0\nbut you are Cosmetics they come out I think\u00a0\nthese are the two shades that came out you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan't see the shades here but it is one that\u00a0\nis meant to be a translucent and then there\u00a0\u00a0\nis one that is meant to be a pink should I\u00a0\nbe trying the pink just for the sake of it\nokay let's open this up and let's see what we\u00a0\nget I'm just gonna pull some of the pink out\u00a0\u00a0\nand which brush was like a under eye face\u00a0\ncontour oh this one this was a brighten and baked\u00a0\u00a0\nokay I don't even have a pink undertone I\u00a0\nhave a well this is really picking up a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nof powder maybe this isn't the right brush for\u00a0\nme maybe it is more for like baking but I still\u00a0\u00a0\nheard people with my skin undertone that really\u00a0\nenjoy a pink powder because it really brightens\nhmm\nreally fine texture to the powder it really\u00a0\u00a0\ndid mattify the skin without\u00a0\nmaking it look super Shocky\nmaybe that's not horrible and I definitely don't\u00a0\nthink that there's a lot of pink tint to it it\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely didn't make my under eyes like pink\u00a0\nI will of course link all the things that I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nusing down below some of these things I got\u00a0\nin PR some of the things I bought myself like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe foundation and concealer I bought myself\u00a0\nI'm gonna use this other color a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nI think just around here my chin because I'm\u00a0\ngoing to use a cream bronzer these were sent\u00a0\u00a0\nin PR that I will put all of that down below and\u00a0\nI also will put links to the stuff in case you're\u00a0\u00a0\ninterested what Shades I'm using and also if I\u00a0\nhave any kind of discount codes because with some\u00a0\u00a0\nof these Brands I do be having some discount codes\u00a0\nand this I do bake around my nose because this is\u00a0\u00a0\nthe place where I get oily I will say I did notice\u00a0\nsome of the powder sticking a little weirdly\u00a0\u00a0\nto some spots so I'm gonna have to play\u00a0\nwith this a little bit more first impression\u00a0\u00a0\nthere was some like it was sticking to some\u00a0\nparts and just not wanting to blend out which\u00a0\u00a0\nI have never experienced with a powder before\u00a0\nunfortunately I didn't have the camera on when\u00a0\u00a0\nI was fixing it I didn't even think of it but yet\u00a0\nI'm gonna have to use this a little bit more and\u00a0\u00a0\nwe'll see how I feel let me actually use the uh\u00a0\ncream like bronzer ultimate sculpt palette so\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe this is more of a sculpting product before\u00a0\nI do my brows because I always do my brows off\u00a0\u00a0\ncamera because brows are boring so this is from\u00a0\nAce Beauty and this is the ultimate sculpt palette\u00a0\u00a0\nand they sent this one to me and they have a light\u00a0\nmedium a tan and a deep and I think that this is\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to be really really interesting maybe I'll\u00a0\ntry the face contour one and I'm gonna go in and\u00a0\u00a0\nthe one that's medium and then I might use a\u00a0\nlittle bit of the one that's light as well but\u00a0\u00a0\nsince my face is a smidge to light compared to my\u00a0\nbody I don't think it will be the worst of ideas\u00a0\u00a0\nif I warm up my face just a little bit this one is\u00a0\navailable on their website right now and I do have\u00a0\u00a0\na code with aspk as well I will put it down below\u00a0\nin case you want to save some money this actually\u00a0\u00a0\ngoes on super beautifully Blends out very\u00a0\neasily you can build on it you can Shear it out\u00a0\u00a0\nhmm I kind of like it and you know I'm not the\u00a0\nbiggest fan of a face palette but at least this\u00a0\u00a0\nis a quad and I understand for in the brand\u00a0\nsometimes it's really expensive to put out\u00a0\u00a0\nuh like singles it's not always doable for\u00a0\na Indie brand I'm going to take a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nof this lighter one and just warm up on top\u00a0\nhere but at least the quad is a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\neasier to store and to use according to me and\u00a0\neven to this because I have some power on this\u00a0\u00a0\nEdge but this is not really lifting it and\u00a0\nit's not looking weird it's actually looking\npretty impressive okay okay I approve\u00a0\nokay I used a little bit of my tarte lip\u00a0\u00a0\nliner this one is the maracusha juicy lip\u00a0\nliner in soft paint because I just wanted\u00a0\u00a0\nto line my lips a little bit because I'm\u00a0\ngoing to put on the lipstick before we do\u00a0\u00a0\num blush and highlighter but I feel like I\u00a0\naccidentally got some foundation on my lips\u00a0\u00a0\nand it's not my Jive I'm gonna be using one of\u00a0\nthis queen Lucia lipsticks Muse musia yes Musial\u00a0\u00a0\nlipsticks if you are again on my Vlog Channel\u00a0\nyou know that I brought one of these to LA and\u00a0\u00a0\nlook at this looks a little bit like a vibrator\u00a0\nmaybe a little bit of an aggressive aggressive\u00a0\u00a0\non vibrator but this like pastel mint swirly it's\u00a0\nso cool and then I'm gonna try a new color with\u00a0\u00a0\nyou today this is like a pinky Peach and it\u00a0\nis called Dorian so this is a matte lipstick\nor maybe more like a satin\nthis is not normally the kind of color I go for\u00a0\nmaybe I'll go over it with a gloss I just want\u00a0\u00a0\nto try a new color I really like the formula\u00a0\nand I love the packaging but I think some of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe colors are more like classic lipstick colors\u00a0\nand I like something that's a little bit more on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe brownie nude or the orangey side but maybe\u00a0\nthat is actually I don't I don't mind that so\u00a0\u00a0\nI have two products that are new that I want to\u00a0\ntry one is new to me because I got a PR package\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom Kasha Beauty so this is the moochi glow\u00a0\nbounce blendable highlighters I have that one\u00a0\u00a0\nbut first we are going to be applying this blush\u00a0\nthat I bought and this is in Bellini this is the\u00a0\u00a0\nyummy skin blurring balm powder flushed so this\u00a0\nis the bomb from Vanessa myricks but in like a\u00a0\u00a0\nblush format and I really like the uh this bomb\u00a0\nthing for my skin I've told you that before so\u00a0\u00a0\nI got the Bellini one I thought this was going\u00a0\nto be more of a yellowy orange but it is more of\u00a0\u00a0\na corally orange so if I like this one I might\u00a0\nbuy the other oh it's really creamy and lovely\u00a0\u00a0\nI might buy the other orange shade as well I\u00a0\nhaven't used any powder on the outer part of\u00a0\u00a0\nmy face I've only used it under my eyes and\u00a0\naround my nose and a little bit on my chin\nokay it's definitely a buildable formula that goes\u00a0\non a little sheer which is something that I like\u00a0\u00a0\nI like a formula that is pigmented but I want\u00a0\nit to be sheer buildable I want to be able to\u00a0\u00a0\nbuild because some formulas are like so sheer but\u00a0\nnot buildable so all you can get is sheer and you\u00a0\u00a0\nstart to build it it just becomes greasy but this\u00a0\ndefinitely builds and I like that this also has\u00a0\u00a0\nI think the um same ingredient right yes this has\u00a0\nabsolite as well which is that ingredient that was\u00a0\u00a0\nactually invented in Sweden that is much better\u00a0\nthan any other ingredient in makeup at soaking up\u00a0\u00a0\nGrease oils so basically this is going to dry\u00a0\ndown to a powder I mean this I mean how oily\u00a0\u00a0\nare we on your skins I don't know about that but\u00a0\nif you're the kind of person that gets oily all\u00a0\u00a0\nover your face and you also want to enjoy a cream\u00a0\nblush formula this one might be for you because\u00a0\u00a0\nI notice a difference with absolite that looks\u00a0\nbeautiful and really matches with the lipstick\u00a0\u00a0\nand I think the lipstick really harmonizes with\u00a0\nthe face now that we got that coral on the cheeks\u00a0\u00a0\nI really like that okay let's dig into this one\u00a0\nfrom Kasha Beauty I really like the packaging of\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one it does look like a little moochie let's\u00a0\nbe honest do you pronounce it mochi moochie mochi\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm sure you're gonna correct\u00a0\nme down in the comments\nsir\nokay okay\num\nI think to see here nothing\nlet me wiped that on my pants oh my god there\u00a0\nare like little specks everywhere this is a putty\u00a0\u00a0\num formula um so I'm gonna use the kind\u00a0\nof brush that I like for I'm afraid it's\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna fall off look at funky this one looks\u00a0\nnow this is a high cheekbone highlighter fo3\u00a0\u00a0\nby Sigma I like these for uh party\u00a0\nhighlighters I use them on the side\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know if I've been rough with this one\u00a0\nor why it fell out but clearly it had not been\u00a0\u00a0\nliving its best life so this is kind of similar\u00a0\nto the Super Shock formula by colourpop honestly\u00a0\u00a0\num this is a nicer packaging than the colourpop\u00a0\nones but this is not giving the same glow\u00a0\u00a0\nglow was the colourpop ones maybe mine is\u00a0\ndried out maybe that's why it fell out I\u00a0\u00a0\nmean I don't know like I got this in PR so I not\u00a0\n100 sure but I'm not overly impressed with this\u00a0\u00a0\nspecific product I like those cheek and lip\u00a0\ntints that they sent me I've been using those\u00a0\u00a0\nlip tints quite a lot I honestly really really\u00a0\nlike them they're so comfortable on the lips\u00a0\u00a0\nI mean this is nice but I think I\u00a0\nprefer the super shop ones and also\nso much highlighter here okay so the palette we're\u00a0\ngoing to be using today is the Rogue palette by\u00a0\u00a0\nfantasy cosmetica it looks like this and I think\u00a0\nthis is being released on the 1st of March 11 A.M\u00a0\u00a0\nCST I do have a cold with fantasy cosmetic as\u00a0\nwell it is Angelica which it is on most places\u00a0\u00a0\nI will put it down below in case you're interested\u00a0\nand I'm gonna put on some primer and I'm showing\u00a0\u00a0\nyou some swatches so you can see what it looks\u00a0\nlike this is my first impression of the palette\u00a0\u00a0\nand I am very intrigued to be trying this out I\u00a0\nfeel like fantasy cosmetica has for me and this\u00a0\u00a0\nis my opinion the last palette that they released\u00a0\nThe Bard palette I think was their best palette\u00a0\u00a0\nquality wise so far so I'm super intrigued to be\u00a0\nseeing what this one looks like because I love the\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor story oh before I forget there's also two\u00a0\nperfumes in this collection and these perfumes\u00a0\u00a0\nare only able to be shipped to Mainland us just\u00a0\nso you know but these are fumes made by fantasy\u00a0\u00a0\ncosmetica and I think they're made in-house and\u00a0\nthese bottles are hand painted and they come\u00a0\u00a0\nin these little pouches and I will say if you if\u00a0\nyou've seen some of my channel if you've seen me\u00a0\u00a0\ntalk about perfumes you know that I love perfumes\u00a0\nand I'm not a snob when it comes to perfumes but\u00a0\u00a0\nI have not had the best luck with Indie perfumes\u00a0\nsome of them have just straight up smell like a\u00a0\u00a0\nmoldy basement like you need to call an expert\u00a0\nbecause your market value is about to plummet\u00a0\u00a0\nthese immediately when I open them because this\u00a0\nis the Rogue one this is the purple one and the\u00a0\u00a0\nDruid one is the green one these honestly smell so\u00a0\nincredible I am so incredibly impressed by these\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Rogue one which is the one with the palette of\u00a0\ncourse it is so spicy it is so spicy and sexy and\u00a0\u00a0\nif you love a spicy scent like me this might be\u00a0\nfor you let me see if I can find the info about\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one oh here we are the Rogue one is a sweet\u00a0\nspiced Fruit Scent with a light floral notes I\u00a0\u00a0\ndo not feel any of the floral notes very light\u00a0\nundetectable I would say but it is incredibly\u00a0\u00a0\nSpicy Sweet spicy sexy it is if you love spicy\u00a0\nperfumes you will love these ones and these are\u00a0\u00a0\n16.99 ish for these like um like travel sprayers\u00a0\nand then the Druid one is a citrus and Pine\ngosh it is a citrus scent with a sweet\u00a0\nand Smoky wooden undertone inspired\u00a0\u00a0\nby Druids the Citrus is definitely a\u00a0\ntop note and it disappears with time\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is the one I'm smell I'm wearing today\u00a0\nand it reminds me a little bit of a prey is it\u00a0\u00a0\nEllis Brooklyn a prey but instead of the Juniper\u00a0\nthere is a citrus note to it but there is a very\u00a0\u00a0\nwarm Woody almost Herby like an herb forest pine\u00a0\nsituation that like lingers on the skin both very\u00a0\u00a0\npotent especially this one this one was on my\u00a0\nskin for 24 hours very very impressed with both\u00a0\u00a0\nof these so if you like perfumes and you live in\u00a0\nMainland us I would definitely recommend trying\u00a0\u00a0\nthem out because I was very very impressed\u00a0\num let's dig into this there's Blues here\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm gonna need none of you to judge me based on\u00a0\nme doing Blues so we're going to start with this\u00a0\u00a0\ndark one this is like a dark teal that's leaning\u00a0\nmore on the blue instead of the green and I am\u00a0\u00a0\nif you didn't know a big lover of Blues this\u00a0\nis called cunning I think fantasy cosmetica it\u00a0\u00a0\nis a fantasy inspired uh Indie brand I think that\u00a0\nthey mainly that's really pretty mainly base their\u00a0\u00a0\npalettes on like Dungeons or dragons and of course\u00a0\nA lot of these things because a lot of video games\u00a0\u00a0\ncome like inspired by Dungeons and Dragons and a\u00a0\nlot of these things you can find in games such as\u00a0\u00a0\nWorld of Warcraft that I play for example there\u00a0\nare a rogue class in World of Warcraft never\u00a0\u00a0\nplayed it myself though because they are squishy\u00a0\nLee and I do not do squishy Milly I can do squishy\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I'm I play Mage I can be squishy Mage and\u00a0\nbe in a distance actually oh my God my primer\u00a0\u00a0\ncreased a little bit because I was talking so long\u00a0\nabout the perfumes actually when I started World\u00a0\u00a0\nof Warcraft and I was gonna choose my character\u00a0\nI had someone help me choose because I'd never\u00a0\u00a0\nplayed the game I haven't really played any kind\u00a0\nof games like that before I'd only played more\u00a0\u00a0\nlike Diablo like Starcraft like more like strategy\u00a0\ngames like that so this person helped me picking\u00a0\u00a0\ncharacter and he was like do you want to be in\u00a0\nfront or in back I'm like I would like to be in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe back I would also like to this was before\u00a0\nmay just got time warp I would like to play a\u00a0\u00a0\nclass that is in the back I would like to be the\u00a0\nbackpack the backest of everyone I also would\u00a0\u00a0\nlike to not have an ability that people really\u00a0\nneed back in the days nobody needed Mages they\u00a0\u00a0\nwere just DPS so that if I die it doesn't really\u00a0\nmatter it's like just a DPS died nobody would like\u00a0\u00a0\na because back in the days if a shaman died it's\u00a0\nlike so who's doing who's doing bloodlust who's\u00a0\u00a0\ndoing heroism but that of course changed a little\u00a0\nbit and then of course a lot of boss fights came\u00a0\u00a0\nwhere you actually needed a mage for the ice\u00a0\nblock or remove curse or stuff like that but\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen I started playing you didn't need me just for\u00a0\nanything so that is how I picked my class and for\u00a0\u00a0\nthat reason I don't think I could ever play oh I'm\u00a0\nusing the stealth now I don't think I could ever\u00a0\u00a0\nplay Rogue because if you mess up you die in front\u00a0\nof everyone everyone can see you're in the front\u00a0\u00a0\nthe amount of Rogues that we have lost in boss\u00a0\nfights you know the boss fights there are like\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're on a platform and the Rogue is doing\u00a0\nthe backstabbing almost as many Rogues has\u00a0\u00a0\nbeen lost to the backstabbing of the platform\u00a0\nas to Hunters disengage is it really a boss\u00a0\u00a0\nfight if a hunter doesn't disengage off a\u00a0\nplatform I'll argue no I will say these work\u00a0\u00a0\nso well together I'm just blending out the edges\u00a0\na little bit of the dark blue again this looks\u00a0\u00a0\namazing I'm starting to put a little bit of eye\u00a0\nprimer under my eyes as well which honestly works\u00a0\u00a0\nout really good but the only thing wait let me\u00a0\nclean this one off the only thing that I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nlike about it is that I accidentally get it on my\u00a0\nlashes but you know win some lose some but let me\u00a0\u00a0\nget some of these colors under my eyes as well and\u00a0\nthen we can do the Shimmer I don't know I think I\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to do this one although you I think you can\u00a0\nsee here yeah it's clearly a purple to a blue\u00a0\u00a0\nI think you can see yeah but I still think I\u00a0\nwant to do that one so it is called slight of\u00a0\u00a0\nhand and I'm gonna pick it up on my brush picks\u00a0\nup pretty good looks really beautiful I am going\u00a0\u00a0\nto spray this because I have a matte under now\u00a0\nand I think that this is going to be more of\u00a0\u00a0\na Topper shade and I want to make sure that it's\u00a0\nnot like totally sliding off my my eye since this\u00a0\u00a0\nis gonna go over I'm just putting on a slight\u00a0\nlayer on top of my Shadows where these meet\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I like it to be matte heavy but I thought\u00a0\na little Shimmer here would be nice or you can\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely see oh there's a spec here you can\u00a0\ndefinitely see the purple right the purple go\u00a0\u00a0\ninto blue really really pretty but yeah I'm not\u00a0\nputting it all over my lid just where the light\u00a0\u00a0\nand the dark meet and then I'm Gonna Keep It\u00a0\nmatte I really like that I'm also going to be\u00a0\u00a0\nwearing because I got a pure package from Bright\u00a0\nlashes you know how much I've been talking about\u00a0\u00a0\nbright lashes I love love bright lashes and I\u00a0\nlove Angela bright who is the owner of bright\u00a0\u00a0\nlashes and she told me that they have released a\u00a0\nnew hot flash which is flirt and you know I love\u00a0\u00a0\nhalf lashes let me show you how these look and I\u00a0\nreally do love the half lashes by bright lashes\u00a0\u00a0\nand this is a new style that's called flirt oh\u00a0\nit's a little reflective so I'm gonna put this\u00a0\u00a0\none on on one eye and I'll put just mascara on\u00a0\nthe other so you can see the difference but yeah\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm so grateful that I was able to get some uh a\u00a0\nrestock of the ones that I love and also be able\u00a0\u00a0\nto try this new one so I'll come back with one\u00a0\neye completely done and you can see the difference\nyeah that is I'm I'm a big fan also of this\u00a0\npalette I think this is my favorite palette\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom fantasy cosmetica so far okay just a final\u00a0\nlook before I decide to put on the second lash\u00a0\u00a0\nbut this is with the Lash and this is without\u00a0\nlash it just gives a little lift at the outer\u00a0\u00a0\ncorner and I really like it and I like that this\u00a0\none is like longer and not it like in a little\u00a0\u00a0\ncluster and not so thick I really think that I\u00a0\nam gonna get it like along with this half lash\u00a0\u00a0\na lot really liking the duochrome effect of this\u00a0\nShadow it's so stunning this eye look I'm in love\u00a0\u00a0\nin love with this eye look okay let me finish up\u00a0\nand we can talk about my main favorites and the\u00a0\u00a0\nones that I'm a little indecisive about I gotta\u00a0\nsay I love this look I put on this blue shirt\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I was like you know what I'll do something\u00a0\nlow-key yes I told myself that with this palette I\u00a0\u00a0\nwas gonna do something low-key I love this look\u00a0\nI loved how these performed these were the best\u00a0\u00a0\nShadows from fantasy cosmetica that I've tried\u00a0\nso far I really really enjoyed this palette and I\u00a0\u00a0\nreally enjoy the perfumes and I will say every\u00a0\ntime I see a good in the band go from good to\u00a0\u00a0\nGreat it always makes me super excited because it\u00a0\nmakes me just be so excited for the journey that\u00a0\u00a0\nthey are gonna have so I'm very excited about this\u00a0\nI like everything that I use today I will say I\u00a0\u00a0\nhad some troubles with this powder just around\u00a0\nhere I'm gonna try it out again with another\u00a0\u00a0\nFoundation because I also will say this Foundation\u00a0\nwasn't effortless it wasn't super super easy to\u00a0\u00a0\nblend out and I talked to my friends on polo and\u00a0\nI told them this is one of those foundations that\u00a0\u00a0\nI mean technically it looks Flawless but it also\u00a0\nis like tethering on the line of being a little\u00a0\u00a0\ncakey and I think that has to do with that it\u00a0\nwasn't super easy to blend out so I feel like\u00a0\u00a0\nyou had to like put a little elbow grease into\u00a0\nblending it out and also you might end up getting\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit too much product where you might not\u00a0\nhave intended to because of it not just spreading\u00a0\u00a0\neffortlessly again this was the first time I'm\u00a0\ntrying it and this was the first time I'm trying\u00a0\u00a0\nit so I will of course be giving it another try\u00a0\nI really like the quickie wasn't super impressed\u00a0\u00a0\nwith the highlighter I really enjoyed the blush\u00a0\nI think I'm gonna buy this in another color\u00a0\u00a0\nI really really did enjoy this and the\u00a0\nlipstick I know that I like from before\u00a0\u00a0\nit is like a matte but it has a slides like satin\u00a0\nfinish to it it does dry down a little bit but it\u00a0\u00a0\ndoesn't feel crusty or dry on the lips it's very\u00a0\ncomfortable and it comes in a beautiful packaging\u00a0\u00a0\nand I really like this one is one I think this\u00a0\nhonestly looks really beautiful on the skin and\u00a0\u00a0\nso far the primer feels and looks really nice\u00a0\nas well again of course I'm gonna have to try\u00a0\u00a0\nthese products out with other things before I\u00a0\nreview them because a first impression is all\u00a0\u00a0\nfine and dandy but I always come back and I give\u00a0\nyou my final review once I've been able to try the\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct out a little bit more another thing that\u00a0\nin theory I like it but so far this brush set I\u00a0\u00a0\nlove the handles and I love the white bristles\u00a0\nbut none of the two shapes that I use today were\u00a0\u00a0\nperfect for what I like in face brushes and I feel\u00a0\nlike some of these they don't have exactly what\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm looking for in face brushes I am intrigued\u00a0\nto be trying this all over face Precision though\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I feel like this one could be a really\u00a0\nnice one but this only shows that we have so\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent ways of applying makeup because\u00a0\nKristen Dominique when she was able to pick\u00a0\u00a0\nout her favorite brushes or not even pick out like\u00a0\nthese are new non-existent since before brushes\u00a0\u00a0\nlike they created these together she picked out\u00a0\nher ideal shapes and they're not my ideal shapes\u00a0\u00a0\nand this only shows that we all have different\u00a0\npreferences when it comes to how we like applying\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup and how we like it to look and all of that\u00a0\nso even I think the quality of this seems perfect\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't think that these are perfect shapes for\u00a0\nhow I like to do my makeup and I think I mentioned\u00a0\u00a0\neverything that I talked about in today's video\u00a0\neverything will be down in the description box\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't forget to subscribe before you leave and I\u00a0\nwill see you again very soon in a new video bye\nthank you",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

Was mich definitiv interessieren w\u00fcrde w\u00e4ren gut reflektierende und nicht zu glitzerige Highlighter. Ich war nie ne Highlighter-Person und teste mich da gerade erst durch. Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde. Liebe Gr\u00fc\u00dfe",

Diese Dinger sind ja extra so konzipiert, dass sie die Haut reizen und damit die Lippen aufplustern. Ich glaube teilweise ist da auch so Chili, Pfefferminz und sowas drin. Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

women\u00a0\nowned and founded Brands there is a plethora I\u00a0\u00a0\ntried my absolute best to only feature the\u00a0\nbrands once in the video so only showcasing\u00a0\u00a0\none product I may own plethora of products from\u00a0\neach brand but I really want to showcase as much\u00a0\u00a0\nas possible quite a few of these things are both\u00a0\nnew and old whether I purchased them very recently\u00a0\u00a0\nor they've been sitting around just waiting for\u00a0\ntheir time to shine so I just hope that you guys\u00a0\u00a0\nare ready and excited I of course created\u00a0\nthis full face and I will have everything\u00a0\u00a0\nlisted and linked down below for you all going\u00a0\nfrom the tools because I did try out my first\u00a0\u00a0\nlash curler so I will have that down below all\u00a0\nthe way to the actual items that are physically\u00a0\u00a0\non my face if there's anything that I don't link\u00a0\ndown below that you're interested in just comment\u00a0\u00a0\ndown below and I will do do my best to link it um\u00a0\nand yeah I think that's it let's just get into it\nforeign hey guys so I am so excited\u00a0\nto come to you guys doing my first\u00a0\u00a0\nfull face of women-owned Brands now some\u00a0\nof these Brands I already have my whole\u00a0\u00a0\nbasket already separated so I'm very accomplished\u00a0\nabout that but some of these brands are actually\u00a0\u00a0\nstill women owned but they were women founded\u00a0\nso I felt so comfortable at least showcasing\u00a0\u00a0\nthese Brands because some of them have now since\u00a0\nsold and they're in like these huge big parent\u00a0\u00a0\ncompanies so I felt like I could still feature\u00a0\nthese Brands um and throughout the month as I did\u00a0\u00a0\nlast month with February being black history month\u00a0\nI will showcase more items that are women owned\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's so many women-owned Brands out there and\u00a0\nI'm just so excited to feature them showcase them\u00a0\u00a0\nbada bing bada boom so with that said like I said\u00a0\nso much to talk about let me just get everything\u00a0\u00a0\nout of its packaging because I am notorious\u00a0\nfor missing items because I can't see them\u00a0\u00a0\num so I'm just gonna put everything on my desk\u00a0\nvery quickly and we are going to begin so I\u00a0\u00a0\nactually didn't pull out a primer but I have one\u00a0\nthat I already have my opinions on but I'm just\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna feature it again this is from Merit and\u00a0\nthey sent me this product this is their great\u00a0\u00a0\nskin instant glow serum now I already showcased\u00a0\nthis at least once on my channel I believe I\u00a0\u00a0\ndidn't get around to reviewing it although I am\u00a0\nvery ready to review it this is a by official\u00a0\u00a0\nlayered product so there are two different layers\u00a0\nas by official um I always suggest shaking it up\u00a0\u00a0\ndo know though that because you've shaken it up\u00a0\nyou are gonna have just some slight seeping of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe product throughout the nozzle and in the top\u00a0\nso just prepared for that it is very very liquidy\u00a0\u00a0\nit's pretty much all like an oil based but I will\u00a0\nsay this is a really nice First Step it's not too\u00a0\u00a0\nmuch for my high combination skin and because I'm\u00a0\ngoing to be wearing this band today I'm not going\u00a0\u00a0\nto kind of do my whole forehead we're just gonna\u00a0\ndo kind of the important area if you will but so\u00a0\u00a0\nI definitely think this is a great kind of primer\u00a0\nfor those who have combination skin oily skin and\u00a0\u00a0\njust want a little bit of like Radiance Sheen\u00a0\nto the base it's not a lot like you can see it\u00a0\u00a0\npretty much looks on my skin just with a little\u00a0\nbit of oil on it but it really is more than just\u00a0\u00a0\noil and you can see that I found that this has\u00a0\nhelped me with some of my problem foundations\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I more recently have featured on my channel\u00a0\nthat just don't work on my skin because it just it\u00a0\u00a0\nsettles and it's just bad this has been the game\u00a0\nchanger so I'll talk more about that when I do my\u00a0\u00a0\nRoundup I'm already starting to collect products\u00a0\nfor that Roundup and I'm so so happy about that\u00a0\u00a0\nso previously Merit Beauty actually sent me a\u00a0\ndifferent shade but that one was just too dark\u00a0\u00a0\nfor me so I decided to use my own money I might\u00a0\nhave used my code or my link which is always down\u00a0\u00a0\nin the description box in case you care just to\u00a0\nget a shade that I thought was closer to my actual\u00a0\u00a0\nskin tone this is in the shade sepia and if I can\u00a0\nremember I will have on the screen the shade that\u00a0\u00a0\nthey previously sent to me it was just too dark so\u00a0\nwe're just gonna go ahead and Mark this and yeah\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is pretty much dead on for my skin tone the\u00a0\none thing that I would say when it comes to Merit\u00a0\u00a0\nthey are very much a like quick simple\u00a0\nfoundation and just brand overall so if\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's not your aesthetic I honestly would not\u00a0\nrecommend the brand but if it is your aesthetic\u00a0\u00a0\nthe brand is fantastic I have not had a problem\u00a0\nwith any of the products give me a second I just\u00a0\u00a0\ngotta find a brush actually this is perfect this\u00a0\nis a chico hoto um I think this is technically\u00a0\u00a0\na cheek brush but it it has the right density\u00a0\nfor what I need and I'm just going to blend out\u00a0\u00a0\nthis Foundation now in my opinion it does give\u00a0\na nice solid coverage I would say about medium\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich is the type of finish that I personally\u00a0\nenjoy so I am definitely enjoying this I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna add some more in the center I feel\u00a0\nlike I really got a lot of the foundation\u00a0\u00a0\non the perimeter of my face but maybe not\u00a0\nin this area and as you can see it really\u00a0\u00a0\njust looks like skin it's very very minimal\u00a0\nmakeup brand that I really really do enjoy\u00a0\u00a0\nas I mentioned I am affiliated with the brand\u00a0\nthey have sent me PR quite a few times now but\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is a product that I purchased for my own\u00a0\nmoney and I genuinely do enjoy the product and\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's why I bought it so yeah this is their\u00a0\nthe minimalist perfecting complexion stick\u00a0\u00a0\nbased on that name and based on the finish and\u00a0\nthe formulation I definitely would say if you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan find a shade that works for you for maybe even\u00a0\num bronzer or anything like that that works they\u00a0\u00a0\ndo have other products in their range that I do\u00a0\nenjoy as well but this is the one product that I\u00a0\u00a0\nwanted to feature in this video preemptively\u00a0\nI tried my best if possible to only feature\u00a0\u00a0\none product from the brands that I had available\u00a0\njust to make sure to kind of spread the wealth so\u00a0\u00a0\num yeah that was that but sometimes they may have\u00a0\nkind of overlapped between multiple products just\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause of the limitations that I had and this\u00a0\nwas all stuff that I pretty much already had\u00a0\u00a0\neither already purchased it or they were\u00a0\nalready in my collection so I already knew\u00a0\u00a0\nif I love them or not for concealer I'm actually\u00a0\ngoing to be featuring this baby this is the sigma\u00a0\u00a0\nBeauty bronzer Duo this is in dark to deep\u00a0\nokay I had to scoot in I think my camera just\u00a0\u00a0\ndidn't like how far away I was it's not an end-all\u00a0\nbe-all for me because I don't necessarily need the\u00a0\u00a0\ncorrecting aspect and I think that is the best\u00a0\npart of this particular product that said the\u00a0\u00a0\nbrand Sigma Beauty I feel is a really solid brand\u00a0\nI'm one of those people that I can definitely find\u00a0\u00a0\nand appreciate and enjoy a brand that is just\u00a0\nfull on solid this is that it is truly a great\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct and because of that it has stayed in my\u00a0\ncollection and it really works for these kind of\u00a0\u00a0\neffortless skin my skin but better days and that's\u00a0\nwhy it's in my current shop my stash because\u00a0\u00a0\nit works with the foundations that I have which\u00a0\nare more kind of skin tint type of situations so\u00a0\u00a0\nI really enjoy this product but at the same time\u00a0\nit's not an end-all be-all because I don't need\u00a0\u00a0\nthe correcting element I find that if you do\u00a0\nneed the correcting element it's really nice\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause you only you not only get the correcting\u00a0\nbut you also get a Deeper Shade or a shade that's\u00a0\u00a0\nmore going to be towards your skin tone\u00a0\nso like this shade is more correcting and\u00a0\u00a0\nlighter and this shade is more of my actual\u00a0\nskin tone and mixing them both I find gives\u00a0\u00a0\nme a really solid concealer that just really\u00a0\nworks it works really nicely as you can see I\u00a0\u00a0\nhave absolutely no problems with this base and it\u00a0\nlooks fantastic I really do think it looks great\u00a0\u00a0\nnext we're going to Showcase a different thing I\u00a0\nwould have done the I think this is the Contour\u00a0\u00a0\nno this is the bronzer so milk makeup not only\u00a0\nextended and created smaller compacts for their\u00a0\u00a0\nContours they also did with the bronzers I do\u00a0\nhave a contour I don't use Contour as much but\u00a0\u00a0\nI didn't realize that they extended their\u00a0\nbronzer range until after I bought that so\u00a0\u00a0\nnaturally I bought them both but I really love\u00a0\nbronzer more so that's why we're featuring The\u00a0\u00a0\nbronzer in this video and then in a later video I\u00a0\nwill feature the Contour so it is in the smaller\u00a0\u00a0\ncompartment or packaging this is in 5.7 grams\u00a0\nor 0.159 ounces and I only featured that just\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I know some people didn't know that\u00a0\nthis was in the smaller oh my it just broke\nokay all right so we're gonna work with it I\nthe limit exists it exists in this product okay\u00a0\nwell I just lost like half of my product in the\u00a0\u00a0\ntop when I was taking the little plastic top off\u00a0\nI'm gonna try to use this and then I'm probably\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to try to get a replacement because it broke\u00a0\nlike it broke okay this is in the shade spaced I\u00a0\u00a0\nbelieve this is either second to last or the last\u00a0\nshade in their new bronzer range and there we go\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's deep in the best possible way that\u00a0\nis extremely deep so I'm not gonna do a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't even think I'm gonna\u00a0\nbronze my forehead which is\u00a0\u00a0\nsaying something you guys know I love\u00a0\nbronzer I'm just going to see if I can\nspread this out\nI feel like that is still quiet\nstoop this is a nice shade but it also feels\u00a0\ndark like it feels like this is giving me more\u00a0\u00a0\nContour action than bronze action but it's sad\u00a0\nbronzer on the side maybe this was the Contour\u00a0\u00a0\nand it just said bronzer but I feel like\u00a0\nmy my cheekbones are chiseled to the Gods\noh my goodness so definitely\u00a0\na little goes a long way with\u00a0\u00a0\nthis product especially if you are\u00a0\nmy complexion getting this shade\num oh my goodness okay hold on we we need to\nhere I'm gonna use some of my concealer just to\u00a0\u00a0\npush this back because that's very\u00a0\nsteep I feel like it really took over\nand I'm gonna use the concealer to kind of\u00a0\neffectively erase that okay now I think it's\u00a0\u00a0\nlooking manageable I am really heartbroken about\u00a0\nthis though maybe I can somehow get it to fix it\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I hate returning I hate returning things\u00a0\nwe're gonna figure it out but I like the product\u00a0\u00a0\nso far it did blend out very nicely um it just\u00a0\nthat was a lot of pigmentation very quickly\u00a0\u00a0\nso just keep that in mind if you are my skin\u00a0\ntone getting the exact same shade once again\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is in the shade spaced and it says\u00a0\nmatte bronzer on the side let me double check\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah so this says it is a sculpt\u00a0\nstick but this one looks more\nwarm\nI don't know how that works but this is in\u00a0\nthe shade simmer so I showcased this in the\u00a0\u00a0\nVlog that will be live on Monday the night I'm\u00a0\nfilming I just need to do a couple things and\u00a0\u00a0\nclick it to go live so you guys will have seen\u00a0\nthat first but yeah on my skin tone at least this\u00a0\u00a0\nis pulling more of a contour whereas I'm sure\u00a0\nShimmer is going to pull more of a bronzer so\u00a0\u00a0\nyou live and you learn not too mad at this though\u00a0\nnow I don't have a powder per se that I know of\u00a0\u00a0\num that has been owned or founded by a woman so\u00a0\nI am just going to use my Too Faced you guys know\u00a0\u00a0\nI've just been trying to use this powder up I've\u00a0\nhad it for quite some time so give me one second\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm just gonna powder down my face I'm also\u00a0\ngonna just do my brows while I'm off camera\u00a0\u00a0\nand then we still have two different types of\u00a0\nblushes we have a cream blush which yeah we have\u00a0\u00a0\nwe have so many other things to talk about so just\u00a0\ngive me one second okay so we are nicely primed\u00a0\u00a0\nand ready to go I am like all over the place\u00a0\nI put two bronzers in this basket accidentally\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat is this is this a lip oil oh this is like\u00a0\na lip oil no it's not okay I could have sworn\u00a0\u00a0\nI had a like lip oil to test out today but I\u00a0\ndon't see it so we're just gonna keep going\u00a0\u00a0\num and we'll see what happens so um let's finish\u00a0\nup my cheeks so I have like I said two blushes one\u00a0\u00a0\ncream one matte I've seen plenty of videos on the\u00a0\ncream so I knew that this would work on top of my\u00a0\u00a0\npowdered product so I wasn't really stressed over\u00a0\nthis this is the Charlotte Tilbury matte Beauty\u00a0\u00a0\nblush wand this is in the shade dream pop it was\u00a0\nthe only shade I thought would work on me I have\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe one or two shades in this range already\u00a0\nand I thought they were fine and I wasn't\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna pick this up if we're being honest but\u00a0\nthe reviews got me so let me get a brush um\nI don't really like flat brushes\u00a0\u00a0\nfor this type of technique but I think that's\u00a0\nthe only brush that's clean so we're just going\u00a0\u00a0\nto use this flat top brush from rougher and\u00a0\nI'm just going to kind of push this product in\nand it looks fine there's a very very light Sheen\nbut it's not much I did already stop or close the\u00a0\nproduct so this is just the product that was stuck\u00a0\u00a0\nin the top of the doe foot and I'm just going\u00a0\nto try to continue to press this in I think you\u00a0\u00a0\nguys can see a very very subtle flush and that's\u00a0\nfine but if you know me your girl likes color I\u00a0\u00a0\nlike color on my cheeks because if I'm gonna put\u00a0\nmakeup on you're gonna see it you're gonna know I\u00a0\u00a0\ngot it on so not in love with this product right\u00a0\nnow but I will try different application methods\u00a0\u00a0\nboth Under and Over powder because although\u00a0\none method might have worked great for other\u00a0\u00a0\npeople it can work differently for me on my other\u00a0\nside I'm gonna go ahead and try the house labs\u00a0\u00a0\npowder blush I am so excited for this I've\u00a0\nbeen waiting quite some time for this and\nnow I can finally try this out of course\u00a0\nhouse Labs is owned by Lady Gaga or she's\u00a0\u00a0\nthe face of it I don't really know I\u00a0\nbelieve she is the founder of the brand\u00a0\u00a0\num and so yeah we're just gonna go ahead and\u00a0\nuse this baby this is in the shade watermelon\u00a0\u00a0\nBliss this is a very much new range and very\u00a0\nexcited so these are pretty much the same color\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich is another reason why I felt okay kind of\u00a0\nusing two different products on each cheek plus\u00a0\u00a0\nit's night so I'm not going anywhere except to my\u00a0\nbathroom to wash this off when my night is over\u00a0\u00a0\num I think this is applying nice very very nicely\u00a0\nI will say I've had to reach in a couple times but\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's mainly because of the brush and I find\u00a0\nI have to reach in more on my left side just\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause of it being my left side I don't really\u00a0\nknow how to explain it but this feels a lot more\u00a0\u00a0\npigmented than the Charlotte Tilbury so this is\u00a0\nthe Charlotte Tilbury which I feel like kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nBlends into my skin tone makes it look very\u00a0\nvery seamless but this is the house Labs like\u00a0\u00a0\nyou're gonna see house labs and I appreciate\u00a0\nit I appreciate it greatly so yeah we'll see\u00a0\u00a0\nI need to test them both out obviously just to\u00a0\nsee kind of how I like them in the long run but\u00a0\u00a0\nright now I am leaning more towards house Labs but\u00a0\nthat's me I prefer a blush that is more pigmented\u00a0\u00a0\nthan having to build it up time and time again\u00a0\nbuilding things up just isn't for me I don't have\u00a0\u00a0\nthe time nor the patience to truly do it so if I\u00a0\ncan get something that gives me a One-Stop pigment\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm about it I really much am so highlighter I\u00a0\ngot this baby this is the Natasha denona super\u00a0\u00a0\nglow in the shade bronze I've always saw this\u00a0\non the websites between Natasha denona's and\u00a0\u00a0\nlike Sephora and beautylish and all of that but\u00a0\nit looks like this range is actually being kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof discontinued and so it went down a significant\u00a0\num amount recently and so that's when I decided I\u00a0\u00a0\nwas going to pick it up so we're gonna see if we\u00a0\ncan find a somewhat clean brush and I'm gonna go\u00a0\u00a0\nahead and dip into it like I said this is in the\u00a0\nshade bronze I never picked it up because of the\u00a0\u00a0\nshade if we're being honest I felt like it was\u00a0\njust going to be a basic bronze and we'll see\nit very much is looking like a basic\u00a0\nbronze I'm not seeing a whole lot of like\u00a0\u00a0\nuniqueness when it comes to this product\u00a0\nright now it's beautiful don't get me wrong\u00a0\u00a0\nand this isn't our super glow range but I don't\u00a0\nfeel like this is like super glowing off my skin\u00a0\u00a0\num if we're comparing it to other products\u00a0\nthat I recently picked up in the highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of ranges of other brands so I don't\u00a0\nknow this will have to take some time I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink on camera it looks phenomenal it really\u00a0\nis beaming off camera on camera but in person\u00a0\u00a0\nit feels okay it feels nice we'll\u00a0\nsee how it goes setting spray\u00a0\u00a0\nI have my milk makeup but I don't want to use that\u00a0\nagain I want to say the setting spray over there\u00a0\u00a0\nis women owned give me one second so I picked this\u00a0\nup last year during Asian American Heritage Month\u00a0\u00a0\nin the US and I want to say that this is ran\u00a0\nby an Asian American or Asian female this is\u00a0\u00a0\nMana Kadar skincare am I wrong I believe this is\u00a0\na woman-owned business though I will put it on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe screen if I was incorrect and I apologize if I\u00a0\nwas but this is their oil control mattifying Mist\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm just going to spray this to get everything to\u00a0\nseep in I have oils I have an oil primer I have\u00a0\u00a0\ncreams powders all of that and setting sprays\u00a0\njust really help everything to come together\nI forgot that there is a fragrance with\u00a0\nthis um and that first spray was a bit much\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I think that this really\u00a0\nhelped for everything to kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof come together look a bit more like my\u00a0\nskin tone especially with the amount of\u00a0\u00a0\npowder I applied because I did apply quite\u00a0\na bit of primer powder not primer powder\u00a0\u00a0\nso I actually have two lip products I have\u00a0\na Huda beauty product and a glossier product\nI think I'm gonna do the glossier\u00a0\nproduct just because I'm fascinated\u00a0\u00a0\nby this product and I haven't\u00a0\ntried any glossier products\u00a0\u00a0\nto date actually I have this liner okay we're\u00a0\ngonna go with the Huda Beauty I will try this\u00a0\u00a0\nin a different video like I said I'm trying not to\u00a0\nto feature a brand more than once if I can do so\u00a0\u00a0\nso we got the Huda Beauty I'm\u00a0\njust gonna apply my Lys lip liner\nI've been using this lip liner pretty much\u00a0\nnon-stop since I picked it up this is in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shade Soulful um and I will have all the\u00a0\nproducts linked down below if I haven't said yet\u00a0\u00a0\num so it's easier for you all and so I picked up\u00a0\nanother Huda Beauty lipstick right around the past\u00a0\u00a0\nseasonal holiday sale um I think it happened to\u00a0\njust come into my cart because of how much I spent\u00a0\u00a0\nand this one is in the shade the shade self-made\u00a0\nit was a shade that I was interested in so that's\u00a0\u00a0\nwhy I decided to keep this for myself it is of\u00a0\ncourse a brown and so we're just gonna try it\nfresh air\nI like it I like it a lot\u00a0\nthis is a beautiful shade\nvery very beautiful shade and this works\u00a0\nbeautifully with my skin tone very very happy\u00a0\u00a0\nto have picked this up or received it because I\u00a0\ndidn't really technically buy it it kind of just\u00a0\u00a0\nwound up in my cart alrighty so now we're getting\u00a0\ninto Prime Time and for today's eyeshadow palette\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm going to be featuring The Muse Beauty Pro\u00a0\num palette no what is it's the Muse palette I\u00a0\u00a0\ncan't remember the brand I keep calling the Muse\u00a0\nBeauty Pro and I don't think that's the right name\u00a0\u00a0\num Cosmic brushes Cosmic brushes uh Muse\u00a0\npalette I'm so excited to play with this baby\u00a0\u00a0\nI think this is going to be a really beautiful\u00a0\npalette to play with let me just pry my eyes\u00a0\u00a0\neyes are primed I've scooted in so it's easier for\u00a0\nyou guys to see what's going on let's get into it\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is an absolutely beautiful palette\u00a0\nand I really want to see kind of a lot of\u00a0\u00a0\ndepth some Dimension going on so I think first\u00a0\nwhat I'm gonna do is use this Rosewood shadow\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'm going to use this Smith 230 brush\u00a0\nin the outer corner and the inner corner\nand first thing that I'm going to do is just press\u00a0\u00a0\nthis product in those respective\u00a0\nareas just to get a good base going\nand then once I feel the base is\u00a0\ngood I'm just going to use the\u00a0\u00a0\noutside of the same brush just to kind\u00a0\nof slightly blend out that outer portion\nalrighty so we're looking good so far I do\u00a0\nwant to blend that outer edge with a more\u00a0\u00a0\nsignificant color and since I seem to be in the\u00a0\nmustard phase today we're going to go into this\u00a0\u00a0\nmustard yellow and just kind of work it in\u00a0\nto the look this is a royal and land nickel\u00a0\u00a0\ncrease brush this is the bmd 430 okay so I\u00a0\njust took the liberty sorry there was some\u00a0\u00a0\nbackground noise so that's why I kind of just\u00a0\ndid it um but basically what I did was I just\u00a0\u00a0\ntook the mustard tone and I just used it to kind\u00a0\nof lightly blend the outside edge of the purples\u00a0\u00a0\nand in this sense that I felt like certain areas\u00a0\nof the purple weren't dark enough I did just go\u00a0\u00a0\nahead and kind of reapply and I still kind of want\u00a0\nto add some more depth in these areas so what I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to do is take an even smaller blending brush\u00a0\nand I'm gonna go into the shade fig which is kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof the darkest shade in this palette and I'm just\u00a0\ngoing to deepen up the very center if possible of\u00a0\u00a0\nthis outer area and try to keep it lower so that\u00a0\nit kind of diffuses out to the more burgundy\u00a0\u00a0\nand then to the mustard tone we'll just\u00a0\ndeepen out my lower lash line as well with\nyou\nbreak your heart\nalrighty so I'm liking how it's coming\u00a0\ntogether now I need to create my lid shade\u00a0\u00a0\nor the Shimmer shade to go in between and\u00a0\nI think I want to try antique which is this\u00a0\u00a0\nbeauty down here in the corner I think\u00a0\nI want to try this and see how it goes\nthat feels like it's going really really nicely\nand these shimmers feel\u00a0\nextremely creamy extremely creamy\nokay so what I'm just gonna do is just kind\u00a0\nof blend these shimmers in just a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nmore with just the brushes I'm not going to\u00a0\nadd any additional product I just want to\u00a0\u00a0\nblend with what I already had on the brush\u00a0\nand it's not going to be anything intense\nI just like to kind of I don't know cover my bases\u00a0\nif you will and I'm really really liking this\nlike a lot a lot it looks really really nice\u00a0\noh I just thought of something so I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\ntake the antique shade and I'm gonna put it\u00a0\nin the bottom lower middle just to replicate\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat's happening in my upper lock okay my memory\u00a0\ncard ran out of memory but what I'm gonna do\u00a0\u00a0\nis just spray my um brush with my milk makeup\u00a0\nsetting spray and I'm just going to pick up\u00a0\u00a0\nsome of that antique shade hopefully with this\u00a0\nnow Wet Brush and just apply it where I wanted\u00a0\u00a0\nit to because I didn't leave that area open that's\u00a0\nwhy I have to do it because it just really wasn't\nadhering where I wanted it to so yeah that's that\u00a0\nwith this Muse palette I'm loving it so far very\u00a0\u00a0\nvery excited to get more use out of it and to\u00a0\ntest it out more maybe in the future I will try\u00a0\u00a0\nthe brand um again but let's go ahead and go into\u00a0\nthis cream shadow or liquid Shadow I got for free\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom danessa myricks this was a random order at\u00a0\none point I picked this up or was given it and\u00a0\u00a0\nI just never tried it this is one of her twin\u00a0\nflames in the shade crazy for you and I figured\u00a0\u00a0\nthis would be a perfect inner corner highlight so\u00a0\nI'm just gonna take the product I've opened it and\u00a0\u00a0\nwe're just going to take a pencil\u00a0\nbrush and apply it to my inner corner\nhad to make sure y'all saw how stupid I was\u00a0\nthat's a lot of product oh my goodness okay let's\u00a0\u00a0\nblend blend blend I don't even\u00a0\nknow if I can blend that oh\nokay we're cleaning off the brush\u00a0\nand we're gonna try to do my best\nI just I just tapped into the brush\noh my goodness okay so that side is quite\nthat inner corner is quite highlighted I'm just\u00a0\ngoing to take just a 10 tinge more for my left\u00a0\u00a0\nside so that they can look even because from my\u00a0\nperspective they don't now that side looks like\u00a0\u00a0\nit has too much too good gracious okay but overall\u00a0\nI'm really really liking this look I think that\u00a0\u00a0\ntwin flame in the inner Corner looks beautiful I\u00a0\nthink this is the perfect amount and I got it for\u00a0\u00a0\nfree as a sample so yippee once again this is in\u00a0\nthe shade crazy for you all righty we are almost\u00a0\u00a0\nto the end almost to the end I'm gonna try the\u00a0\nglossier eyeliner this is why I decided not to\u00a0\u00a0\nuse the glossier lip product this is their number\u00a0\none pencil the perfect Glide eyeliner in the shade\nI'm sorry guys English is my first\u00a0\nlanguage so I'm gonna just put this\u00a0\u00a0\nin my waterline really quickly I\u00a0\nhave not cleaned out my waterline\u00a0\u00a0\ndone anything I just want to see how\u00a0\nthis works unprovoked just normal\nokay so I don't know if\u00a0\nyou guys can see let me see\nI'm sorry I tried to come in you can clearly\u00a0\nsee that the orange or the mustard tone is on\u00a0\u00a0\nthis water line and not on that one it'll\u00a0\nbe interesting to see how long it lasts\nit did feel like it took me some time to really\u00a0\nget this warmed up and to kind of appear in my\u00a0\u00a0\nwaterline I do kind of always say though I have a\u00a0\nvery inhospitable water line so it does take a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nfor a liner to adhere in there but we're trying\u00a0\nwe're trying so this product is not a woman owned\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I want to try it and we're going to try it for\u00a0\nthe first time I've never tried an eyelash curler\u00a0\u00a0\nand long story short I ended up getting this\u00a0\nvery recently I've seen people use these things\u00a0\u00a0\nwe're going to try to use it in the\u00a0\nway that I've seen people use it\u00a0\u00a0\num let me see where's that terrible mascara\u00a0\nfrom actually we can showcase this again this\u00a0\u00a0\nis from amical so I've seen people showcase\u00a0\nusing a eyelash curler before they put\u00a0\u00a0\ntheir mascara on like I said I've never\u00a0\ntried them before so please bear with me\nis that it I think I did it so I'm just gonna\u00a0\nuse this amicol mascara I have showcased this\u00a0\u00a0\num last month and what I realized after my kind of\u00a0\nFirst Impressions is that this is a mascara that I\u00a0\u00a0\ncan work with I can work with it because although\u00a0\nit can get clumpy if I'm a little bit more\u00a0\u00a0\ncognizant and paying attention and like you\u00a0\nknow just aware I can kind of stop the extra\u00a0\u00a0\nClump that I don't like so I don't actually mind\u00a0\nthis particular mascara I've never seen people re\u00a0\u00a0\nre-curl when they already had mascara on so I'm\u00a0\nnot going to even try that and this is going to be\u00a0\u00a0\nthe real test because this is my left eye I don't\u00a0\neven know if I have Lashes in there oh yeah I do\nokay that wasn't that bad I feel like it was\u00a0\nsupposed to be scarier than it is but I also used\u00a0\u00a0\nto wear contacts so maybe that's why it isn't too\u00a0\nscary for me to bring a random object to my eye\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know let me know if you're a contact\u00a0\nwhere did you freak out using an eyelash curler\u00a0\u00a0\nfor the first time if you wore contacts before\u00a0\nyou tried an eyelash curler I would love to know\nokay yes I just made a boo-boo we'll\u00a0\npick it off once it dries but overall\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is looking great the only thing I'm going\u00a0\nto do is go ahead and apply lashes because we\u00a0\u00a0\nare doing female owned Brands I don't know\u00a0\nif Lily lashes is a women-owned or founded\u00a0\u00a0\nbrand I didn't look into it so just to cover\u00a0\nmy bases we're going to put on some Juvia's\u00a0\u00a0\nPlace lashes I'm probably going to do my Egypt\u00a0\nXLS because you know your girl loves them and\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah give me one second let me do that I'll\u00a0\nscoot back actually no because we need to\u00a0\u00a0\nzoom in so yes you see the whole face so\u00a0\ngive me one second and we'll be back to\u00a0\u00a0\nreally investigate how this makeup is looking\u00a0\nalrighty guys so this is the finished look\nalrighty guys so like I said this is the finished\u00a0\nlook and as per usual with me when it comes to\u00a0\u00a0\nfull faces of either new makeup or old makeup I'm\u00a0\ngonna run through and tell you guys my opinions\u00a0\u00a0\non them and then we'll be good to go so for the\u00a0\nMerit um glow or great skin I really do think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat this is a great product for those who don't\u00a0\nwant too much hydration or real oiliness on your\u00a0\u00a0\nskin I would not say this is the equivalent of a\u00a0\nbeauty oil because I have one and that is straight\u00a0\u00a0\nup oil this has some more liquid in there that\u00a0\nreally makes it kind of seep into your skin better\u00a0\u00a0\nwhereas the beauty oil that I have quite literally\u00a0\nsits on top of my skin so I really do enjoy this\u00a0\u00a0\nfar more and better than that and I find that if\u00a0\nyou are somebody who needs just a little bit more\u00a0\u00a0\nhydration or Luminosity onto your skin prior to\u00a0\nputting on a foundation or a base product that is\u00a0\u00a0\nquite drying and really just emphasizes texture\u00a0\nand stuff off that might be a good option to try\u00a0\u00a0\nin the event that you want to try it when it comes\u00a0\nto the Merit um Foundation or perfecting base\u00a0\u00a0\nstick I really like this once again that's why I\u00a0\npicked up a second shade of it because I wanted\u00a0\u00a0\none that I could use every day for pretty much\u00a0\nevery other season in the year except for summer\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich I would be using the darker shade I really\u00a0\nlike it I felt like this was a great match for me\u00a0\u00a0\nand once again this is in the shade sepia I really\u00a0\nreally like it um I don't know very easy to blend\u00a0\u00a0\nout I prefer blending this out with a foundation\u00a0\nstick wet I prefer blending this out with a brush\u00a0\u00a0\nover a sponge although you can use a sponge I\u00a0\njust feel like you have to use more product if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou use a sponge because you know the wet and\u00a0\nall of that jazz but fantastic product I would\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely definitely recommend another product\u00a0\nnext was my concealer Duo from Sigma Beauty I\u00a0\u00a0\nreally like this Duo and I think this is a great\u00a0\nDuo maybe not a perfect Duo for me as once again\u00a0\u00a0\nI just don't need the correcting element of it but\u00a0\nas just a sheer concealer or whatever I think it\u00a0\u00a0\nworks great and this really works good with like\u00a0\nmy tube type foundations where I find generally\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm reaching for them to have something more as\u00a0\nhigh as a medium coverage but more on the light\u00a0\u00a0\ncoverage type of days so I feel this concealer\u00a0\njust really works with those products and\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's a really really good thing to have in your\u00a0\ncollection and since it's the only one that really\u00a0\u00a0\nworks with that kind of technique in my collection\u00a0\nI absolutely love having it but for the cons the\u00a0\u00a0\ncorrecting aspect I don't really care about that\u00a0\nokay we didn't do a powder let's go to the cheek\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts next where's the weird bronzer stick\u00a0\nthat there it is so for the bronzer stick that\u00a0\u00a0\nappeared to be a contour on me I think ultimately\u00a0\nit works fine and it looks really really nice but\u00a0\u00a0\nI will be interested to see the difference between\u00a0\nthis bronzer stick that pulls very contouring on\u00a0\u00a0\nme compared to the bronzer or the Contour stick\u00a0\nthat looks like it's going to pull a lot warmer\u00a0\u00a0\non me once again I think I picked up the last\u00a0\nshade in this range and the third shade in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe other range and that could definitely play an\u00a0\nelement as to why one of the products pulls darker\u00a0\u00a0\non me and more cool tone than when the other one\u00a0\nI always try to talk about those types of things\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I really need to test out both products and\u00a0\nlook at the Shane Ray shade ranges to figure out\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat it was that I did to figure out kind of\u00a0\nhow I can make it work for me and also to let\u00a0\u00a0\nyou guys know so stay tuned I think formula Wise\u00a0\nIt's really really nice it's just the shade the\u00a0\u00a0\nshade just feels off it feels off next let's go\u00a0\nahead in with the cream blush this is the Pillow\u00a0\u00a0\nTalk matte blush wand this is in the shade dream\u00a0\npop the cream bronzer was in spaced by the way\u00a0\u00a0\num for this blush Cream Blush I think it's\u00a0\nokay it's not a love it's a like right now I\u00a0\u00a0\ndo appreciate that I was able to build it up and I\u00a0\nthink built up it looks nice but I don't know it's\u00a0\u00a0\nnot a love and for the price of this particular\u00a0\nproduct I don't know if I would actually recommend\u00a0\u00a0\nit that's the thing some of these things okay for\u00a0\nthe price sure do I like it yes is it a love of\u00a0\u00a0\ncourse but this for the price I'm feeling quite\u00a0\nhesitant whether I can really recommend it I've\u00a0\u00a0\nonly tried it once though so bear that in mind\u00a0\nI'm hoping to have all of these opinions finalized\u00a0\u00a0\nbefore the VIP sale because I have a feeling it's\u00a0\ncoming up very very soon and I want to make sure\u00a0\u00a0\nyou guys know if I would recommend picking it\u00a0\nup during the sale or picking it up in general\u00a0\u00a0\nthe other blush that I tried today was the house\u00a0\nLabs um color fuse blush this is in watermelon\u00a0\u00a0\nBliss I really do enjoy this blush I think it\u00a0\napplies beautifully it works beautifully on\u00a0\u00a0\nmy skin tone and as you can see it's kind of died\u00a0\ndown but kind of looks a little bit more skin like\u00a0\u00a0\neffortless I've heard people stating that like\u00a0\nthis product works with whatever kind of finish\u00a0\u00a0\nyour base is as I have it this base was kind of\u00a0\nmore of a satin radiant so I don't really know\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I do want to test it more that said if we're\u00a0\ncomparing this to the other house Labs products\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I've tried and loved this is not on the love\u00a0\ncategory some of the other products I absolutely\u00a0\u00a0\nlove and I cannot recommend them enough this\u00a0\nso far is an okay product it's an okay product\u00a0\u00a0\nand once again for the price I don't know if I can\u00a0\ndefinitely recommend it to you guys but so far I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nnot hating it which is a good thing highlighter\u00a0\nwise Natasha nadona super glow I think if you\u00a0\u00a0\nneed a cheap highlighter and you like a bronzy\u00a0\nhighlighter definitely go for it I don't think\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is the end all be-all I don't think that\u00a0\nthis is going to be like you know my top drawer\u00a0\u00a0\nfavorite it's just definitely not going on in the\u00a0\ntop drawer but I enjoy it and I like highlighters\u00a0\u00a0\nit was cheap I was feeling froggy so I jumped I\u00a0\njumped it is that simple for the setting spray\u00a0\u00a0\num once again I'm pretty sure this is a\u00a0\nwoman-owned brand and I do like the setting\u00a0\u00a0\nspray it's not great it's not terrible it's a nice\u00a0\nokay setting spray and for the product it's nice\u00a0\u00a0\nespecially for the price this was available at\u00a0\nUlta and if it's still down in Ulta I will have it\u00a0\u00a0\nlinked down below there if not I will try to find\u00a0\na place that it's available through a us-based\u00a0\u00a0\nretailer because I am US based lip products so the\u00a0\nlip liner you guys know I've been enjoying this\u00a0\u00a0\nlip liner I've talked about it quite a bit it's in\u00a0\nthe review pile I just keep pulling for it because\u00a0\u00a0\nit's the closest Brown lip liner for me Huda\u00a0\nBeauty this is I don't think I even said this is\u00a0\u00a0\nher cream lipstick range this is the same one it\u00a0\nis in the range as the other lipstick that I have\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I've pretty much almost finished I really\u00a0\ndo love this range I think it really just works\u00a0\u00a0\nwith my skin tone this is now two in it and yeah I\u00a0\njust really really like this range I love the like\u00a0\u00a0\nsubtle Sheen that it gives you but the undertones\u00a0\nand in these Browns that are available spectacular\u00a0\u00a0\nfor me and I consider myself um like a dark not\u00a0\ndeep skin tone more on the lighter range of that\u00a0\u00a0\ndark and I do have I would say an olive undertone\u00a0\nso know that mascara wise the amiko mascara like\u00a0\u00a0\nI said when I was applying it I now realize how\u00a0\nI can get this to work is this going to be a\u00a0\u00a0\nfavorite absolutely not but is this as terrible\u00a0\nin my head as the abh absolutely not so you know\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's some there's some even kind of ground\u00a0\nthere when it comes to that particular product\u00a0\u00a0\nthen we have the danessa myrick's Twin Flame\u00a0\nI really like this I think this is the perfect\u00a0\u00a0\namount of product from what I know her actual twin\u00a0\nflames come in a bigger compact this one you get\u00a0\u00a0\nlet's see if it says you get 1.25 milliliters\u00a0\nnet weight of product in this compartment and\u00a0\u00a0\nI think this is a perfectly reasonable amount\u00a0\nfor me I don't reach for these types of products\u00a0\u00a0\nevery day or even halfway consistently once\u00a0\na month so this type of product is going to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe perfect for me to reach for every so often\u00a0\njust to add a little spice to My overall look\nand then last but certainly not least we have the\u00a0\neyeshadow palette so far I think this quality is\u00a0\u00a0\ngreat I used what three mattes and one Shimmer\u00a0\nand it's it's feeling really really nice quality\u00a0\u00a0\nso far definitely let me know down below if you\u00a0\nwant to see some more of this particular palette\u00a0\u00a0\nas I've said now I've been incorporating shorts\u00a0\nevery so often on my channel and if it's something\u00a0\u00a0\nthat you would love to see a short with me maybe\u00a0\nusing particular colors or just showcasing some\u00a0\u00a0\nmore looks let me know there's going to be\u00a0\nso many eye looks coming this month because\u00a0\u00a0\na lot of the palettes that I have that I've been\u00a0\nsitting on are women owned and I really want to\u00a0\u00a0\nshowcase them for you all so definitely shout\u00a0\nout down below your opinions if you've tried\u00a0\u00a0\nany of these products and you love them or you\u00a0\nhate them let us know down below let's give us\u00a0\u00a0\nyour review because sometimes it's not about my\u00a0\nreview it's about the whole Collective communities\u00a0\u00a0\nyou so yeah that's all I got oh and the curler\u00a0\nseems fine seems fine so yeah that's all I got\u00a0\u00a0\nI think am I right did I talk about the eyeliner\u00a0\nI don't think I talked about the eyeliner I think\u00a0\u00a0\nit's fine so far it's not on par with my La girl\u00a0\nbut it also has not already gone away like my\u00a0\u00a0\nwaterline hasn't eaten it yet so it's doing good\u00a0\nit's doing good let's see how good it does overall\u00a0\u00a0\nthough so for referral now I think I've talked\u00a0\nabout all of the products sound off down below\u00a0\u00a0\nyour opinions if you've tried any of these and\u00a0\nI will see you guys in my next video bye

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

12\u00a0\n14 and 16 millimeters and I think I'm gonna do it\u00a0\u00a0\nin that doll eye way that I like to do like 112\u00a0\n114 two or three sixteenths then a 14 and a 12.\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm gonna go ahead and do it on one eye and\u00a0\nthen show you how I do on the other eye and this\u00a0\u00a0\nis just my kit that I always use it's the deluxe\u00a0\nkit so it has the conditioning primer I get the\u00a0\u00a0\nthe pro black glue I have this Lila nashifying\u00a0\nglass that I really like um its counterpart is\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Lilac Street Crystal coat and the remover\u00a0\nwith the child from shelf remover and I love all\u00a0\u00a0\nof these things this is like a it's a nice top\u00a0\nyou don't have to have it one thing I do like\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom lashify though is the wand I'm missing one of\u00a0\nthose random things but it still works really well\u00a0\u00a0\num this is the one that lilac shoe comes with\u00a0\nand it works but you know it's just that curve\u00a0\u00a0\nto get all of the lashes all at once really helps\u00a0\nand you know just yesterday I found this one on\u00a0\u00a0\nSephora it's like a lash extension infuser and it\u00a0\nlooks similar to this but it looks more like an\u00a0\u00a0\neyelash curler like this but then it has pads on\u00a0\nboth ends and it goes like that like you face it\u00a0\u00a0\ntoward your eye and you clamp it down I actually\u00a0\nbought it and I have to go pick it up today so I\u00a0\u00a0\nI guess I can do a review on it or let you\u00a0\nknow how it works compared to this because\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is like 60 or something which seems\u00a0\nridiculous for just a tweezers that's curved\u00a0\u00a0\nbut at the same time I can't even find anything\u00a0\nsimilar on Amazon if you guys find one let me\u00a0\u00a0\nknow and send me the link because I wouldn't\u00a0\nmind trying it out yeah I've only seen like\u00a0\u00a0\nreally pointy ones and ones that are slightly\u00a0\ncurved but not like the whole eye kind of curve\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'll let you know how that Sephora one\u00a0\nworks out you can also use an eyelash curler\u00a0\u00a0\nbut if you do it too hard you could end up like\u00a0\nmaybe permanently curling the Lash a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\ntoo much it's already like a a good D curve at\u00a0\nleast for these volume ones and some of them are\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a c curve so I don't know I don't need\u00a0\nit that curled Elsie is a Q-tip because I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to use the conditioning primer first\u00a0\nand I would not skip this sub this is like\u00a0\u00a0\nkey so I'm going to go ahead and turn the camera\u00a0\naround and I'll show you what I'm doing okay so\u00a0\u00a0\nI did one eye and well I think they look really\u00a0\ngood they're really nice and fluffy and not too\u00a0\u00a0\nI guess dramatic even though they're called\u00a0\nvolume I think actually the the midnights are\u00a0\u00a0\nmore dramatic like you can see or maybe it's just\u00a0\ndarker and thicker these are more fluffy kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nlike if you had Originals on and then you kind of\u00a0\nlike stack them really nicely and that's the thing\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't really like about the originals I mean I\u00a0\nlike it but then they're in smaller segments so I\u00a0\u00a0\nhave to put on maybe like seven pieces versus six\u00a0\nthat I have on now you know so it's just faster\u00a0\u00a0\num so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and do the other eye\u00a0\nI'm gonna get my conditioning primer and my Q-tip\u00a0\u00a0\nand I just did I just filmed the\u00a0\nvideo for my Super Mario nails [Music]\nso it's just enough to get it wet not soaking\u00a0\nbecause you if it gets in your eye it does hurt\u00a0\u00a0\nand then I'll do the top of the lashes um and\u00a0\nI have makeup on I usually would not recommend\u00a0\u00a0\nputting your makeup on first always do your lashes\u00a0\nfirst and then do all your other things around it\nit'll make it last longer because I mean it's so\u00a0\nhard to tell if you have eye cream or something on\nI tried hard not to get it on my lashes but we'll\u00a0\nsee every time I film I feel like they don't last\u00a0\u00a0\nI mean they last but then you know they're not\u00a0\nas like strong as usual so while I let that dry\u00a0\u00a0\nI go ahead and release all the lashes that\u00a0\nI'm going to use just so that's quick and I\u00a0\u00a0\nknow I'm going to use two twelves so what you\u00a0\ndo is kind of push and pull down don't use the\u00a0\u00a0\ntweezers like you might rip out the hairs or\u00a0\nruin it it's just really easy to do it that way\u00a0\u00a0\nso push and pull down especially the\u00a0\nfirst time you use it they're really\u00a0\u00a0\nstuck on there okay so I'm using\u00a0\nsix segments I also have a new glue\u00a0\u00a0\nI had one in like a backup and I was using an\u00a0\nolder one and I mean last week I was like I wanted\u00a0\u00a0\nto film this video but I couldn't because I was\u00a0\nrushing to go somewhere and then I used old blue\u00a0\u00a0\nand then I don't think it was as good like I had\u00a0\nthis one and I I should have just been using this\u00a0\u00a0\nso when you have a new glue it's like nice and not\u00a0\nthin but nice and I guess wet so it's easy to get\u00a0\u00a0\nthe amount that you need on your regular lash and\u00a0\non top of the base of the the lashes so I'm going\u00a0\u00a0\nto go ahead and do um a good coat I have short\u00a0\nlashes so I mean it's not going to stick out past\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know the base for me if you have really long\u00a0\nlashes I would kind of concentrate the glue at\u00a0\u00a0\nthe base not at the ends because then it'll it'll\u00a0\nshow up maybe more over here if that makes sense\nso I don't go all the way in\u00a0\nand all the way out either\nand that's how much glue I put\u00a0\non that's what works for me\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm gonna go ahead and pick up a 12. I always\u00a0\npick it up on a diagonal like this versus straight\u00a0\u00a0\non and it's just easier for me to maneuver the way\u00a0\nI want the Lash to go because the band needs to be\u00a0\u00a0\nparallel to like her waterline or the Lash line so\u00a0\nI'm going to go ahead and tap the glue on the base\nI would say get it enough to get it dark\nand then I'm gonna go in the\u00a0\ncorner but not all the way in\nand while you're there just make\u00a0\nsure it matches the other side\u00a0\u00a0\nso I have a 14 now I'm gonna do the same thing\nand then I'm gonna overlap a little bit\n[Music] that's what really holds the band\u00a0\ntogether when you overlap and that's why\u00a0\u00a0\nyou need to put glue at the base so that\u00a0\nthere's glue to stick onto the previous one\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so now I'm gonna do a 16 and if you feel\u00a0\nlike like sometimes when I do it I feel like\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's a step like you can tell it's like shorter\u00a0\nand longer if you feel like you can see that just\u00a0\u00a0\nmove it a little bit more in or like overlapping\u00a0\nand then it Blends better like I had that on this\u00a0\u00a0\nside and then I just moved it over to overlap with\u00a0\nthe 14 a little bit more and it Blended nicely\nI can show you what I mean so I'll put\u00a0\nit on the overlap it but not enough\nor this is what it looks like not really\u00a0\noverlaps so I mean it's not as gradual\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I moved it I might have\u00a0\nto put a little bit more glue\nokay so I'm gonna do one more 16. and\u00a0\nthis this is just a pattern that I use\u00a0\u00a0\nyou may need a different pattern depending\u00a0\non you know how big your eyes are um yeah\nokay and I'm gonna do a 14 now\nand then the 12.\nand I didn't apply that one to the very Corner\u00a0\neither like one lash in and a lot of times like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe bottom lash will stick to the top lash so just\u00a0\nseparate it before you put the Lash on but yeah so\u00a0\u00a0\nnow I'll just like get the back of my tweezers\u00a0\nand I'll kind of just gently push it on there\nif your tweezers get super sticky in this process\u00a0\nyou can just run some clear coat or Crystal coat\u00a0\u00a0\nover it so now I'm gonna get the crystal coat\u00a0\nand I'm going to do the bottoms and the tops\nso I'm going camping at the beach this weekend\u00a0\nso it is super important that you use the crystal\u00a0\u00a0\ncoat or get a really good coat on there especially\u00a0\non the top too like one of my friends got\u00a0\u00a0\nsand thrown at her from I think one of her kids or\u00a0\none of the kids there and it got all stuck in the\u00a0\u00a0\nglobe so yeah you don't want that okay you gotta\u00a0\nhave to like take it all off so I'm just running\u00a0\u00a0\non the inside of my lashify this one and then\u00a0\nI'm just gonna crimp it I don't wanna come down\nand because I want to make sure I'm\u00a0\ngetting all the crystal coat I'm just gonna\u00a0\u00a0\ndo that again so that it puts\u00a0\nthem on there at the base too\nand then just for my\u00a0\ninsurance I and because I have\u00a0\u00a0\nthe crystal coat or the glass from Flashify\u00a0\nI'm gonna use this so it's like a it has a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle ball and it makes a really good\u00a0\napplicator so I run this along the band\nan alternative like this one is going to be old\u00a0\nsoon I think an alternative would be to get one\u00a0\u00a0\nof these like don't put applicators I used\u00a0\nto use this a lot when I had lash extensions\u00a0\u00a0\nand this is the only really lint-free little\u00a0\nQ-tip thing you can use to like clean in there\u00a0\u00a0\num you can get one this is I have a bunch\u00a0\nyou can buy this on Amazon I'll put the link\u00a0\u00a0\nbelow but it doesn't fit like super into\u00a0\nhere but enough like you can see the tip\u00a0\u00a0\nso you can just turn it around get some on there\u00a0\nand then do the same thing and then you don't\u00a0\u00a0\nhave to buy the glass but having it on this\u00a0\nkind of applicator is a lot more helpful than\u00a0\u00a0\nthis brush when you want to get\u00a0\nit like not sticky at the base\nI feel like I'm gonna put one more coat on top\nso that's it so this is the volume lashes\u00a0\num I guess I will finish up my look I will\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm actually going traveling soon so um I did\u00a0\ndo like a video on my everyday look and that's\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat today is it's Thursday just gonna\u00a0\npick up the kids and probably work out so\u00a0\u00a0\nnothing special but when I'm traveling I do like\u00a0\ndifferent makeups so what I use is these caviar\u00a0\u00a0\nsticks and this is what I use if I go swimming and\u00a0\nyes I like to wear makeup when I go swimming but\u00a0\u00a0\nI have the caviar sticks in vanilla rose gold and\u00a0\ncocoa and this is uh I'll just do it really quick\u00a0\u00a0\num matte I guess light color so you're like\u00a0\nwhoa right then you get a brush I've really\u00a0\u00a0\nbeen liking these Lila B brushes\u00a0\nbecause they're synthetic and thick\nand they clean up really well like easy to wash\u00a0\nso you have to kind of work quickly with these\u00a0\u00a0\ncaviar sticks they're kind of waterproof\u00a0\nI mean that really really waterproof but\u00a0\u00a0\nwater resistant enough where I can like get\u00a0\nsplashed at the pool and it's not coming off\u00a0\u00a0\nand then I'll take the rose gold\nsorry it's really dirty because I use this\u00a0\na lot and I'm just gonna go in the inner\u00a0\u00a0\nhalf of my lid and you can also\u00a0\ndo like the Highlight right there\nI don't wear these every day just because\u00a0\nthey're a little bit harder to take off\u00a0\u00a0\nlike on a daily basis\nand then I'll use the cocoa\nI'm just gonna kind of lightly dot it it's really\u00a0\ndark I'm gonna lightly dot it and blend it out\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'm only gonna do one eye at a time and\u00a0\nsometimes it once it sticks it really sticks\nI would usually use my finger\u00a0\nfor this because it's faster\nokay once you kind of get it\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can I'm gonna have to set it with powder just\u00a0\nbecause I don't like oily products by my lashes\nyou need a little bit more here so I need more I\u00a0\ndot it on I don't swipe it it might be too much\u00a0\u00a0\nand then you just get your finger and Pat it in\nso you can totally go like that and it'll dry\u00a0\nit down um but what I like to do is set it so\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm using this Charlotte Tilbury easy smokey eye\u00a0\npalette it looks like this I don't use this very\u00a0\u00a0\noften because the colors in here are too I think\u00a0\nreddish for my skin tone but it looks good over\u00a0\u00a0\nthis brown kind of color where it's super brown\u00a0\nand not dead looking but kind of I don't know\u00a0\u00a0\nboring looking or something so just to set\u00a0\nthe colors I'm going to use the lightest one\u00a0\u00a0\nand quickly just go over okay that\u00a0\nwas really dark that was too much\u00a0\u00a0\nI forgot to tap it like the most\u00a0\nimportant part so make sure you tap\nand then for the rose gold part\u00a0\nI will use this lighter one\u00a0\u00a0\nlightly put it in and tap and\u00a0\njust go over the rose gold\nand then for the brown I will\u00a0\nuse the darkest color which is\u00a0\u00a0\nnot even that dark because I don't\u00a0\nlike to use this palette by itself\nand just go over the brown and then this\u00a0\neyeshadow will stay like all day for me\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I'm pretty sure I'm gonna\u00a0\nbe walking outside in the ring\nand I don't think my eyeshadow will come off side\nyeah I think that's my travel look I\u00a0\ncan do the eyeliner too really quick\u00a0\u00a0\nit's gonna be a long video so I\u00a0\nalready showed my eyelash or eyeliner\u00a0\u00a0\nway of doing my eyeliner in a previous video I'm\u00a0\nstill using the same one it hasn't run out yet\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm just going to line from the outside not\u00a0\nall the way at the corner of my eye just because\u00a0\u00a0\nI want to bring everything up so you have\u00a0\nto start like a millimeter in and then go up\nI'm just doing like a small wing on the outside\nand then just a note you can't\u00a0\nwash your face for I think at least\u00a0\u00a0\nthree to four hours you have to let the glue\u00a0\ncure one time I messed up on my makeup and I\u00a0\u00a0\nwash my face right after and thinking the\u00a0\nthe lashes would stay and it doesn't it's\u00a0\u00a0\nit'll run down like the black glue will like\u00a0\nrun down your face it's really bad foreign\ntouch it too much just because I just applied it\nI'm essentially connecting the Lash\u00a0\nto the my inner corner with this\u00a0\u00a0\nThrive Cosmetics Lauren eyeliner it's waterproof\u00a0\nit's black it's really good I really like this one\u00a0\u00a0\nand so yeah that would be my eye look I don't do\u00a0\nany eyeliner on the top I don't think you really\u00a0\u00a0\nneed to like unless you really look closely you\u00a0\ncan't see that there are like three separate\u00a0\u00a0\nthings but it still looks like one eyeliner\u00a0\nlook thanks for watching um I hope you like\u00a0\u00a0\nto try these lashes I really like them I was\u00a0\nsurprised I want to try the Brazil next I think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's next on my list I still need to order those\u00a0\nbut those look really nice and feathery and fluffy\u00a0\u00a0\nso yeah thanks for watching please\u00a0\nsubscribe and I'll see you in my next video\n[Music]\nthank you",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

        "transcript_text": "hey guys so for today's video I created this\nbluish green eyeshadow look with the new Sigma\nbeachy eyeshadow palette Sigma is coming out\nwith four new on the go eyeshadow palettes\nso if you want to learn more about these new\npalettes and how I got this eyeshadow look\ngo ahead and keep on watching so in 2021 Sigma\nlaunched their on-the-go palettes they came\nout with six and out of those six ritzy is\nmy favorite but now we have four new ones\nso let me show you what these look like this\none is Jules then we have electric pink and\nthen we have earthy and last but not least\nbeachy so I asked you guys on Instagram which\none you want to see me use and you can see\nthat beachy one which I'm pretty excited about\nand I'm sure you guys want me to use these\ntwo blue Shades right here so I'm totally\ngonna do that today but honestly out of all\nfour of these my personal favorite would be\nearthy again I haven't used these yet but\njust like looking at the color stories I was\nreally drawn to this one I do kind of like\nmore muted simple eyeshadow these days so\nI kind of love the neutral tones but like\nthis pop of a bright green I think is so pretty\nI think the jewel toned one is pretty but\nI think the palette could have been more Jewel\ntone only these three Shades right here and\nkind of this purple right here are on the\njewel tone side but I would have liked to\nsee more of like matte colors that kind of\ngo with these brighter colors in here and\nthen out of the four my least favorite would\nprobably be electric pink and I was kind of\nworried because when I posted the poll on\nmy story electric pink was winning for a minute\nand I was like crap I don't want to use that\npalette but I was gonna use my whatever you\nguys voted for so I was looking at this color\nstory and I was like why does this feel so\nfamiliar to me so let me show you something\nso at first I was feeling it looked kind of\nsimilar to their Rosy on the go palette but\nI was like no that's not right this one has\na little bit more red and kind of more depth\nto it but I found what I was thinking of so\nI figured out the culprit was the sigma Enchanted\npalette one of the big ones is that bright\npink shade in the center of here is very similar\nto the bright pink shade in this palette I'm\nnot going to do swatches to show you but if\nyou look at the pinky Shades in here so like\nthis guy this one this one um this metamorphosis\none is really really similar to the new wave\non the top right there so I just felt like\nthese two were really similar and I didn't\nreally want to use this one but I gotta say\nif you have the enchanted palette you definitely\ndon't need this one so these palettes will\nbe available on sigma's website tomorrow they\nare thirty dollars a piece and you can use\nthe code to Angela bright to save 10 actually\nif you're watching this video on March 13th\nmy code Angela bright will save you 25 percent\nand until tomorrow the 14th so use my code\nAngela bright you'll save money so let's zoom\nin and dig into this palette I'm going to\nstart with the shade Coastline on a sigma\ne25 and I'm going to blend this throughout\nmy entire crease I'm starting on my outer\ncrease because I want the most pigment to\nbe out here so I'm going to build up the shade\nand then slowly bring it into my inner crease\nand of course I did Prime my eyes already\nI've actually been trying to use the Urban\nDecay quickie concealer as an eye primer just\nbecause I like how full coverage it is and\nit does set down really nice so I used that\nand then I set it with the elf Halo glow powder\nthe shade is blending out really nicely though\nI only dipped into it once and it's diffusing\nout beautifully\noh\n[Music]\nso now I'm adding a little bit more of this\nCoastline shade kind of right on this I want\nto call it like the meaty part of my eyelids\nwhen my eyes are relaxed this little part\nright here I want more Shadow one [Music]\nI am going to dip into a skin tone colored\neyeshadow and just blend around that what\nis called Coastline shade just kind of right\nunder the brow and around the edges here just\nto really soften it out\nthank you I really like the tone of that Coastline\nshade like it's not too warm it's not too\ncool it's kind of like perfectly neutral okay\nnow I have to dig into these blue Shades or\nelse I think you guys would be so mad at me\nif I didn't so I don't really know how well\nthese shades are going to apply but I'm going\nto spray my Sigma e57 with a little bit of\na setting spray just to get my brush a little\ndamp and I'm going to start with the shade\nsurf I'm going to start this on the outer\npart of my lid just kind of see what happens\nthe pigment looks beautiful [Music]\nnow I'm going to grab a couple of my small\nblending brushes from my new Sigma favorites\nbrush set I'm going to take my e42 with nothing\non it and start to blend around this blue\nshade this brush is really nice because it\nis a blending brush but it's nice and small\nand it's pretty firm so it's not going to\nmake the shadow go everywhere like it's going\nto stay very precise at where I'm blending\nI think this is literally called yep Precision\nfirm blender like that's exactly what it does\nokay I'm kind of stuck between the sea glass\nshade and this vacay shade like it would be\neasy to use this shade on the inner part of\nmy lid but this one's just so cool let's try\nthis one if it goes terribly I can fix it\nI'm going to take my Sigma switch and I'm\ngoing to get all of the pigment off that e57\nI was just using so there's no blue on it\nI think spraying my brush was a good step\nso I'm going to do that again and I'm going\nto take that vacay shade and let's go in this\ninner half of the lid oh yes I love this kind\nof color\nit's like a yellowy green that is so pretty\noh my gosh I just did the influencer gasp\nI'm so sorry that was a real gasp though and\nthen I'm just going to kind of pack in the\nMiddle where those two shades meet to kind\nof blend it oh my gosh the shade is beautiful\nnow I'm gonna go back to that e42 I was using\nagain I didn't pick up any product on this\nbrush and I'm just going to blend right in\nmy crease around that Shimmer\nI think I am going to take a little bit of\nsea glass on this brush and I'm gonna place\nthat where these two shades are meeting so\nalmost is like a little blending shade for\nthese two\nthat's so fun and then I think I am going\nto touch up that surf shade\nthank you [Music] I have zero Fallout with\nthese shimmers so that is really nice I am\nsuper happy with how this lid looks so let's\ndo the other one again using my Sigma switch\nto get off any pigment this thing is literally\nthe best guys all right and again I sprayed\nmy brush and I'm starting with surf\nand then again blending around that with my\ne42\nall right\nnow going in with a vacay\n[Music] and just kind of padding in the middle\nto kind of blend these two together and then\ntaking a little sea glass right in the middle\nhere [Music] and then just touching up surf\na little bit more thank you\nall right I'm super happy with how that looks\nI'm gonna go do the rest of my face makeup\noff camera and then we'll finish up the eyes\ntogether all right I am back my face makeup\nis on so let's finish up the lower lash line\nI really want to try this Riptide shade so\nI'm going to take it on a sigma E21 I think\nI am going to spray my brush too because I\ndon't want this Fallout on my face that would\nnot be good now that my face makeup is done\nall right so I'm going to place that along\nmy lower lash line oh it's dark [Music] can\nyou even tell that there's like a color there\nI feel like it looks almost black doesn't\nit hmm I kind of want to Swatch this shade\noh it feels really creamy black right it's\nlike black with the gold Shimmer which is\ninteresting because they have a matte black\nin the palette so I don't really know if these\nare both needed if they both look so dang\ndark I honestly thought this Riptide shade\nwould have more green to it but it looks like\nstraight black to me honestly and I am getting\nFallout with it not good okay I'm gonna take\na clean Sigma e27 and kind of blend around\nthat\n[Music]\n[Music]\nand then blending with my e27 [Music]\nall right that shade got a little messier\nthan I would have liked honestly since it\nlooks like a matte black like you might be\nable to see a little bit of Sparkle in there\nbut I don't feel like this and the matte black\nwere necessary I think I would like to see\nmore of like a green shade in here that would\nlike go nicely with the blues instead of that\none but it's fine I can make it work I'm gonna\ngo back to my skin tone colored eyeshadow\nand just blend right around that shade just\nto soften it a tad [Music]\nuh that's kind of frustrating because I had\nno Fallout with any of the colorful shades\non my lid but that Riptide shade kind of got\ninto my lower eye area right here it's really\nhard to get this out of your under eyes well\nlet's finish off by highlighting the eyes\nso I'm going to take Sandbar on a sigma e33\nI've been liking using a fluffy brush like\nthis for my inner corner and brow bone highlight\njust makes it look more diffused and natural\nI guess and then a little right under here\nall right I'm gonna go pop on some mascara\nand lashes and then I'll show you the full\nface all right my mascara and lashes are on\nI did pop a little bit of a black liner in\nmy waterline and I've been trying this new\neyeliner by Wonder skin they sent this to\nme this is the 1440 long wear eyeliner I just\nused the black shade I think it might be a\ndupe for my favorite house lapse one I put\nit in my waterline and it's so creamy like\nI said I've been using it it is hard to get\noff it is definitely a long wearing eyeliner\nso we'll see how I feel about this and for\nmy lashes I'm just wearing a half flash today\nI'm wearing the bright lashes half lash and\nflirt since the lower lash line is so dark\nand heavy I didn't want to wear a big heavy\nlash so just a little half lash is super cute\nI like how this looks all right and here's\nwhat the full face looks like on my lips I'm\nwearing my two lip products that are in my\nproject pan and my Charlotte Tilbury iconic\nnude lip liner and my Fenty Beauty gloss bomb\nand fussy and then for my blush today I'm\nwearing the sigma blush and sunset kiss I\nfeel like this color goes perfect with these\neyes today because it's kind of like a bright\npink that goes with these bright blue and\ngreen colors I honestly don't know what my\nmy hair is doing I'm kind of growing it out\njust a little bit because I'm getting a haircut\nat the end of March so I'm letting it grow\nuntil then so it's kind of heavy and just\nfalling all over the place but I love how\nthis eye look turned out I think this gradient\nfrom that kind of yellowy green to the blue\nis so pretty and I like the dark lash line\nwith it but I did not like that Riptide shade\nit was just so messy I have like dark pigment\npressed into my under eyes right now you can't\ntell from this distance but if you got up\nclose you'd be like oh I am kind of wondering\nwhat that Riptide shade would look like just\nlike packed all over the lid for like a really\nSmoky look I think that could be fun but yeah\nI don't know I would love to know your thoughts\non these new on the go palettes if you want\nto see me use another one let me know which\none you want me to use I feel like I would\nprobably use either earthy or Jewels again\nI don't really love the electric pink but\nI love the shades in these two so I hope you\nguys enjoyed this video thank you so much\nfor watching and don't forget to like And\nsubscribe",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

Diese Dinger sind ja extra so konzipiert, dass sie die Haut reizen und damit die Lippen aufplustern. Ich glaube teilweise ist da auch so Chili, Pfefferminz und sowas drin. Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

You can choose the coverage too, it\u2019s buildable. So if you picked a too intense color like wicked apple, you can put it on your finger and dab over your lips and it will look super natural but more flustered. 10/10 product",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

Diese Dinger sind ja extra so konzipiert, dass sie die Haut reizen und damit die Lippen aufplustern. Ich glaube teilweise ist da auch so Chili, Pfefferminz und sowas drin. Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

        "transcript_text": "hello everyone it's me Natalie in this\nvideo I'm gonna show you how I do my\ndaily makeup look by using my favorite\nmakeup product in simple steps and easy\nto follow without further Ado let's get\nstarted first I'm prepping my skin\nbefore starting to apply makeup to make\nsure that my skin is plump and hydrated\nso that the product will sit smoothly on\nthe skin I'm applying a Mac word toner\nby I'm from and beta glue gun\nmoisturizer by ionic they are very\ngentle on my sensitive skin and provide\nenough hydration without being too heavy\nI'm wearing a chemical sunscreen by\nbeauty of joseon that sits beautifully\nunder makeup without a white cast\ncausing filling and flakiness a little\nbit of a silicone-based makeup primer to\nmake a clean canvas to blur out my pores\nfine lines and wrinkles so the makeup\ncan sit more long wearing and smooth the\nfoundation I'm wearing is CC cream by It\nCosmetics that provide full coverage\nbeautiful texture and very skin like\nwithout being too heavy on the skin or\ngives greasy finish it has SPF 50 which\nis great as a sun protection this is my\nall-time favorite as it doesn't irritate\nmy skin and causing breakout I apply it\nwith my favorite brush from real\ntechnique to even it out\n[Music]\nI'm using a concealer from the same\nbrand It Cosmetics to cover my dark\ncircle that gives a full coverage\nwaterproof crisp-free and long wearing\nfinish\n[Music]\nI applied this product with the same\nbrush to buff it out\n[Music]\nas soon as applying under eye concealer\nI'm using a setting powder by makeup\nforever to set the under eye area to\nprevent from creasing the product comes\nwith a mesh on top that prevents from\nover spilling now moving on to the eye\nmakeup I use dark brown brow pencil by\nHolika Holika to fill in the gap of my\nrather thick eyebrows\n[Music]\nforeign\n[Music]\nskin to begin with I'd like to prep my\neyelid with primer beforehand to make\nsure the product doesn't smudge and sit\nwell all day long\n[Music]\nas for the eyeshadow I'm using a Korean\nmakeup eyeshadow from corinco palette of\nsix different colors it has a warm shade\nof Peach and coral as well as Shimmer\nand glitter which in my opinion is\nsuitable for daily and party loop\nI take the shade in number two as the\nbase and apply it on the eyelid\n[Music]\na little bit over the crease and also\napply it onto the lower lash line\nthen take the darker shade in number\nfive and apply it onto the inner and\nouter corner of the lid\nand then also apply a little bit onto\nthe inner and outer corner of the Lash\nline and then blend it using a fluffy\nbrush\n[Music]\nthen take the darkest shade in number\nsix and apply it onto the outer corner\nof the lid as close as possible to the\nupper lash line and brush it carefully\ntowards the center part\nforeign\nit using a fluffy brush\nto make the eye makeup look more\ndramatic you can add Shimmer or glitter\non top to brighten it up so I take the\nglitter shade in number four and apply\nit onto the center of the eyelid\nand take the Shimmer shade in number one\nand apply it onto the lower lash line to\nbrighten up the eyes\n[Music]\nand also apply it in the inner corner of\nthe eyes\n[Music]\nto create a winged line I prefer to use\nwaterproof gel liner by Bobby Brown and\na tapered hat from bristle brush to\ncreate a smoother fine line for me it's\neasier to control the thickness and the\nsharpness of the line by using this than\na liquid eyeliner\n[Music]\nforeign\n[Music]\nforeign\nfollowed by applies much proof and\nwaterproof liquid tattoo eyeliner by Kat\nVon D onto the upper lash line\n[Music]\n[Music]\nthen I curl my lashes before putting on\na mascara\n[Music]\nthe mascara that I use is by type which\ngives a waterproof smudge proof and long\nwearing finish\nforeign\n[Music]\n[Music]\nI'm using winter wonder clam looks eye\npalette from tarte the shade is also\nperfect for contouring and highlighting\nthe face with the part of my face that I\nusually Contour is the side of my nose\nby drawing the line on the side of nose\nbridge between the eyes\nforeign\n[Music]\nof the nose tip\n[Music]\nand connecting the two lines together by\nblending them smoothly without word\nStrokes you need to blend them until the\nharsh line disappears\n[Music]\nthen the next part to Contour is\nunderneath my cheekbones and under my\njawline and blend them smoothly until\nthe harsh line disappears\n[Music]\nthen using the same palette in this\nshade to highlight the bridge and the\ntip of my nose as well as my Cupid bow\n[Music]\nas for the blush I'm using the one from\nRamen this is a Korean makeup product in\nthe shade of Tamarind which gives a\nlittle bit of a peachy orange shade and\nusing my real technique blush brush to\napply it on my cheeks closer to the\ncheekbones to give a lifting effect\n[Music]\nfor the highlighter I'm using the same\npalette by tarte in this shade and\napplied on the cheekbones and brow bones\n[Music]\n[Music]\nas for the lips I'm wearing crushed lip\ncolor by Bobby Brown in the shade of\nBlondie pink that gives a satin matte\nfinish\n[Music]\nI'd like to combine the color with other\nlipstick to make the shade a bit more\ncomplement with the eye makeup look so I\ncombine it with Mac Made lipstick in the\nshade of world to make the shade looks\ndeeper\n[Music]\n[Music]\num to be honest I'm not sure what to do\nwith my hair\nas it's too short for a fancy hair look\nshould I tie it up and make a bun but\nit's a little bit too short for that so\ngive me a couple of minutes and I'll\ncome back soon\n[Music]\nso here is my final look I hope you guys\nenjoy this video and find it useful if\nyou guys like it please give it a thumbs\nup and subscribe to my channel thank you\nguys for watching I'll see you in my\nnext video\n[Music]",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

Diese Dinger sind ja extra so konzipiert, dass sie die Haut reizen und damit die Lippen aufplustern. Ich glaube teilweise ist da auch so Chili, Pfefferminz und sowas drin. Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

        "transcript_text": "hello It's Annabelle\nyou're\nhappy to test the new foundation who said the buddhale the\nhigh coverage serum foundation so high coverage I admit that it doesn't make me trip and\nI have some apprehensions but hey it seems that it's really so so great I arrived\nafter the war we saw it pass on lots and lots of channels various brides the box well here\nit's very pretty I took it in color 0.18 the forehead the sorry bottle is in green that I\n'm less of a fan with the little crimps reminiscent of the first taste of Apple in a\ncompact version there are a lot of colors I confess I got lost I hope in any case that\nit's going to be okay apparently you have to wait a short period of time to really see the\ncolor appear the color you apply that's what it says in any case on the site\nwhat to tell you about this foundation so it's a high foundation coverage natural infinite buildable\ncoverage without transfer that resists heat and perspiration it\n's good today it's a little over 30 degrees I was going to tell you 18 but 18 is\nthe color he didn't care and the coverage is adjustable the application l application either with\na sponge or a brush and the denser your brush, the stronger the coverage will be,\nas usual I'm back without make-up I'm back without make-up I applied\nmy usual daily care I applied my base in refill mode the serum from Lanc\u00f4me\nthe Primer serum from Lanc\u00f4me hydration which works really well which holds the\nmake-up well it's something quite stable so I use it today to the crash\ntest of the foundation I have already done my dark circles and well, let's go for the application of the foundation\nas usual I'm going to do you one side one brush side and then one side one side\none side and for I am looking for my words the color\nseems to me a little dewy a little bit clear but hey\nI v ais trying to apply the same on each side\nso I always have some apprehensions when I read foundation eau de couvrance here I\nconfess it's not it's not necessarily the thing I appreciate more than that I see not what I have\nto hide so here it is but hey it's fashion so I bend to orange fashion it's gone my kiki\nit's a little clear\nfor once it's a little clear I'll tell you\nso other covering yes but hey no more than that in any case at the time no more than that\nin any case that's talent very good it's very pleasant to handle\nis it a myth that it is the 2023 foundation maybe not in any case it's\nquite pretty it's still a little bit sticky so I'm going to let it dry I'm going\nto take my brush from cosmetics and let's go for the application on the brush side\nI like it there is not too much smell\nin any case it melts super super quickly I would tell you that perhaps the application with the brush\nis a little more covered rant I think that for a really very very covering application a\nbrush a little denser than the hit you will give the best satisfaction I am not\nparticularly looking for coverage I just want skin good-looking skin full of health rather\na little bit luminous j I don't particularly have any imperfections to hide so so there you go\nthe color the color is not bad I have read on many sites that the color sometimes tends\nto oxidize a little bit the application with a brush dries much faster sponge side\nit's the same finally it's the same it dried less quickly but it's dry and there it's already dry\nI'm going to take my little mirror to see myself closer\nit's quite pretty\nI have a polish a little\nso on the brush side it's true that it's much more\nmuch more covering\nthe ports are quite blurred I don't really like the rendering on the brush side at this level it\nlooks like it's frying my skin I'm going to give it a little help of sponge on the brush side\nin any case that hides all the imperfections well it blurs relatively very well\nthe ports on the brush side I am less satisfied I find that my skin is a little less smooth\nI have the impression that it dries out my skin quite quickly even though I have combination skin\nnormal tigration zone here I am not suffering from dehydration and there I think it's less pretty I\ngo powder and with the powder from tarte cosmetics see what it looks like once powdered\nso I always apply it with a brush I can't bring myself to apply my powder with a puff\nI don't put any more honestly this lightning is super good and I don't\nneed to put 30 tons of it so with the powder for once I have skin I have\nbaby skin it's really that's it finished the job of blurring\nit coats the light a little but good since I have a slightly plump tea area I\ndon't despair that is luminous that stands out it's not bad I'm going to apply the rest of my\nmake-up and I tell you what I think here I finished my make-up I applied my bronzer\ncontour wa nted from Charlotte Tilbury well it blended well I wanted to try something\nliquid on this foundation I didn't have any displacement of material that went super well\nthen I applied the blush from at Cosmetics but I only used the\nlightest color to really give an effect a pastel effect an effect not too marked on\nthis foundation and that's very well placed it didn't went well it\nslipped on it good after I did my eyes here is the first assessment hot like that\nI find that finally the color light 18 and well it's not bad it's not too golden it's not\ntoo pink and it's being a little lighter than my cleavage, but hey, warming\nit up nicely, it does the job at the ports, so there I have skin that's crazy but super smooth,\nit's really very healthy skin and I I was afraid to apply this\nhigh coverage foundation, I must admit that I had some reluctance and frankly nt it's rather pretty it\ndoesn't weigh down the braids it's it's very pretty it's very thin there is a little light that emerges\nit's your skin better without imperfection without pork without anything more what finally it's the\nperfect foundation normally it's heat resistant it doesn't transfer so I'm going to go\nlive my life today it's a little over 30 degrees so we'll see if it survives the\nheat at the perspiration and I'll be back to you this evening for Milan end of the day see you later\nin all my crash tests I'll meet you at the end of the day for the assessment I haven't\ndone any touch-ups since this morning when I applied the Apple taste serum foundation\nfrom KVD beauty there it is 7:30 p.m. and here it is and here it is and here is the result after one\nday it's a day where we had a little over 32 degrees so I sweated he\nlived the heat and frankly but what a beautiful foundation I didn't have I could have added\na fixing spray I could have done a little ret Ouch I did absolutely nothing of all\nthat I still applied a rather moisturizing base on my forehead the primer serum\nfrom Lanc\u00f4me I just applied my little powder from tarte which is just fabulous\nso with this background complexion but the result is really tip top my ports remain blurred\nI have no displacement of material yes then my chin is starting to become a little pink I\nstarted editing the beginning of the video earlier so I I was a little dressed on it\nbut nothing catastrophic with a temperature I tell you which was a little over 32\u00b0c I\nsweated I didn't rub myself either but it aged really well damn but what a beautiful\nfoundation the headlights held up well on that it faded and it faded nicely\nI like I really like it frankly my pores remain blurred I had a little apprehension on the\nside where I applied it with a brush so from this side where I found that there it had an\neffect on me a bit of text ure but I don't know there was a little thing that happened during\nthe application and there frankly I have absolutely nothing at all on the sponge side well it aged the same in terms\nof coverage I would tell you that it is not played out much much it's beautiful what\nit's beautiful I understand why this foundation is going viral on social networks because\nfrankly the result is really nice what if I had to go out but I would say to myself\nyou don't have time to do a touch up it doesn't matter you know anyway it's still a good\nresult I like this foundation very much even if it still has a little my little\nred spot when I touch myself I have no weight effect it's just 100% light just from\nthe light and not the fat it subdued my T zone in any case it tolerated it well and the result is\nbeautiful but after a foundation like that so hot what am I going to test next month finally\nbecause there I I don't want this one suits me very well I really liked the result a little bit\nmath but not too much a bit of l light but not too much coverage that still wants to be\nhigh but the rendering it doesn't mask it hasn't weighed down my face no frankly\nfor the moment it's a top and I hope it will remain so I I'm going to continue to mistreat it I\n'm going to try to

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

        "transcript_text": "Hello beautiful and welcome back to my channel\u00a0\nand welcome to this video we are going to dive\u00a0\u00a0\ninto this wait I have them here the new matte\u00a0\nObsession palettes I think that's what they call\u00a0\u00a0\nCool Math obsessions and warm matte Obsessions By\u00a0\nHuda Beauty I love an all matte eye look so for me\u00a0\u00a0\nthese seem like a lot of fun so I'm gonna do a\u00a0\nlook with each we're gonna do some swatches and\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna let you know if I think that this is\u00a0\na good matte formula or not and if you haven't\u00a0\u00a0\nbeen it before do consider subscribing because\u00a0\nI do upload quite a lot of videos every week\nso I did buy these over at Sephora this is the\u00a0\nwarm one and this is the cool one I ordered\u00a0\u00a0\nnext day delivery and it said it was going to be\u00a0\ndelivered on Tuesday the 28th but they shipped it\u00a0\u00a0\non Tuesday the 28th so I really wish that Sephora\u00a0\nwould just stop giving me a date when they're not\u00a0\u00a0\neven gonna ship it out before that date I don't\u00a0\nmind if it says express shipping and then they\u00a0\u00a0\nship it out a bit later but don't tell me that\u00a0\nit's coming on Tuesday and then you ship it on\u00a0\u00a0\nTuesday but here they are they came to me on\u00a0\nWednesday night eight o'clock and filming this\u00a0\u00a0\non Thursday morning I'm actually really excited\u00a0\nto be trying these outfits like I said I love an\u00a0\u00a0\nall matte eye look and even though I'm not always\u00a0\nthe one that reaches for neutrals if it's an all\u00a0\u00a0\nMac neutral look that has a lot of contrast and\u00a0\ndrama I am all about it so I'm gonna actually\u00a0\u00a0\nstart with this one the warm neutral palette it\u00a0\nhas two which from the pan I can only assume are\u00a0\u00a0\ncream Shadows because I know that there is going\u00a0\nto be some cream matte shadows in here as well\u00a0\u00a0\nand we're definitely going to be trying out that\u00a0\nformula too I really like the mix of terracottas\u00a0\u00a0\nand Peach and there's like it is almost yellow\u00a0\nwith some Browns I think there's going to be a\u00a0\u00a0\nreally cool one and then cool one pun intended\u00a0\nthis is the cool one and this is more what Huda\u00a0\u00a0\nBeauty usually does when she does neutrals which\u00a0\nis mobs pinks burgundies but I really like the\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's a really dark burgundy in here and the two\u00a0\ncreams in here are more mid-tone than the ones in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe other palette which is a dark and a light\u00a0\none so I like the variation as well I love that\u00a0\u00a0\nreally pastely uh pink shadow we're definitely\u00a0\ndoing something with that and I want to show\u00a0\u00a0\nyou two different techniques that I do when I do\u00a0\nall math looks to show you how you can Spruce it\u00a0\u00a0\nup a little bit if you're doing all matte looks\u00a0\nthese were 32 dollars each and I thought when I\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen I looked at the price I was like do they\u00a0\nused to be 32 but no they didn't because I looked\u00a0\u00a0\nat the Huda beat website and the nude obsessions\u00a0\nwere 29 each I'm guessing she's upping the price\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit because a math formula normally\u00a0\nis cheaper to produce than a shimmer formula\u00a0\u00a0\num and the cheapest from what I've heard from\u00a0\nbackstage from Brand owners is pressed Glitters\u00a0\u00a0\nunless it's like a super sparkly you know like\u00a0\na Topper or a holographic or a multi-com or\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething those are the absolute most expensive\u00a0\nones but yeah let's dig into these palettes I\u00a0\u00a0\nhope you will enjoy the video I know I will\u00a0\nenjoy these looks because I'm actually super\u00a0\u00a0\nexcited to be wearing all matte looks today\u00a0\nand if you're wondering about any of the things\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I'm going to be talking about in today's\u00a0\nvideo everything is going to be linked in the\u00a0\u00a0\ndescription box including the other things that\u00a0\nI have on my face in case you're interested in\u00a0\u00a0\nseeing what Foundation I'm wearing what blush\u00a0\nthat is all of that before I get into this\u00a0\u00a0\nI kind of want to Swatch the cream Shadows\u00a0\nbecause I want to be like I want to have a\u00a0\u00a0\nfeeling for what kind of queen Shadows these are\u00a0\nbecause as I'm filming this I haven't swatched\u00a0\u00a0\nthis even though you've seen this watches so\u00a0\nlet's see what we are getting ourselves into\u00a0\u00a0\noh yeah they're definitely not a super greasy\u00a0\nformula which makes me really happy because\u00a0\u00a0\nthat means that they're probably gonna die\u00a0\nreally good with matte shadows which I mean\u00a0\u00a0\nthey should during the math palette but listen\u00a0\nyou never know with Brands sometimes you think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat like they should have this figured out\u00a0\nand they just really don't so I think I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nstart with this one that is the cream of brown\u00a0\nand I'm just actually gonna put that out here\u00a0\u00a0\nin my outer Corner because I want to see what\u00a0\nkind of depth we can get if we start with the\u00a0\u00a0\ncream shadow and then build the other mat on\u00a0\ntop because that's what you can do with the\u00a0\u00a0\nNatasha denona cream the powder you can put them\u00a0\nunderneath and then a mat on top and you can get\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a super nice deep sultry result and get the\u00a0\nmatte to look even deeper without looking patchy\u00a0\u00a0\nvery easy to spread out doesn't\u00a0\nlook patchy very nice tone\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna switch to a different brush\u00a0\nto just buff The Edge a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nis that a fluffy fluff that is a fluffy fluff\u00a0\nokay I'm very very impressed with how that looks\u00a0\u00a0\nthat looks absolutely incredible big fan I'm\u00a0\ngetting put some of this under my eye as well\nso that we can have a similar result up and bottom\u00a0\u00a0\nnow I'm gonna see if I can warm up the crease\u00a0\na little bit and I want to use this that's a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle yellowy because I love mean you can\u00a0\ntell I love yellow and this is more of a\ndarker yellow almost leaning a little bit Orange\u00a0\u00a0\nand I am gonna warm up the entire crease with\u00a0\nthis color and then we're gonna deepen it up\u00a0\u00a0\nwith the dark brown oh I actually really like\u00a0\nthat so I'm just putting a light layer of this\u00a0\u00a0\nin the edge here on the edge here grammar not my\u00a0\nthing English is not my first language and I still\u00a0\u00a0\nstruggle a lot with like grammatic things\u00a0\nand just pronunciation of different words\u00a0\u00a0\nthat Blended effortlessly so this is where we\u00a0\nare right now I've just Blended out with the\u00a0\u00a0\nyellow and I think I'm gonna take this cream\u00a0\nshade the light one and I am gonna attempt\u00a0\u00a0\nLet's cross our fingers and hope for the best\u00a0\nI'm gonna attempt with a flat brush that's pretty\u00a0\u00a0\ndetailed to do a little bit of a cut crease\u00a0\nI love doing a cut crease with a Matte Shadow\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's like lighter so I'm\u00a0\nnot gonna do something that is\nlike two two detailed I'm not going in with like\u00a0\nmy little I was gonna say Looking Glass what\u00a0\u00a0\nis it called the magnifying glass I'm not I'm\u00a0\nnot doing that we're not doing that we're just\u00a0\u00a0\ndoing it a little easy and I'm putting some in my\u00a0\ninner corners and a little bit down here as well\u00a0\u00a0\nand just doing a little bit of a half moon in\u00a0\nhere the important thing is the brush you need\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething detailed and pointy like this one this\u00a0\none is from Bella Beauty Bar but actually they're\u00a0\u00a0\nhard to find I was gonna say other brands have\u00a0\nthem too they've been a little hard to find so\u00a0\u00a0\nonce it looks like this we're taking the matte\u00a0\nand we're gonna set this with the mat I'm using\u00a0\u00a0\nit on the other side you see I have the cream here\u00a0\nI'm going in with the other side of the brush and\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Matte Shadow and I'm just gonna pack this on\u00a0\nthis is actually a little darker than I thought it\u00a0\u00a0\nwas gonna be I actually really thought that this\u00a0\nShadow was gonna be lighter than this thing that\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe what I really wanted from this palette\u00a0\nwas something that was even lighter than this\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause this is not as light as I thought\u00a0\nit was going to be so it seems like that\u00a0\u00a0\ncream shadow is the lightest shade and the\u00a0\nother one is actually a little bit more\u00a0\u00a0\nof a peach I'm putting a little bit more of the\u00a0\ncream here just to lighten up in my inner corner\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me use this is a small brush I'm just using a\u00a0\nlittle bit more of that orange and I'm just gonna\u00a0\u00a0\non the edge\nyeah that looks a little better just to\u00a0\nget it to be a little bit more contrasty\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna finish up the other eye as well\u00a0\nbut we're gonna use this dark brown that\u00a0\u00a0\nis the Matte Shadow and now we are\u00a0\ngonna put that on top of the cream\nand deepen this up and blend into\nso it turns in a little bit like\u00a0\nthis I like putting the dark\non half the lid to really get the drama maybe\u00a0\nI'll actually meet up with a little bit of that\u00a0\u00a0\nyellowy orange just put that on top so this\u00a0\nis the look and I really do like it I think\u00a0\u00a0\nI think it turned out pretty good I'm happy\u00a0\nwith it the only thing I wish is that this\u00a0\u00a0\none was a little bit more contrasty I wish that\u00a0\nthat was just a little lighter a little brighter\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause when you use that powder Shadow it did\u00a0\nbecome just a little darker than I was hoping\u00a0\u00a0\nif that had just had a little bit more white\u00a0\nin it it would have been a Perfection for me\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so I am putting in a little bit of just beige\u00a0\nin my wood line because I think I like how that\u00a0\u00a0\nlooks I really wish that this would just have been\u00a0\na little bit more contrasty and I don't know why I\u00a0\u00a0\nwas thinking I was going to get this contrast but\u00a0\ninstead it's just very peachy I like the look and\u00a0\u00a0\nI like the quality but I really I mean I can't\u00a0\nlie I I really wish that this one just showed up\u00a0\u00a0\nlike different maybe it's because I put the cream\u00a0\nunderneath maybe if I put like a white underneath\u00a0\u00a0\nit's going to be different I'm gonna have to\u00a0\nexperiment a little bit more I like the quality\u00a0\u00a0\nI wish there was more contrast in the palette than\u00a0\nwhat I thought it was going to be just looking at\u00a0\u00a0\nit okay so let's dive into this one then let's\u00a0\ndive into this one and see what we can get\u00a0\u00a0\nam I just gonna be using the mats this time I\u00a0\nthink I might do that and I'll do a similar look\u00a0\u00a0\nthat just brightens up the eye and opens it up\u00a0\nand just lifts a little bit but using a different\u00a0\u00a0\ntechnique okay I encountered a little bit of a\u00a0\nsnag so the look that I had on before because\u00a0\u00a0\nnow I'm filming after lunch I filmed the other one\u00a0\nearly this morning like we're talking 7 30 this\u00a0\u00a0\nmorning and now after lunch around it's currently\u00a0\nthree o'clock I took off the other eye look and as\u00a0\u00a0\nI was taking it off I was like wow this really\u00a0\ncreased and then I took it off and I was like\u00a0\u00a0\nyou didn't show it so I'm telling you right\u00a0\nnow that those cream shadows in that other\u00a0\u00a0\npalette they creased like that was their PHD\u00a0\nit was intense like it was creasing really bad\u00a0\u00a0\non both my eyes both the light cream shadow and\u00a0\nthe dark cream shadow so for that reason I will\u00a0\u00a0\nnot be using the cream shadows in this palette and\u00a0\ninstead I'm going to show you a different kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nlook that I like to do when I want to do an all\u00a0\nmatte look and this is a little bit easier than\u00a0\u00a0\nthe other look because there's no cut creasing\u00a0\nbut I'm so stupid for not showing you but that was\u00a0\u00a0\nthat was definitely welcome to crease City so\u00a0\nwhat I'm going to be doing for this look is\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I'm going to be using the three shadows that\u00a0\nare in the middle here or maybe even this one I\u00a0\u00a0\nmight use this one because it is even lighter\u00a0\nso I'm gonna start with the darkest one and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen this mauve and then I'm gonna end with this\u00a0\none and I am just gonna use them and like more\u00a0\u00a0\nin Sweden you say trip troll would it be here\u00a0\nnot Eeny miny mo but like just like plopping\u00a0\u00a0\nthem on next to each other and then blending them\u00a0\ntogether it's just such an easy way to get a nice\u00a0\u00a0\neye look so I'm starting with the darkest color\u00a0\nout here and I'm just putting that out here and\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm not putting it inwards I'm not going to put\u00a0\nit in the inner part of the crease just out here\u00a0\u00a0\ngently gently blending on the edge like that\u00a0\nand now I'm gonna take the other color the one\u00a0\u00a0\nthat is the mommy one on a slightly bigger\u00a0\nbrush and I'm just putting that next to it\u00a0\u00a0\npretty straightforward pretty simple and I'm\u00a0\nputting it all the way up into the crease\u00a0\u00a0\nand then with the side it doesn't really\u00a0\nhave any product on it again I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\njust use a little bit to blend this edge here so\u00a0\nI've just gently Blended these together but you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan still see that the darkest part is out\u00a0\nhere and now I'm just taking a clean brush\u00a0\u00a0\nlike this and I'm taking that pastely one in\u00a0\nthe down corner this one and I'm putting that\u00a0\u00a0\non the lid and I'm also putting it up in the\u00a0\ncrease so you're doing one row with dark one\u00a0\u00a0\nrow with middle one row with light and then you\u00a0\njust gently blend them together and it's going\u00a0\u00a0\nto give you such an eye-opening look because\u00a0\nyou are so light here in the inner part so\u00a0\u00a0\nit's just going to be really brightening\u00a0\nand then we're gonna of course do the same\u00a0\u00a0\non the lower lash line too so we're literally\u00a0\nnot going to put any darkness in this part I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink it is just so pretty and I think it gives\u00a0\njust such a beautiful effortless and just awake\u00a0\u00a0\nlook while still being a little dramatic and you\u00a0\nonly use three colors but it looks a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nmore advanced right and I'm just gonna do the\u00a0\nexact same here on the lower lash line too so a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle dark out here just putting a little drama\u00a0\nand then the mid color we're doing in the middle\u00a0\u00a0\nand then in with the light shade and I like to\u00a0\nuse a little extra of the light shade because\u00a0\u00a0\nI think that really opens it up and you know how I\u00a0\nlove a pastel a pastel mat um it just has my heart\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one is a little sheer but I still\u00a0\nthink it really does its job look at that\u00a0\u00a0\nlook at that eye look really really liking\u00a0\nthat I'm gonna put some maybe baby pink\u00a0\u00a0\nand the in the waterline just\u00a0\nbouncing a little bit on this\u00a0\u00a0\nedge here and then I'm gonna finish the look up\u00a0\nI love that look at that look are you looking\nI feel like my nephew my my brother's son when he\u00a0\nwas starting to talk he didn't speak that much he\u00a0\u00a0\nalso has autism so all he said was look at this\u00a0\nlook at this look at this but in Swedish he would\u00a0\u00a0\njust say Cola Cola Cola Cola that's all he said\u00a0\nand I feel like I'm like that right now look at\u00a0\u00a0\nit look at it look at it I think it's pretty easy\u00a0\nfor me to say that I preferred this look more than\u00a0\u00a0\nI prefer the other look I like the other look too\u00a0\nbut I really love this look and this is giving me\u00a0\u00a0\nthat contrast that I was kind of hoping that\u00a0\nthis was going to give me two and even when I\u00a0\u00a0\nlooked at the palettes I mean I could definitely\u00a0\nnotice that there was more contrast in this cooler\u00a0\u00a0\npalette than was in the warmer palette but I\u00a0\ndidn't think that it was going to be that much\u00a0\u00a0\nof a difference on the eyes because I feel like\u00a0\ndefinitely with this one this middle shade will\u00a0\u00a0\nonly be a highlighter shade on you if you have\u00a0\nlike a tanned deep skin tone other than that\u00a0\u00a0\nit might just blend into your skin it definitely\u00a0\nis not lighter than my skin tone and I would say\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I am light to medium but I really do like\u00a0\nthis palette and I love how everything Blended\u00a0\u00a0\ntogether the pasta was a little thin but I was\u00a0\nable to build it up and I can definitely see it\u00a0\u00a0\non the eyes right now overall I think that both\u00a0\nof these palettes are good quality but I will say\u00a0\u00a0\nthe way that those cream Shadows creased on me I\u00a0\nhave not had anything crease like that on my eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nsince the XX Revolution eyeshadows like that was\u00a0\nintense so I need to figure out what I did wrong\u00a0\u00a0\nor if there is another way like that I can\u00a0\nuse these or if they just do not work on me\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause again I'm 39 my eyes do definitely\u00a0\nhave some creases and the folds with time\u00a0\u00a0\num if I need to use them without a primer is if\u00a0\nI use need to use them with your finger maybe a\u00a0\u00a0\nthinner layer like what I need to do because\u00a0\nthey definitely the way that they apply they\u00a0\u00a0\nare a little similar to the Natasha denona\u00a0\ncream to powder but not the way they were oh\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Natasha denona cream to powder they are on\u00a0\nme budge proof they dry down like a powder and\u00a0\u00a0\nthey are on for forever like I literally\u00a0\nwore them to my to my own wedding because\u00a0\u00a0\nI knew that I could trust that formula this one\u00a0\ncreased within like three hours and I just yeah\u00a0\u00a0\nI need to finish with that a little bit more\u00a0\nper usual a first impression is all fine and\u00a0\u00a0\ndandy we always need to try stuff out a little\u00a0\nbit more before we give our final thoughts but\u00a0\u00a0\nat least this is me sharing some thoughts\u00a0\nwith you after using it after wearing it\u00a0\u00a0\nfor at least a little bit and hopefully you\u00a0\ngot some inspiration of how you can do some\u00a0\u00a0\nsimple all matte looks if that is something that\u00a0\nyou're interested in and if you liked the video\u00a0\u00a0\nplease do consider subscribing and giving this\u00a0\nvideo a thumbs up that really does help out I\u00a0\u00a0\nhope you're having an amazing day and I will see\u00a0\nyou again tomorrow for a new makeup releases bye\nforeign [Music] [Applause]\n[Music]",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

Let's get started!\nFirst things first, always wear sunscreen.\u00a0\nThis one from Etude House is my holy grail.\nI\u2019m trying this e.l.f. Luminous Putty Primer to\u00a0\u00a0\ngive my skin a subtle glow.\u00a0\nSo far, I really like it.\nOf course, I\u2019m using my under eye corrector from\u00a0\u00a0\nBecca. This stuff works so well\u00a0\nat correcting my dark circles.\nFor this look, I want to let my skin shine,\u00a0\nso I\u2019m concealing very intentionally,\u00a0\u00a0\nonly placing dots where I need them the most.\u00a0\nAnd I make sure to blend it out really well.\nAnd you know I had to double it. Of\u00a0\ncourse concealing twice because I'm tired!\nThis is my go-to cushion foundation. It gives\u00a0\u00a0\nmy skin such a beautiful dewy\u00a0\nfinish and is so easy to apply.\nTo keep this look glowy, I\u2019m only setting\u00a0\nunder my eyes and on my T-zone. Then I\u2019m\u00a0\u00a0\ntaking a brush and just doing a very\u00a0\nlight dusting on the rest of my face.\nFor eyes, I\u2019m using my Naked3 palette and taking\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shade \u201cLimit\u201d to apply a\u00a0\nwash of color on my eyelids.\nWith the shade \u201cNooner,\u201d I\u2019m depositing it\u00a0\nright in the outer corner and blending it\u00a0\u00a0\nout with a fluffy brush. I\u2019m also taking that\u00a0\nsame color on my lower eyelid for more depth.\nI\u2019m going in with this Stila Liquid\u00a0\nEyeshadow on the inner and center\u00a0\u00a0\nparts of my eye and blending it\u00a0\nwith my finger. And I apply a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle bit at a time because I know\u00a0\nI can always add more if I need to.\nNow it\u2019s time for the big guns. I\u2019m using this\u00a0\u00a0\nglitter liquid eyeshadow to give my\u00a0\neyes that jelly, glass-like effect.\nFor eyeliner, I\u2019m using this brown liner and doing\u00a0\na very small wing, starting with the tail and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen drawing only up to the halfway point of my\u00a0\nlash line. This keeps my eyes looking more open.\nI\u2019ve always been a Doe Lashes girl.\u00a0\nI\u2019ve had this pair for so long because\u00a0\u00a0\nI prefer the 1.0 design. I really wish\u00a0\nDoe still made their lashes like this.\nI\u2019m going to take that same brown\u00a0\nliner and fill in the gap between\u00a0\u00a0\nthe band and my inner corner just so\u00a0\nthat there\u2019s not an empty space there.\nI love the tiny wand on this mascara because it\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0\ngreat for doing my bottom lashes,\u00a0\nwhich are literally nonexistent.\nI\u2019m using this clear brow gel from Benefit and\u00a0\napplying it to my brows to give them that \u201cwet\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nlook. Then I\u2019m just filling them in very lightly\u00a0\nbecause I want to keep them looking natural.\nI just bought this cream blush from\u00a0\nFenty and I\u2019m already in love with it.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis is the shade \u201cStrawberry Drip\u201d\u00a0\nand it compliments my skin so well.\nFor highlighter, I\u2019m using this silvery\u00a0\none from ColourPop and applying it\u00a0\u00a0\ngenerously to my cheek bones.

Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

        "transcript_text": "hello It's Annabelle [Music]\nto find in this new program video I discover a new\neye shadow palette from the LHS cosmetics brand and this little palette is called labrakech this palette\nI found it on the Beauty website Bay so for the people who follow me well I'm going to\nharp on those who have just arrived beauty B has just arrived in the\nUnited Arab Emirates for deliveries I placed my order I waited more than 15 days for delivery when\nwhen I placed my order I got a great discount but the problem is that I had\ncustoms fees which were much more expensive than the discount I got when I placed my order\nso I was a little annoyed but hey I'm discovering new brands that are finally\navailable to me so well here we go eh we'll say that I'm very very very happy with my order anyway\nI can't wait to discover this palette of 9 headlights then you will see it is already a\nlittle bit dirty because I did my swatches I prepared my swatches so it's 9 headlights\nheadlights matte headlights bright here are the swatches so she's very very\ntrendy 2023 there's blue there's blue a little purple there's has gray that will turn\nthe purple into blue I love the proposals of this palette for info you can use it\nby taking three headlights vertically or three times horizontally or what you gold to\nsimplify your life the pigmentation for the Swatch well it's really not bad I put them in\nthe order of the palette so you have a very nice champagne here it is bright then a kind\nof small chess I don't know if you will see a kind of small pink parma pink with small\nreflections a little blue a nice pink Parma very beautiful pigmentation is magnificent\nmatte sky blue blue and a nice beige here is an essential color in a palette a nice beige\nI don't think I'm going to use it today and then this lighthouse there which in the in the dan s the\nlittle one in the little pad seems very navy blue but in fact it's a bright purple navy blue\nthen you have this color there that we say looks like a gray but in fact it's not\na simple metallic gray it's is a chrome duo with purplish pink and blue colors so\ncompletely adapted to the 2023 fashion then you have a magnificent dark gray which has a beautiful\npigmentation and a nice black then the black to put practice to make swatches I can\ntell you that the black it has crazy pigmentation and an outfit frankly you can't wipe it\nwith a simple little wipe you really have to come and wash your hands with soap\nbecause otherwise it won't go away here is this palette I find it very very nice\ncardboard packaging a square mirror inside nothing is missing the colors are beautiful\nI'll see you in a few seconds well without make-up here you find me without\neye make-up let's go for the discovery of this palette I don't know yet what I'm going\nto do for you but in any case I'm going to try to offer you something that will change me a little bit\nso I don't really know but well we'll see I'm going to start with my transition color I\nI'm going to try this little weapon color with this brush so of course I had applied\nmy A\u00efcha must insurance base from Too Faced it's a little cold transition color\na little bit Parma pigmentation and there I really like the colors\nwell, listen, I don't see them anyway, which is super practical, it's the mirror,\nbut hey, I'll try to find them on the internet and we'll see if I\nfind them, I'll put them to you as I go. application I do\nthe same on the other side I really like this color which is a little cold a little Parma\nit goes quite well with the headlights Ben and there I cosmetic that I applied in blush\nI do the same I apply this color there flush with the eyelashes while I like that it's done\nwith a brush it's perfect here\nyou go next so you'll probably hear trucks passing by cars I\n'm out of air conditioning and my window is open okay what am I going to apply\nothers now I'm going to apply this navy blue a little bit purple in the corner\nwe'll see if that I haven't changed boat I haven't changed boat\nI hope I won't have any fall in any case it works very well it settles well I\ndon't know if I'm going to use the black of the palette we'll see it's more of a Parma I'd say a\nnavy but it's still very pretty I intensify my eyelid crease well with this color\nc it's not bad at all I like the rendering the intensity is pretty I think it's colors\nthat are amply adjustable I do the same on the other side here is the\nouter corner is made with this so in the palette I would say it looks like a slightly\npurple navy on my eyelids it still looks more like purple so I\nwanted blue because it's the fashion for blue 2023 well it's a little cooked I could have\nused this beige in transition color but it's a little too banal here's what am I going to\napply now I'm going to come and intensify my c external oin with this gray color in fact\nhere is to restore a little more intensity I will still take\nanother brush a little bit finer to really delimit my external corner a little more\nI'm going slowly because I have afraid of having falls\nthere is a nice intensification on the other hand I wonder if I have it I have not just had falls\nI do the same on the other side it's really pretty I like the rendering and indeed with\nthis gray and this purple well me I find that it's intensifies and it brings\nout the blue of this color I like it a lot then I'm in the grids\nI'm going to come and apply this metallic gray to the finger which has a\nbeautiful touch which is very pleasant and I just apply it in the middle of my eyelid\nso it's a gray in the palette but we have a little color which is\nwhich is in the Blues in fact it's a gray blue which is really very very pretty I like\nI like it's fine it settles well it's [Music]\nit's nice here I applied this gray-blue color in the center of the eyelids a little\nbit wider on the outsides to be able to use a maximum of it\nthen good good we have a little white a little lambda we have a little also pink\n[Music] and we have a pretty blue so I'm going to use this blue\nhere with a brush that's a bit bally a little bit short and I'm going to come\nI'm going to come and do this space there in matte blue so yes it works\nit's very pretty this awesome\nintensifyable blue\ntake my brush from the very beginning that I rub on a small cloth\nand I'm going to patinate the transition between the luminous color and this blue\nit's very pretty I like it a lot we're actually talking about a one tone little bit\npurple and the closer we get to the internal point in fact and well we become blue\nhere I do the same on the other side here I applied the light blue color\nrather to the internal corner but not really internal corner since I will come pick up\nwith a small brush a small sty brush lo like this then white that would be\nthat to bring out I was tempted to use this color yes\nbut it's a little more in the palms pulling a little on the blue parmes\nit's a little bit bright or so I play it safe and I use white\nmy heart is balanced I didn't make you a white side one side whatever come on\nI'm going to make an internal corner of a white side\npigmentation it settles really well\nI put a little the background in the blue\nput a tiny bit of it at the end of the thread look at the pigmentation it gives off beautiful beautiful beautiful\nfind that this palette good I'm cleaning my brush so that there's no\nwhite left on it and I'm going to come and take it to do the on the other side see\nwhat it looks like this little pale pink a bit [Music] a bit multi chrome I would say\ngood but I did well to test it\nbecause it also matches very very well we bring back a bit of Parma that we added\nthat we like to apply here and the color applies really superbly\nhere it is done j I really like the result I have a little weakness\nfor this side with the inner corner really a little pink multichrome it's\nfine the colors work superbly well I really like the result\nnow I'm going to have to finish my lash line I'm going to try this little brush\nI'm going keep this bun I hesitate\nI'm going to come and intensify my outer corner flush with the eyelash with the famous purple navy blue\nto retune it a little bit like that\nit works too well frankly this palette is a beautiful beautiful\ndiscovery here I am stepped up i'm going to keep my granny maybe the\nsame brush i'm coming to clean it well because it's very thin and i like it\ni'm going to use the cleanest side i'm going to pick up no i'm going to change\nmy little ball brush that I used to apply the light blue and I with the\nlight blue I'm going to come and try to do a little central touch in my eyelash line\nto bring back a little\nlight and it works really well I'm going to come and pull them a whole small t little\ntowards the inner corner and here I am not going to touch more I am going to apply my my mascara\nof the moment the beauty green here I am finished I applied so my mascara in test this month the\ndream beauty volume I like a lot a lot the rendering of this palette look at the colors are\nsuper fine they can be intensified I had a very small drop there when I\napplied the dark gray this one but the colors are fine it's modular c it's really super\npretty it's very trendy 2023 I admit I really like this sky blue and yet it's\nnot necessarily my color it was not necessarily my favorite color but in any case with\nthis mixture of gray of Parma of purple and this blue it's just beautiful the little white side well I\nthink it's very nice but with this pink side also in the inner corner it's also\nvery very fine it carries a little something extra d a little less classic\nthe fact of reapplying a little wheat a sky level with eyelashes and well it immediately gives a boost a boost\na sunburn a stroke of spring that will happen yeah the colors are\nnot super super bright for example but for example I am thinking of this one in this case that\nI applied here but I can perhaps get wet it would have been more flamboyant but I find\nthat on my eyelids which mark a little bit sometimes with certain headlights well there it was not going\nat all it's the end and I really like this make-up here I used quite a few colors\nI used this one this one this one this one this one this one and this gray well well finally there\nis only two colors that I didn't use beige that can be used as a transition color\nbut that's it, it's a bit seen and black beats black it still has a great pigmentation\nand frankly for someone who knows how to look well look at the intense black what\nin any case here is for someone who knows how to master the line of eyeliner with a brush this\ncolor must be just hot I hope in any case that you will have liked this video\nif so don't forget the little blue thumbs up it's more than fun if\nyou don't it's not done yet well don't wait any longer subscribe it's a

Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

        "transcript_text": "[Music] hola Welcome or Welcome back to a\nnew video \uc548\ub155\ud558\uc138\uc694(an-nyeong-ha-se-yo)\nSo today we're with a haul video because I\nwent to oliveyoung to get something because\nthere's discounts up to 70% off and for those\nwho don't know oliveyoung here is like Sephora\nin Italy so you can find inside a lot of Skin\nCare Brands, make up and so much more so I\nwould say to start right away right away right\naway I bought just something also because\nnot knowing the Brands yet I just want to\ntry them and test them So I would say to start\nSo inside here are the contents Don't mind\nthe bag because I had this with me behind\nThis is from Daiso\nand nothing so my swag is inside here because\nhere you pay for the bags separately otherwise\nSo let's start with the first thing I wanted\nto try which was this one right here\nand it is the Clean it by Banila Co this product\nhere which is\na facial cleanser It should remove both makeup\n, dead cells, sebum ,waste and other So it\nshould also have a purifying action and this\nspecifically is the cleansing Balm with purifying\neffect then there are also different types\nnow I don't remember well but for sure , because\nI remember there are various colors of this\nMakeup Remover Balm , there are also patches\nto remove makeup but I wanted to try this\none so once you\nyou apply it to your face it should remove\nall the makeup and then you just rinse off\nthe packaging inside\ntwo\ntwo creams one smaller one 25 ml and the other\none is supposed to be just the regular size\nand in Korea here you often find a package\nlike that so you buy the cream or anyway the\nSkincare product that you're interested in\n, very often you find the packages where they\ngive you either a smaller cream that is always\nthe same product or some other thing for you\nto try it together so it's something that\nyou see often in Korea at Olive Young\nnow we're going to open it...the texture should\nbe sherbet and it should have its own applicator\nOkay So this is the cream the little one 25\nml package then inside we have\nThe big package which is instead ...it doesn't\nsay.\n100 ml okay The big package is 100 ml and\ninside is the cover for this one here for\nthe big one and the little spatula\nNow I'm going to try to open the little one\nand see\nSo this one is very ..I thought it was more\ngelatinous instead it looks more like a butter\nvery solid you see not runny or anything\nI will try it and then I will let you know\nfor sure how working . I interested that it\nremoves makeup well because for example with\nthe mascara I use that skyhigh This one here\nfrom Maybelline Yes I brought it with me from\nItaly\nit is quite difficult to remove makeup so\nI have to test for this I don't have the receipt\nwith me because then precisely decide not\nto take it but I found on the site the official\nprice should be 18 but I paid 11,000 won actually\nalmost 12,000 won\nThe second skincare product that I got is\nthis cream from Abib the brand is this here\nand it is supposed to be a moisturizer with\ncalming action and it is also supposed to\nstrengthen is skin barrier so it is supposed\nto restore damaged skin , also this pack is\na 2 pack so inside we find an 80 cream and\nan 80 cream this here they are not different\nbut they have the same amount inside\nhere it is\none and two\nthey are here\nthese and let's go to see the texture of these\nones ah she also has the little spatula to\ntake it and\nA classic cream like texture but the smell\nI don't know\nit's so weird\ni really don't know\nthe feeling is very comfortable it almost\nfeels like I'm putting water I have to tell\nthe truth on my hand really really nice texture\nReally it feels watery I mean\nit looks good , I'll let you know about this\none too but for now\nthe texture and how I feel it on the skin\n....also I feel it very fresh it looks good\nhopefully it will do what it's supposed to.\nthis package also I looked it up on the internet\nand it was at 35,000 Won I paid 23,000 and\nso great this one too actually Anyway let's\nmove on to the last skincare product which\nis this one here also as you can see this\none consists of a set so this is the main\ncream and these here are the little gifts\nthat they give you\nThis one in particular is a company that\nhas vegan products and it's cruelty free for\nsure\nand let's see what's inside then this cream\nactually is supposed to have the Cica effect\nas you can see it's supposed to restore the\nskin so through centella asiatica which is\nthe main component of this cream and anyway\nof this line in general because even the serum,\nthe masks these things like that have centella\nasiatica inside\nthe serum is a soothing, the cream is supposed\nto help the skin regenerate itself have this\nCica effect ...because of this they call the\n5D which would be the Five different cica\nso different acids inside and centella asiatica\nAsiaticoside which is supposed to be\nthe one that is for maintaining the 'elasticity\nof the skin so it should just help very very\nmuch the skin almost kind of an anti-aging\nI don't know so\nthis is very promising\ninside this box contains the cream has precisely\nsize 80 ml then we have another small cream\n20 ml the serum 10 and in addition it gives\nyou a mask so Super Top ..with one box you\nhave practically four products . let's open\nHere this is how it shows just opened So first\nof all there is the cream\nso\nwith behind it says Your Skin is your Planet\nalso Clean & Vegan Easy off Label\nthe cream ,this also has its spatula ..I think\nI see a spatula I don't know\noh this has the strangest smell I almost don't\nlike it actually however we don't care in\nI mean the smell comes later\nthe texture is this here\nthen\nlet's see\nHow do I do it\nHere it is .. then this should be the serum\nThis is the serum 10 ml is a few however let's\nsay the serum it's not that it takes an exaggerated\namount for the serum Ah it has the spout like\nthis the dispenser like this so it's as well\neasy to take a not exaggerated amount .. then\nanother\ncream\nHere it is the little one 20 ml.\nthis maybe I don't know on a trip easy to\ncarry in short And then and then\nHere it is this should probably be\nthe little spatula to take it ..it has a pretty\nstrange shape\npretty weird though this is the spatula and\nif I can I would like to show you the mask\nOk so after destroying the box this is the\nmask\nBalanceful Cica Mask\nOf course always centella asiatica extract\nso\nThis is really the mask I can really feel\nit full of liquid inside\ntop top top we like it and then ..this set\nhere cost 24 instead I paid almost 17,000\nWon and\nHopefully these little products will do their\njob .. then I will let you know I will update\nyou over time.\nIn another purchase made from Olive Young\nI got these two lipsticks from Lily by Red\nI had already purchased two of these previously\nhowever one is always similar to this so mousse\neffect while the other has a more Juicy effect\nThese are the two colors I wanted to take\nthe 12 and the 13\nthe 12 obviously warmer more orangey while\nthe 13 has a more\nprobably autumnal however I don't care I put\nlipsticks on regardless of the seasons in\nshort if I feel like it I just put it on period\nthen anyway they are not....\nthey are quite manageable in the sense that\nif they are dabbed they lose a little color\nand only leave the effect of tinted lips so\nthey \nare \nquite blendable ..it's not \nthat they are strong colors you say Ah but\nnow come spring or I \ndon't know the color too dark No because you\nsimply can dab them on and the result is beautiful\nthe same\nthese are the packages ..here they are I love\nthis Mat effect I love them and just behind\nyou can see the writing\nof these I made \na reel on Instagram so you can see the two\ncolors on the Instagram reel\nI recommend follow me there too and\nthey are really really beautiful I haven't\ntried them on my lips yet however this particular\ncolor when I tried to remove it has a nice\nhold\nLet's say that I already with the others...with\nthe mousse always from Lilly by Red I'm doing\npretty well I can eat obviously decently and\nit stays on so maybe if you want I'll also\ndo a test and keep you updated to see the\ndurability of these products these or anyway\nwhat I already had previously...and nothing\nfor now these are my lipsticks ..my favorite\nlip tints actually\nand nothing maybe I will make a video where\nI try my makeup with the Korean products I\nhave ..so we will see if you like the final\neffect ..and nothing\nI hope that \nI have entertained you for a while\nthat you liked the video especially if you\nwant to see some other things specifically\n..write it in the comments and I will try\nto accommodate you if you want to see some\nproducts specifically or test some things\ntogether\nyou let me know\nI thank you for watching this video see you\nin a next video stay tuned\nand \uc548\ub155\ud558\uc138\uc694 (an-nyeong-ha-se-yo) Bye",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

Fenty highlighter and I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nso excited because I love a good celebrity brand\u00a0\nand especially a good highlighter so let's start\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna start off with a highlighter by rem\u00a0\nBeauty which is called Interstellar highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\ntopper and the one that I've got is in the shade\u00a0\nmiss venus this one retails at selfridges \u00a0\u00a0\nfor 20 pounds and obviously on Sephora for 25\u00a0\npounds which I think is pretty good in the USA\u00a0\u00a0\nI think it's 22 dollars so obviously kind of\u00a0\nthe same price I must tell you I really love\u00a0\u00a0\nthe packaging it feels really sturdy and it\u00a0\nfeels like good quality I love the fact that\u00a0\u00a0\noh it's magnetic and this is how it looks inside\u00a0\nI hope this highlighter thing is my shade like\u00a0\u00a0\nI love a good magnet and let's just do a little\u00a0\nSwatch and see how it's like and this is how it\u00a0\u00a0\nlooks on my hand it's a little bit yellowish if\u00a0\nI'm being honest like another all the shades but\u00a0\u00a0\nI quite like it wow look at this highlighter this\u00a0\nis beautiful oh my God look at that so I feel like\u00a0\u00a0\nthis type of yellow sort of shade highlighter is\u00a0\nnot necessarily for my skin tone but I quite like\u00a0\u00a0\nit not gonna lie I think I owned a highlighter\u00a0\nlike this ages ago and yeah yeah I like it it's no\u00a0\u00a0\nchunky it's very subtle it's very very beautiful\u00a0\nit's very pigmented it's very sheer sort of like\u00a0\u00a0\nnot very yeah yeah this is mwah love it I mean\u00a0\nyes yes Ariana you did it so well I've heard many\u00a0\u00a0\nthings about it and people saying like meh it's\u00a0\nnot there or anything like that but I am impressed\u00a0\u00a0\nthe next one we are gonna try this bad boy from\u00a0\nFenty Beauty which is called killawatt freestyler\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlighter Duo this one is in the shade well\u00a0\nit's two shades obviously and they are called\u00a0\u00a0\nLightning Dust and fire Crystal this one is one of\u00a0\nmy all-time favorites I mean you could tell that\u00a0\u00a0\nI've been using it quite a lot and it's one of the\u00a0\nbest highlighters out of there it retails at boots\u00a0\u00a0\nfor 29 pounds which I think is pretty alright for\u00a0\na high-end highlighter let's do a little Swatch I\u00a0\u00a0\nknow obviously the shades are very very different\u00a0\nI didn't take in the calculation that rem one is more\u00a0\u00a0\nfor dark skin tones but that's okay so this is the\u00a0\nREM Beauty one and this is Rihanna's  obviously\u00a0\u00a0\nRihanna's is more brighter it's less yellowish\u00a0\nand it's much more better for my skin tone I\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't know why I'm showing you my middle finger\u00a0\nthis one is Lightning Dust by Fenty Beauty as well\u00a0\u00a0\nthey all look very pretty now now let's top the\u00a0\nface with a Fenty one I've been using a lot and\u00a0\u00a0\nit's so bloody beautiful it feels like my face is\u00a0\nwet like the effect is absolutely insane it's so\u00a0\u00a0\ngorgeous a little bit on the nose as well because\u00a0\nwe love a little bit of nice glaze effect\nso this is the rem Beauty\nthis is Fanty Beauty\nthe rem highlighter topper is made in Italy and\u00a0\nit has 8 grams while the Fenty Beauty one is\u00a0\u00a0\nmade in Canada and it has 3.5 grams two shades and\u00a0\nI think this is a plus because you get two shades\u00a0\u00a0\nhere while this one is just one big shade I mean\u00a0\nI think you need to really calculate and see which\u00a0\u00a0\nshade you like the most from rem Beauty because\u00a0\nyou're quite limited to one shade while I feel\u00a0\u00a0\nlike this is definitely a plus with two shades\u00a0\nbasically for me rem Beauty wins when it comes\u00a0\u00a0\nto the packaging because I love this packaging\u00a0\nI don't know if it's metallic or anything but\u00a0\u00a0\nas I said it feels pretty sturdy has a magnetic\u00a0\nclose here you can do a little ASMR  as well\u00a0\u00a0\nbut yeah this wins for me in terms of\u00a0\nlike packaging price wise

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

I just\u00a0\npulled a bunch of makeup that I really wanted\u00a0\u00a0\nto be using from my collection and I am going to\u00a0\nbe discussing this new trend of the influencing\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I really don't feel is like giving the\u00a0\nkind of energy that people think they're gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nbe giving like it's it's not the flex that\u00a0\npeople think it is that's maybe that could\u00a0\u00a0\nbe the whole thing about this video and if you\u00a0\nhaven't been here before do consider subscribing\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I do upload quite a lot of videos\u00a0\nevery week all about makeup all about beauty\nbecause I want to try I want to try this new\u00a0\nprimer this even has the sticker still on I bought\u00a0\u00a0\nthis when I was at Target the other day with my\u00a0\nhusband this is the new NYX freezy cooling primer\u00a0\u00a0\nand moisturizing base this is supposed to be I\u00a0\nlove like something that's cooling a cooling Lippy\u00a0\u00a0\na cooling primer a cooling mask I'm all about that\u00a0\nlive this doesn't smell like much maybe a little\u00a0\u00a0\nminty it looks like a gel but like a little bit\u00a0\nalmost like Frosty gel like not 100 see-through\u00a0\u00a0\nis it cooling because I didn't put this in\u00a0\u00a0\nI didn't put this in the fridge it says to not\u00a0\nuse it too close to the eyes so let's not do that\nnot really at least not right now I'll\u00a0\nleave it on for a couple of minutes and\u00a0\u00a0\nreport back but it's not as cooling as that\u00a0\nlike mask that I like to use let me actually\u00a0\u00a0\nbring that one that one if you really\u00a0\nlike a cooling kick in the morning that\u00a0\u00a0\nis a gel mask that is a wash off hydrating\u00a0\nwake up mask absolutely love it and it's\u00a0\u00a0\nalso very affordable this has a little\u00a0\nbit of a cooling sensation but honestly\u00a0\u00a0\nnothing to write home about okay so this is the\u00a0\nmask that I am talking about this is the I'm green\u00a0\u00a0\ntea Hydro burst morning mask by Tony moly I will\u00a0\nlink this down below this is also a jelly mask\u00a0\u00a0\nit smells very fresh not minty just like herbally\u00a0\nfresh just smells like fresh skincare to be honest\u00a0\u00a0\nand you put it on your skin you leave it on for a\u00a0\nbit and this isn't actually cooling experience you\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't have to put it in the fridge or anything\u00a0\nsuch a nice mask if you like me live in a warm\u00a0\u00a0\nand humid climate and just want to have something\u00a0\nto just cool down your skin a little bit in the\u00a0\u00a0\nmorning time so definitely recommend it I will\u00a0\nleave it down below this this primer it leaves\u00a0\u00a0\nthe skin a little tacky it might be great for I\u00a0\ndon't know for a primer but I don't know about\u00a0\u00a0\nthis freezy claim maybe you do need to put it on\u00a0\nin the fridge to make that work I have no idea\nFoundation shade is I mean it's\u00a0\npretty good for my shoulder you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan tell that I've been self-tanning\u00a0\nbut not so much in my face but yeah\u00a0\u00a0\nI think this is gonna sort itself out so this is\u00a0\nthe influencing Trend you know what I thought when\u00a0\u00a0\nI heard it let me just quickly talk a little\u00a0\nbit about the influencing the the trend or\u00a0\u00a0\nthe term of the influencing kinda recently Rose\u00a0\nto popularity on Tick Tock I don't know exactly\u00a0\u00a0\nthrough which Tick Tock influencer but somebody\u00a0\ngot the bright idea to instead of talking about\u00a0\u00a0\ninfluencing talking about D influencing which I've\u00a0\nsaid this before but if you've been around for\u00a0\u00a0\na longer cycle on like YouTube and social media\u00a0\nthis is not something new this whole idea of like\u00a0\u00a0\ninstead of telling people what to buy we would\u00a0\nbe more telling people what not to buy or like\u00a0\u00a0\ntalking them out of stuff and Tick Tock literally\u00a0\nis just going through the exact same cycle as\u00a0\u00a0\nYouTube and Instagram did but maybe more in 2016\u00a0\n2000 like 17 where I will say that the makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nCommunity was a little bit in shambles after a\u00a0\nlot of like shady practices was brought to light\u00a0\u00a0\nand a lot of people that had not been disclosing\u00a0\nwhen they were sponsored or when they were using\u00a0\u00a0\naffiliate links it was kind of just brought to\u00a0\neveryone's attention that maybe not everyone was\u00a0\u00a0\nplaying a fair game this is definitely a shade\u00a0\nto dark for me right now laughs fascinating\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah definitely a shade to dark uh this one is\u00a0\nin light medium sand but I think this is going\u00a0\u00a0\nto be good when I have a 10 but right now it is\u00a0\na shade too dark so I'm definitely going to be\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlighting a little bit with this concealer\u00a0\nthat is a little lighter but when I saw this\u00a0\u00a0\nwhole trend of the influencing I couldn't\u00a0\nhelp but giggle a little bit and just think\u00a0\u00a0\nto myself oh I guess the tick tock kids finally\u00a0\nrealized that you don't have to like everything\u00a0\u00a0\nyou don't have to like all makeup you\u00a0\ncan actually not like something and just\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know be honest when you don't like something\u00a0\nbecause I feel like Tick Tock for a little while\u00a0\u00a0\nwas just filled with overly positive reviews I\u00a0\nwant to call it demonstrations of people that was\u00a0\u00a0\njust like hoping to go viral hoping to be noticed\u00a0\nby Brands hoping to make a living hoping to just\u00a0\u00a0\nbe the new Michaela and I really am grateful to\u00a0\nsee that people are realizing that you can just\u00a0\u00a0\nnot like something as well but I remember and\u00a0\nwhen was this when Kimberly Clark became very\u00a0\u00a0\npopular with the anti-hauls it was basically\u00a0\nlike the antidote to the constant hauling of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe OG Beauty gurus because they were doing Hall\u00a0\nafter Hall after Hall telling people you need this\u00a0\u00a0\nrandom walk I am obsessed you absolutely need\u00a0\nto be trying this out you should go and buy it\u00a0\u00a0\nright now not fully disclosing what has been\u00a0\nsent to them what they bought themselves what\u00a0\u00a0\nthey have affiliate codes with what they have\u00a0\naffiliate links with and it was just all a blur of\u00a0\u00a0\nundisclosed monetization back in the day this kind\u00a0\nof rose to the surface people were not having it\u00a0\u00a0\nat all and with Kimberly Clark which unfortunately\u00a0\nshe does not upload anymore came a wave of more\u00a0\u00a0\num anti-consumerism and just being a little bit\u00a0\nmore open to saying you know what I don't want\u00a0\u00a0\nthis I am actually not at all interested in\u00a0\nthis release we don't need to buy absolutely\u00a0\u00a0\neverything it is okay to look at something and\u00a0\nbe like I don't need it I don't want it thank\u00a0\u00a0\nyou very much next and I don't know what it is\u00a0\nabout Tick Tock and the absolute resistance to\u00a0\u00a0\nreusing a term or reusing a concept they have to\u00a0\nrename everything so now what we used to call an\u00a0\u00a0\nanti-haul is now called the influencing but\u00a0\nI don't think that they're doing it correctly\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause what they're calling the influencing\u00a0\nI would just call an honest review oh my God\u00a0\u00a0\nthis Foundation is so sticky but I want to use a\u00a0\nlittle bit of I'm gonna use this bronzer palette\u00a0\u00a0\nor like Contra bronzer palette before I do\u00a0\nsome powder but I'm gonna have to powder my\u00a0\u00a0\nentire face because I am fly paper I Have Become\u00a0\nfly paper the ultimate packet and I usually will\u00a0\u00a0\nsay that I am the kind of person that on numerous\u00a0\noccasions have called out both people viewers and\u00a0\u00a0\ninfluencers creators for having this way of seeing\u00a0\nnegative people as being honest and positive\u00a0\u00a0\npeople as just lying or exaggerating when I know\u00a0\nfor a hacked that that is definitely a two-way\u00a0\u00a0\nstreet there is a lot of people that will jump\u00a0\non a bandwagon and do a overly negative review\u00a0\u00a0\njust because it gets views or just because they\u00a0\nknow that it will get viewers to trust them more\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen it comes to other things so I definitely\u00a0\nthink that that probably also has been used\u00a0\u00a0\nby some people during this the influencing\u00a0\ntrend on Tick Tock where people have been\u00a0\u00a0\nposting stuff that is grabbing attention for\u00a0\na reason like dog hairs are stuck to my face\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is my truth now so I'm gonna be diving in\u00a0\nI have the eyeshadow palette and the holographic\u00a0\u00a0\nliquid Shadows here as well this is the\u00a0\nValentine's collection by glass guards I\u00a0\u00a0\nwill link this down below I'm gonna be wearing\u00a0\none of the liquid blushes in Bay which is this\u00a0\u00a0\nlike Peach glasgots is a Swedish in the brand\u00a0\nand I will link them down below in case you're\u00a0\u00a0\ninterested in them I have not tried these blushes\u00a0\nbefore and I was getting a lot of feedback from\u00a0\u00a0\nyou wanting me to try them out there is\u00a0\nliterally more hair here I am going crazy\u00a0\u00a0\nthat is more pigmented than\u00a0\nI thought it was going to be\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't like a big blush placement and\u00a0\nI definitely do not like blush down here\u00a0\u00a0\nand definitely not on my nose that is really\u00a0\nbeautiful it's a little bit more on the sheer side\nso let me see if we can build just a little\u00a0\nbit more right here and I have no idea if this\u00a0\u00a0\nis going to dry down or not either so the\u00a0\ntrend the influencing definitely has taken\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent forms on the platform I'm even seeing\u00a0\ncreators on YouTube do the influencing videos\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich I see the influencing going in several\u00a0\ndifferent directions some are just like videos\u00a0\u00a0\nor tick tocks of people just complaining just\u00a0\nbeing Randy complainy rant listen nothing it\u00a0\u00a0\ngets views like rents if you can just be angry\u00a0\nonline you'll get the views people love seeing\u00a0\u00a0\nothers be even more Angry than they are it is\u00a0\nliterally the favorite pastime of some people so\u00a0\u00a0\nif you can build a career of being angry online\u00a0\nyou want to get the views you you won't get any\u00a0\u00a0\nsponsorships but you'll get the views for sure\u00a0\npeople don't even care if you're honest or not\u00a0\u00a0\nif you're angry online people are all about that\u00a0\nlife the other thing I see is people just kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't want to say coming clean but kind\u00a0\nof just admitting that something's online\u00a0\u00a0\njust really isn't as hyped as it is like been\u00a0\nmarketed as like this is a nice blush but it's\u00a0\u00a0\nnot all that this is a nice Foundation but it\u00a0\nisn't all that and that seems to be the second\u00a0\u00a0\none the third one is just people kind of telling\u00a0\nyou by This Not That which is not an anti-haul\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich is not the influencing that is just you\u00a0\ninfluencing in a different direction which is\u00a0\u00a0\nliterally the opposite of the influencing that\u00a0\nis just that's just you doing a buy this not\u00a0\u00a0\nthat that video ID already exists you don't need\u00a0\nto take over the influencing Trend to do that and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen the fourth one is people just giving honest\u00a0\nreviews of things they don't like and it is okay\u00a0\u00a0\nto not like everything I feel like on Tick Tock if\u00a0\nyou don't like it don't talk about it and I will\u00a0\u00a0\nsay while I a million percent agree that if you\u00a0\ndon't like someone you don't need to tell them and\u00a0\u00a0\nyou don't need to do the whole online world that\u00a0\nyou that you don't like them but when it comes to\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup it's not a person if you don't like the\u00a0\nmakeup and you actually think that you saying\u00a0\u00a0\nthat you don't like this might help your viewers\u00a0\nthat's just a review that's what a review is a\u00a0\u00a0\nreview is not you telling your viewers how much\u00a0\nyou love something if review is you telling your\u00a0\u00a0\nviewers when you like something when you don't\u00a0\nlike something and why because a lot of these D\u00a0\u00a0\ninfluencing Tech talks it's still just a instead\u00a0\nof saying I love this it's the best thing since\u00a0\u00a0\nsliced bread they're saying I hate this it's\u00a0\nthe worst thing since the plague and I'm like\u00a0\u00a0\nwhy can we know a why please I'm finally\u00a0\ngetting around to trying this Wayne Goss\u00a0\u00a0\nlippies I had a lip liner here in sepia which I\u00a0\ndon't think that this is a sepia color but I kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof like the color it's a little dark mauve\u00a0\nand then I have this Lippy it's this is not\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to match but we're using them together\u00a0\nthis is in nutmeg this is like a warm beige\nhmm and it actually goes pretty good together\u00a0\nit smells a little bit like old lipstick I got\u00a0\u00a0\nthese in my view delish lucky bag and this is\u00a0\nactually the first time I'm trying Wing glass\nyou know what that's really\u00a0\npretty I like the color\u00a0\u00a0\nI like the consistency a lot it's a little bit\u00a0\nlike a not a glossy but like a more of a shiny\u00a0\u00a0\nSatin I approve I really really like that one I'm\u00a0\ngonna just apply a little bit of highlighter and\u00a0\u00a0\nsome eye primer and then we can get in with the\u00a0\neyeshadow did I just like talk about this entire\u00a0\u00a0\nuh thing and I'm just done now and we're at the\u00a0\neye shadow I don't know oh I use another brush\u00a0\u00a0\nwith this one this time because I felt like\u00a0\nthe brush that I used last time wasn't the\u00a0\u00a0\nbest one this is highlighter by colourpop it's a\u00a0\nlittle bit hard pressed and it's definitely not\u00a0\u00a0\nat least not this color that is in Heart of Gold\u00a0\nlet's not drop it it's not like a super blinding\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlight honestly it's more like an almost like\u00a0\na glowy blush topper because it is so peachy pink\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I thought it would like match with this look\u00a0\nand it goes really well with the with the blush\num this um this tastes like lipstick\u00a0\ntoo you know the lipstick taste\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know if I love that okay let me go in\u00a0\nwith some of the eyeshadows actually let me\nman of a board let me put on some swatches\u00a0\nof these and you can see what it looks like\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is the your forever love I'm pretty sure\u00a0\nthat this is in the collaboration with helping\u00a0\u00a0\ndoggies in need so if you are interested in that\u00a0\nas well I think that some of the proceeds from\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one is being donated to charity I will say\u00a0\nI don't have the best eyesight listen a [\u00a0__\u00a0]\u00a0\u00a0\nis 39 and this is white printed on mint and I am\u00a0\nhaving a very very very hard time reading this\u00a0\u00a0\nreally really hard time but it is yeah I'll link\u00a0\nit down below what do I want to start with I think\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna start with I want to do one of the\u00a0\nholographic shadows and I'm thinking I might\u00a0\u00a0\ndo the pink one just because I kind of want\u00a0\nto do I feel like I want to do something pink\u00a0\u00a0\ntoday so I might start with the chasing tail\u00a0\njust because I want this to be like a fully\u00a0\u00a0\nlike pinky look so I think I'm gonna put a little\u00a0\nbit of that out here what do you think about this\u00a0\u00a0\nwhole D influencing Trend who do you think has\u00a0\nbeen doing it the best and actually has been like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe influencing and like letting people know\u00a0\nto save their money not like buy this instead\u00a0\u00a0\nnot like a just hating on products not just like\u00a0\nreviewing a product honestly that they just don't\u00a0\u00a0\nlike but actually like truly the influencing you\u00a0\nto be like I don't need another blush or I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nneed another highlighter it doesn't matter if\u00a0\nit's good or not that's not the whole point of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe influencing the influencing is not really or\u00a0\nlike an anti-haul it's not really about whether\u00a0\u00a0\nor not the product is good it's more about the\u00a0\ndoesn't matter if it's good or not do you need it\u00a0\u00a0\nor do you like have it and I mean I will be super\u00a0\nhappy if this whole the influencing Trend means\u00a0\u00a0\nthat we get to see more varied reviews on Tick\u00a0\nTock of just people not just wowing and gushing\u00a0\u00a0\nand being so excited over any kind of makeup that\u00a0\nfalls into their lap but actually like looking at\u00a0\u00a0\nit critically and being like did we need this\u00a0\nor do I own this because I feel like Tick Tock\u00a0\u00a0\nis just stuck in this hamster wheel of 2016 where\u00a0\nall makeup releases are the best makeup release\u00a0\u00a0\nsince sliced bread and people are just overly\u00a0\nexcited about things being released even though\u00a0\u00a0\nthey have been equally excited about the same kind\u00a0\nof product already three times this week like how\u00a0\u00a0\nmany times a week can a highlighter change your\u00a0\nlife I would argue not even once so I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\ngo in with this shade in the middle now it is\u00a0\ncalled oh my this wine text on mint Waggy tail oh\u00a0\u00a0\nI miss my little My Little Buddies I\u00a0\nwonder where they are is there is there\u00a0\u00a0\nhello I don't think they're here right now I was\u00a0\nup with them just before this and they're just\u00a0\u00a0\ncutest in the world absolutely adore them if you\u00a0\ndidn't know I have two dogs and a cat we have one\u00a0\u00a0\nboxer that we brought here from Sweden his name\u00a0\nis Tesla and then we have a rescue dog that We\u00a0\u00a0\nrescued here in the neighborhood she was abandoned\u00a0\nand she wasn't shipped and nobody claimed her and\u00a0\u00a0\nshe was not very well taken care of it was not\u00a0\nvery well taken care of so we decided to take\u00a0\u00a0\nher in because the shelters were full so we just\u00a0\nhad her here until we like to decide what we were\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna do with her and because the shelters were\u00a0\nfull but she just so quickly got along with other\u00a0\u00a0\npets so well and I mean we have a cat as well that\u00a0\nwe also brought here from Sweden her name is semla\u00a0\u00a0\nand she loves Kaiser she loves Kaiser like\u00a0\nrescue dog so yeah she stays here now so we\u00a0\u00a0\nwere just taking her in the beginning because\u00a0\nthe shelters were full but then we were like no\u00a0\u00a0\nshe likes it here and we love her so I'm so happy\u00a0\nthat she stays here okay so the one that I want to\u00a0\u00a0\nuse is this one it is called you are my BFF and\u00a0\nit I'll show you a Swatch I'll show you a Swatch\u00a0\u00a0\nof how this one looks and it is like a almost\u00a0\nlike a a fiery Coral to a gold and it has that\u00a0\u00a0\ngray holographic base so it has like holographic\u00a0\nparticles in it as well I love that I'm just going\u00a0\u00a0\nin and I don't really have a plan I'll I'll be\u00a0\nprepared with a brush so let us see if we can just\u00a0\u00a0\nah oh my God this is gonna be fine it's gonna\u00a0\nbe fun to be fine it's gonna be fine I feel\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I'm that Meme you know the dog that's\u00a0\nlike sitting in the burning room it's fine\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I think this is fine so I'm just gonna\u00a0\nblend this out and just like have a thin layer\nthat actually looks super cute let me see at the\u00a0\nend when we're done with this look if I can like\u00a0\u00a0\nlower the light a little bit and we can see if we\u00a0\ncan catch some of the effect on the lid because I\u00a0\u00a0\nsee the effect here in real life but I know in\u00a0\nlike the um the light that comes straight ahead\u00a0\u00a0\nit's really hard sometimes to see it but I will I\u00a0\nwill make it my mission to get this to like show\u00a0\u00a0\nup at the end of the video I will say I used\u00a0\na little bit of this peach in my inner corners\u00a0\u00a0\nthat was very nice I didn't even spray it or\u00a0\nanything it looks pretty cool to be honest I\u00a0\u00a0\nbig fan I really like it uh we're gonna use\u00a0\nthis new mascara it is from Maybelline this\u00a0\u00a0\nis The falsies Surreal extensions mascara\u00a0\nthis is a new one it looks like this\nlet's see how this one is\u00a0\u00a0\nhmm not very voluminizing but I mean it\u00a0\ndoesn't have to be I like an elongating mascara\u00a0\u00a0\nI did get a little up here which is not ideal\u00a0\nso it is a little bit more on the watery side\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm not it is elongating but I'm\u00a0\nnot overly impressed with this\u00a0\u00a0\nbrush I feel like it's not like grabbing\u00a0\non to the lashes enough to really lift it\nI'll I'll try this a bit more but just first\u00a0\nimpression I don't like it more than the Lash\u00a0\u00a0\nSensational this is The falsi Surreal I don't feel\u00a0\nlike this is giving me a falsies effect at all but\u00a0\u00a0\nwe'll see okay so I did this\u00a0\na little bit darker so that\u00a0\u00a0\nwe can see the eye color and let me see if I can\nis this gonna\nI don't know do you do we see anything do you\u00a0\nsee anything maybe here a little bit right\nam I Am I Dreaming or amuse are you seeing stuff\nyou're probably like [\u00a0__\u00a0] you can't see anything\u00a0\nokay I tried can I get a cookie for trying also I\u00a0\u00a0\nwas having some sound issues in the beginning of\u00a0\nthis video I hope I was able to fix it in editing\u00a0\u00a0\nfor some reason my microphone was on the wrong\u00a0\nsetting maybe I'm haunted maybe this house is\u00a0\u00a0\nhaunted but it should be on the right settings now\u00a0\nso if you see any discrepancies between the first\u00a0\u00a0\npart of the video and this outro it's because of\u00a0\nthe settings I'm I'm gonna do the best I can to\u00a0\u00a0\nfix that in editing but if you heard something\u00a0\nwrong I'm sorry technical issues but this is the\u00a0\u00a0\nfinal look coming out of the video I will say this\u00a0\nFoundation is still not my favorite it just feels\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it's going to melt off my face at any second\u00a0\npart of me is super super excited that Tick Tock\u00a0\u00a0\nis finally coming into their era of being like we\u00a0\ndon't need to love everything we can be a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit more nuanced like we don't need to either\u00a0\nlove it or hate it either it's okay to just feel\u00a0\u00a0\nindifferent about it sometimes and just be like\u00a0\nthere's nothing wrong with this but you definitely\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't need it I'm really happy to see the tech\u00a0\ntalk is coming into that era the other part of me\u00a0\u00a0\nis feeling like I'm a grumpy old lady being like\u00a0\nwe invented this first even though I was not part\u00a0\u00a0\nof inventing this in any way shape or form just\u00a0\nI understand that a new time calls for a new term\u00a0\u00a0\nbut the influencing is just anti-hauling or quite\u00a0\nhonestly just being honest about a product not\u00a0\u00a0\nalways talking about products you love but also\u00a0\nbeing a little bit more new months than talking\u00a0\u00a0\nabout the products you don't love I will say\u00a0\nthough what I'm still missing in nine times out of\u00a0\u00a0\nten on the platform is that people are not really\u00a0\nsaying why they love something or why they hate\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething it's just that it's super amazing but\u00a0\nthey never let you know more about like textures\u00a0\u00a0\nand formulas and their skin type and what they\u00a0\nprefer is like there are so many more layers to\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts and why they might work out for you and\u00a0\nwhy they might not work out for somebody else and\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't want to be like a grumpy old lady that's\u00a0\njust like me I don't like this new stuff because\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't want to be that person okay I'm a cool\u00a0\nadult okay I'll be a cool Mom I'm a cool dog mom\u00a0\u00a0\nis this just me telling myself this but all in\u00a0\nall I just wish that we would call it what it is\u00a0\u00a0\nand that is that we're giving a negative review\u00a0\nwe're just letting people know that we actually\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't love everything that we're trying and it\u00a0\nis totally a fine to review something and not\u00a0\u00a0\nlove it without just coming up with a new term\u00a0\nbecause anti-hauling at its very core is not\u00a0\u00a0\nbuying it not trying it it is telling you that you\u00a0\ndon't need it without even trying it or buying it\u00a0\u00a0\nand that's not what the influencing\u00a0\nis most of the time people seem to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe the influencing stuff that they've\u00a0\nactually tried and then it's just a review\u00a0\u00a0\nwe already have a word for that I hope\u00a0\nyou liked the video please don't forget\u00a0\u00a0\nto subscribe if everything goes to plan I'm\u00a0\ngonna have a very very exciting video come\u00a0\u00a0\nin a couple of days and I hope you're having\u00a0\nan amazing day and I will see you soon bye",

Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

        "transcript_text": "hey guys so for today's video I created this\u00a0\nall matte eyeshadow look with the new Huda\u00a0\u00a0\nBeauty matte cool obsessions eyeshadow palette\u00a0\nthis was my very first time using it today and I\u00a0\u00a0\nreally like the color of the look that I came up\u00a0\nwith it kind of matches my shirt perfectly so if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou want to see my thoughts on this palette and\u00a0\nhow I created this eyeshadow look go and keep on\u00a0\u00a0\nwatching here is a little close-up of the palette\u00a0\nuntouched it is so beautiful I love these cool\u00a0\u00a0\ntone Shades and I believe that these two shades\u00a0\nright here are some sort of like cream formula\u00a0\u00a0\nso I actually might Swatch those really quick see\u00a0\nwhat those look like there oh interesting okay I\u00a0\u00a0\nmight try out one of those today and I will be\u00a0\nusing some brushes for my new Sigma favorites\u00a0\u00a0\nbrush set I will leave all the information down\u00a0\nbelow about this in case you're interested okay\u00a0\u00a0\nthe E28 brush for my set is perfect for these\u00a0\ncream Shadows so I'm going to take this one on\u00a0\u00a0\nmy brush and I did already pry my eyes I use the\u00a0\nrare Beauty eyeshadow primer and I set that with\u00a0\u00a0\na translucent powder so we'll see how these\u00a0\ncreams apply on top of that kind of set base\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I'm going to take that cream shadow and just\u00a0\nlightly pack that all over my lid this is nice\nand I'm using a really light hand too\nnot mad about that cream formula I'm gonna\u00a0\nclean off this brush on my Sigma switch just\u00a0\u00a0\nto get all the cream pigment off of it\u00a0\nand then I'm going to try to soften the\u00a0\u00a0\nedges with no product on my brush so just\u00a0\nkind of blending that out slightly [Music]\n[Music]\u00a0\u00a0\nI kind of want to try to layer\u00a0\nanother Shadow on top of that\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm going to pick up this shade\u00a0\nbecause I feel like that goes nicely\u00a0\u00a0\nwith this one so this shade on my E28\u00a0\nand again just packing that on my lid\n[Music]\noh pigment is beautiful and I also have\u00a0\nzero Fallout right now which is perfect\nI'm going to add a little more of that\u00a0\npowder shadow on the lower part of my lid\u00a0\u00a0\nso like really close to my lash line so it's\u00a0\nkind of Darker here and then diffuses up all\u00a0\u00a0\nright now I want to soften these edges\u00a0\na bit so I'm going to take this middle\u00a0\u00a0\nshade on my Sigma e27 and just start to\u00a0\nsoften around that purpley shade foreign\n[Music]\u00a0\u00a0\nthese Shadows are blending out so beautifully\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it's almost kind of effortless now\u00a0\nI'm going to take more of that shade\u00a0\u00a0\nI put on my lid with my e42 I'm going\u00a0\nto blend that along my lower lash line\nand then going back to that Center shade and just\u00a0\nkind of blending around that to soften it out\nforeign\nand I'm going to take that deepest shade and\u00a0\nI'm going to use that to deepen up the outer\u00a0\u00a0\npart of my lid just the very outer corner and\u00a0\nthis brush just fits perfectly in this spot on\u00a0\u00a0\nmy eye I'm packing on the color but also\u00a0\nblending it out and then I also want that\u00a0\u00a0\nDarkness on the outer part of my lower lash\u00a0\nline so it's kind of connected right out here\nforeign\nhere are what the eyes are looking like so far\u00a0\nsuper duper matte but honestly it matches my\u00a0\u00a0\nshirt perfectly I kind of love that now I\u00a0\nneed to add a highlighter to add a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit of shine to this eye look so I'm going\u00a0\nto take my rare Beauty highlighter and then\u00a0\u00a0\nlighten on my Sigma e33 and I'm just going\u00a0\nto Pat that in my inner corner right here\u00a0\u00a0\nand then taking whatever is left on\u00a0\nmy brush just right under my brow\nall right I'm gonna go pop on some mascara and\u00a0\nlashes and then I'll show you the final look\u00a0\u00a0\nall right my mascara and lashes are on and I did\u00a0\npop a little bit of a nude liner in my waterline\u00a0\u00a0\njust a tiny bit right there just to add like\u00a0\na little bit more brightness to the look since\u00a0\u00a0\nthe look is pretty kind of dark and matte and\u00a0\nthen for my lashes today I'm wearing one of my\u00a0\u00a0\nfavorite styles from the bright lashes it is the\u00a0\nstyle and daydream all right and here's what the\u00a0\u00a0\nfull face looks like I did not plan on matching\u00a0\nmy shirt today but like this shadow looks perfect\u00a0\u00a0\nwith this shirt and for my lips I'm wearing the\u00a0\nHuda beauty cream lipstick in the shade Angel\u00a0\u00a0\nso when I bought this palette I was looking at\u00a0\nher lipsticks because you guys know I loved her\u00a0\u00a0\nlipstick and Buttercup but mine ended up breaking\u00a0\nso I had to throw it away and I really wanted\u00a0\u00a0\nto try another one so I bought the shade Angel\u00a0\nit's a very pretty just pink color let me just\u00a0\u00a0\ndo a little Swatch here I really do like her cream\u00a0\nformula so I wanted something just like a straight\u00a0\u00a0\npink and I think it's really pretty before I put\u00a0\non my lipsticks I've actually been kind of like\u00a0\u00a0\nblinking out my lips with my foundation brush so\u00a0\nI'll Pat over my lips with my foundation brush and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen pop up my lipstick because my lips are so\u00a0\nnice naturally pigmented that I really want the\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor of the lipstick to shine through I also kind\u00a0\nof feel like I don't have much to say about this\u00a0\u00a0\npalette like I liked it am I like obsessed with\u00a0\nit not really but but I definitely wanted to try\u00a0\u00a0\nit because I always love her little obsessions\u00a0\npalette like when she came out with the Smoky\u00a0\u00a0\nobsessions I used that one so much so this is\u00a0\ndifferent than the other palettes I have in my\u00a0\u00a0\ncollection like I don't own a little cute small\u00a0\ncool tone palette am I gonna get a lot of use\u00a0\u00a0\nout of this I don't really know but but if you're\u00a0\nsomeone who loves matte eyeshadows I know a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nof my older subscribers just love my shadows and\u00a0\ndon't want to wear any kind of Shimmer or glitter\u00a0\u00a0\nyou would really like this palette again there\u00a0\nis a warm tone version of this but I just didn't\u00a0\u00a0\npick it up because I have a million warm toned\u00a0\neyeshadows I don't have many cool tone palettes\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I gotta say now that I've been sitting here\u00a0\nfor a couple minutes I feel like it is creasing\u00a0\u00a0\nin my crease let me show you this do you see\u00a0\nthat just like tiny bit of creasing in my crease\u00a0\u00a0\nthat definitely could be from the cream eyeshadow\u00a0\nespecially because I placed it on top of a set\u00a0\u00a0\nbase that I set with the powder so I might\u00a0\nhave to play around with this a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nmore okay it's currently 2 30. I think I put on\u00a0\nmy makeup at like one o'clock maybe 12 30 and my\u00a0\u00a0\neyelids are creasing and this just does not look\u00a0\ngood so I think I'm gonna play around with it a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle bit and update you guys on how to work the\u00a0\npalette best but clearly the way that I did today\u00a0\u00a0\nis not working I like never have my eyeshadow\u00a0\ncreasing so this is different for me but just\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to let you guys know that to wrap up this\u00a0\nvideo anyways let me know if you're gonna pick\u00a0\u00a0\nup any of these two little matte palettes I would\u00a0\nlove to know your thoughts on it and I hope you\u00a0\u00a0\nguys enjoyed this video thank you so much for\u00a0\nwatching and don't forget to like And subscribe",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day.

Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

Diese Dinger sind ja extra so konzipiert, dass sie die Haut reizen und damit die Lippen aufplustern. Ich glaube teilweise ist da auch so Chili, Pfefferminz und sowas drin. Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

comes out even if it is not done for my skin type I don't know\nwhy I have to buy it so there were some misses with the watertone which is not at all\nmade for dry skin I remind you I have dry skin but here I am testing them\ngave me great pleasure by releasing a little novelty which is a powder foundation so\non paper it's not made for me they say it's for normal combination and\noily skin but for all that I want test knowing that I have used the infallible a lot knowing\nthat I have it in three shades of different so here from L'Or\u00e9al I'm not going to get there this\nmorning and I also have the Urban Decay which I like a lot and suddenly I say to myself that why not\nwill have to prepare the skin well a space to apply this foundation powder foundation we are going to take a look at\nthe characteristics together but first I am going to open it so it is the HD skin matte\nVelvet so there is an HD skin foundation that exists at make-up For Ever which is reformulated\nI think a short time ago it's a foundation that I used quite a bit I had bought\nminis twice at Sephora because there had been reductions when I had a\nSephora and well listen it was going pretty good in the summer anyway it was pretty good so\nit's a foundation that I already know this is how the packaging looks so it opens\nof course it opens open we have a mirror so we'll see if it's really useful we\nhave the foundation here and we have a little sponge that we're going to use because that we will see in\ntheir instructions they say to use it we can even use it on two different sides\ndepending on the rendering we want to have so concerning the shade I took the y 18 so\nit's a foundation that costs 39 euros you have to know it's not the same price as L'Or\u00e9al which\nmust be 16 or 17 euros you can find them at that price, however it's not a brand\nexcluded from Sephora and suddenly you have the minus 25%, you usually don't necessarily know when\nyou're gold or nothing at all but when there's minus 25% in Valloire from 80 or I do\nn't know what stupidity happens on make-up For Ever me it suits me because it's a bit my\nfavorite brand I buy a lot on vinted too so this product has just been released so we\nwill hardly find it what do we say it blurs the pores it mattifies comfortable and\nit is ultra natural 24 hour wear yes I made notes lasted 24 hours apparently\nthree po ago different shades inside but they don't really say what so good it's\nwaterproof of course as I told you rather for normal combination skin it's thanks\n24 hour hold medium coverage to raise so we'll see because on my face there is rosacea\nthere are even small pimples I don't know what happened I had to exfoliate it\ndidn't please isolate with the sponges from the center of the face to the outside with the soft side\nso normally on the inside I have to have a soft side and a slightly less soft side\nand then we can go back to have a more natural side with the other side or\nelse we use a classic powder brush to be able to apply the foundation\nis a powder that we can also probably apply according to what\nthey say on a liquid foundation so no more finishing powder so have all that\nbefore starting the tests we will of course prepare her skin you know that at make-up For\nEver we have pl Several bases so I often use this one it's my favorite it's the one\nthat's moisturizing so there it will be a booster at first I wanted to use this one but it's ok\ncome I use another one there are others one of the bases at make-up For Ever we have the green one\nI think there is a video with the glass somewhere necessarily which hides the redness the green\nyou have here a more orange one and here it's the menizer shape so wear reducer and as\nI was telling you so this foundation I'm going all over the place this morning it's the HD skin\nthat's the liquid version that I just got drop this morning I decided to use this one\nso it's a base but with an SPF so there are a lot of people who criticized make-up\nFor Ever for making a product without SPF I see why we tell them would criticize that it's not a\ncare product it's a make-up product if you want an SPF you put your SPF cream or\nyou put here it's an SPF cream and it is moisturizing so 50 pa plus plus tray of daily makeup\nso here we go we're going to put this on my complexion before using the base I'm going to\nprepare my eyes you know I use this little product it from make-up For Ever which costs\na lot I buy it on vinted but at the same time I don't use it much so it's\nultra HD so we're on the same skin booster range and it's like a small serum with a\ndoll I just take a very small drop and I just put on my eye contour\nand I go up well on the sides that's where the dehydration is often marked so there I\n'm going to put some on my eyelids usually I never have eyes to make up there we are going to do\na little differently this morning so here it is and I forgot a step necessarily when you\nfilm it's not the same as usual before starting anything I put a mist\nso there it's the beauty white that I like it's a fixative but also priming on\ntop it won't change anything and once I put that on I'm going to seal\nthe hydration of my eye contour if you you don't have dry eye area\nno need to do this step if you are 15 years old 20 years old 25 years old and everything is fine next I'm going\nto take this little vegetable shark oil from Aroma-Zone but in reality you can\nuse all the oils you want or a cream or nothing and I'm going to come, it's the\nhydration there I'm actually preparing my outline of the eyes because he's really dehydrated\nand I don't hesitate to put a jar in the middle of both eyes I'm still dehydrated\nand it'll dry for a minute I take the base and I'm going to come\nand put some then it's It's really a sunscreen for the shot [Music]\nthere it is not a joke we are really on a sunscreen\nI put it everywhere and yes the sunscreen is white but it will fade away it's\ngone j I've been waiting for three to four minutes we're going to start by doing a side to see\nhow it's already covering the side I'm going to take the side where there is the most\nrosacea I take the little sponge so I'm going to find out is a crash test I had reached\nso indeed we have a very soft side here and a side \u00e9 a little more not plasticized we will say\nwe have to stretch the material and with the other we will tap here is what is noted to\nreach it I don't know if I meant how much we reached we have 38 shades of agreement\nwith 4 different undertones I believe you have a search engine in fact Finder tind of\nfiner which tells you exactly which one to buy so I took the y-18 it's make-up For\nEver who told me to do it so let's go I take some product it's a powder I think that\nand well already first impression it's dark\nat the level of the ports well I don't really agree I see I see my pores it doesn't blurred\nlike the classic make-up powders for ever it still marks the dehydration a bit so\nthere blah blah because it covers well yes clearly I think it covers that above no problem\nthe application with the sponge there I validate no I think it's too much I'm going\nto try on the other side so the other side of the sponge or you have to stretch and then s if I totally prefer\nthis side even if it is much less covering but after I can retype a little\npossibly much more natural the other side of the sponge I'm going to take a classic brush\nand I often apply the applications I do them like that I wanted to test their way of doing things\nbut here we are, therefore, we don't have the same result at all and it's this result that I like here\nit's horrible but horrible it marks everything it's there is a layer of material that is ugly and\nthere I don't know if you will see the difference clearly we are on a natural blurred side\nso there you have the application with a trowel and\nthere the more natural application for me there is no photo what\nso I don't know if we will see the camera I will remove everything yes I will lose a quarter of an hour\n20 minutes and I come back with a natural application back with clean hydrated skin\nI redid my whole routine so now the cream is finishing penetrating so we're going to\ndo it again less stressed as I would have done normally with my others foundation\nshould know that the other fontains I don't apply them like that but I wanted to test it already\nit's important and that way you have a result on then dry skin but still a bit\nmature skin also change the bass I saw that with the Solar Primer indeed that works so\nI'm going to use with my usual primer to see moisturizing so my skin is full of tea\ncome on let's go it's going to do it because so I pick up with the brush\nand so I start on the side where there is good pink cut\nhere we see powder but as soon as you put too much on me I'm sorry it marks the pores\nme I think it didn't mark\nand suddenly it doesn't hide them either whereas the reboot foundation hides my pores\nbut it is suitable for dry skin ok it's not a complete success after starting over\nit's not always wonderful there I have effects of hands then on the cheeks\nwhich are a little more normal let's say there it is really silky pretty on the other hand there it marks\nit is not a success I'm taking my makeup palette forever where I have everything to do to\nfinish my complexion and then to do my eyes I'm going to take a little bronzer\nah [ __ ] that's it I think that's it that's it rotten day\nI cleaned the palette just now so I don't understand the delirium\nchange brushes the thing is done no but what is this video seriously\nI'm going to take my Too Faced my milk chocolate that I'm trying to finish\nthe thing that's not left in me\nif you're still there but disaster for me in the comments\nmy skin is all sticky can I take the blue one\nplease because it's possible\nyes but\nand then let's be crazy I'm going to take the highlighter\nso at eye level I'm going to take this color to make my hollow which is a bit\nshe's good\nI put it on the whole eyelid on my finger I'm going to take this color I tell you won't give the\nnames because I would have to go look I put it in the center of my eyelid of the pretty\ne t I make my connections it's without the same color as in the hollow under my\nRatier with the same brush I'm going to take the black and I concentrate in my outer corner\nand the same below\nok I added the liner from Martin Cosmetics and on my seats I put the peak mister big\nhe's back and he's back I'm telling you right away I'm happy with mister\nbig we're going to do the lips and then we'll talk again some time after I I put a little oil I remove\nI have a liquid lipstick from make-up For Ever but two other stick lipsticks\nare on sale in fact I bought them swatched I don't use them go to my vintage it's\ngoing right now it's going it's going I've done a lot of sorting me there I have shade 105\nit's a bit cold these are colors that I used a lot I stopped using say\nme if you like it ok I want to test something there you have a final make-up ok on camera\nI think it must be rather pretty I shine that and even really I find I shine enormously\nso I don't know what to tell you so we're going to take the Make\nUp For Ever powder I'm going to take my compact I'm taking my complexion brush and I'm going to powder it because\nit's not going so it might go off a little good here I go stop the carnage here because\nit's carnage the cheeks it's not just the fact that the skin is dry and\ndehydrated there's above all the fact that it's mature it marks a lot so\nit's a disaster everywhere there actually where I have small fine lines there\nit's the catalyst ok I'm not going to put anything on my eyebrows no need to\nuse a product for nothing review of this foundation so we tried finally I tried with the\nlittle powder puff there on both sides\nI don't know if I'll have the patience there it went really badly I don't remember ever having had\na problem like that with that so there I admit that I don't understand I\ngoing to try it again I don't know when but clearly everything is marked there we can\nsay it but as Fo dream is right it's not made for dry skin here I think\nthat will be the conclusion it's pretty indeed everywhere here where we have normal skin so there it's\nall smoothed and besides it's strangely dry it's dry there I have material effects all\nover the pores however I don't agree it doesn't camouflage the doors so\nhonestly except if you have oily skin I think even normal skin\nI'm not sure if you have oily and dehydrated skin be careful of such dehydrated skin\nI'm not convinced the eyes are pretty but the fact of not preparing my eyes in the\nsame way and not being able to clean well I could get used to it is a somewhat\ncatastrophic morning I hope you like the lipstick at least it doesn't make a complexion\na little cadaverous but well here it is for this test of Forever makeup chicken foundation this is\nthe second time that I have I have flops on complexion products but they are not suitable\nfor my skin type so that's me who am I can't help it that is to say that\nI have to test at Make Up Forever fortunately that I am not that for everything otherwise\nit would be a disaster I have not tested the taste of Apple with all the reviews that\ngot it we understood that it was not for me so who had beauty if you're wondering\nhere I think we'll stop there for this week don't hesitate to\ntell me how you go in the comments if you're still there don't hesitate to give me\na thumbs up I send you lots of kisses the nude team thoroughly or in disaster for this morning hello",

Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

It's\u00a0\nwaterproof, fade proof for up to 12 hours and\u00a0\u00a0\nhas an unnecessarily long name (lol) and today\u00a0\nwe're putting it to the test. First let's color\u00a0\u00a0\nmatch this and see how it oxidizes down. Then\u00a0\nlet's see how this blends out and then finally\u00a0\u00a0\nwe're going to take this on the road and\u00a0\nsee how this wears! Let's start by giving\u00a0\u00a0\nthis a good shake this is it right here. It's\u00a0\ngot a beautiful glass component plastic lid\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful pump now the directions say to give this\u00a0\ntwo pumps when applying it so we're gonna do that\u00a0\u00a0\nwe're gonna see how two pumps because that is a\u00a0\ntiny pump like given my nail my nails are quite\u00a0\u00a0\nshort today but that is a tiny pump so I'm gonna\u00a0\ndo two pumps that's it that's all you get that is\u00a0\u00a0\na very small amount of foundation to cover your\u00a0\nwhole face but that is the recommended amount\u00a0\u00a0\nshe does recommend that you go in and use a brush\u00a0\nfor this to apply it apply it and Pat it out just\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of you know giving it a good sweep across\u00a0\nthe face only where you need it so I'm like is\u00a0\u00a0\nthis super full coverage why do you only have\u00a0\nto apply it where you need it and not all over\u00a0\u00a0\nyour face that's something I was like a little\u00a0\nbit curious about so we're going to go in with\u00a0\u00a0\na brush right now something a little bit dense\u00a0\nbut fluffy to blend this out I'm going to be\u00a0\u00a0\nusing this CC skin perfecting brush right here\u00a0\nthis is a number 702 from IT Cosmetics I'm just\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to tap into that Foundation I've got a good\u00a0\namount on my brush so she does say you can can go\u00a0\u00a0\nin with her primer which I have in front of me\u00a0\nbut she also says to go in with a clean face for\u00a0\u00a0\nthe best results and I'm thinking okay that's a\u00a0\nlittle bit contradictory so I'm gonna actually\u00a0\u00a0\napply this today with a completely clean face\u00a0\nbut you can go in and use any primer you want\u00a0\u00a0\nunder this Foundation let's talk about my problem\u00a0\nareas right now I've got a little bit of acne here\u00a0\u00a0\nspot here I've got my hyperpigmentation spot here\u00a0\nwhich you guys all know about because I complain\u00a0\u00a0\nabout it all the time but I've got a little bit\u00a0\nof redness right here and here this is kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nlike dark circles did not sleep great last night\u00a0\nso I've got a little bit of Darkness there okay so\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm going to be starting with this side of my face\u00a0\nbecause I want to see what the difference will be\u00a0\u00a0\nlike so I'm just going to start by doing small\u00a0\ncircular motions here on my cheek and my nose\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm going directly under the eye there's\u00a0\nno smell to this whatsoever so I really\u00a0\u00a0\nappreciate that blends out really nice super\u00a0\nsilky it covered that redness right there where\u00a0\u00a0\nI have that acne spot beautifully so let's go\u00a0\nin where I have the hyperpigmentation spot okay\nI would have liked to have seen a little bit\u00a0\nmore redness disappear right there but I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nhappy with it and I'm just taking what's left on\u00a0\nmy brush we're not dipping back into the palette\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'm just doing my forehead\u00a0\nblending it into my hairline\u00a0\u00a0\nand this is a beautiful color match when I picked\u00a0\nthis up at Sephora I actually ordered two of these\u00a0\u00a0\nI ordered one online it was a lot darker so I went\u00a0\ninto Sephora and I picked this up color matched it\u00a0\u00a0\nand I was like okay this is it in their little\u00a0\nCarousel display for this Foundation which is a\u00a0\u00a0\nbrand new display they didn't have this shade\u00a0\nshe had to go in the back which I thought was\u00a0\u00a0\nweird why wouldn't they have all the shades on\u00a0\ndisplay kind of a little weird but if you guys are\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing into Sephora to purchase this I recommend it\u00a0\nbecause according to the online website where they\u00a0\u00a0\nhave all the shades listed they are a lot darker\u00a0\nin person than they are on the website so this\u00a0\u00a0\nhas been on for a hot minute I have the product on\u00a0\nthis side of my face and nothing on this side this\u00a0\u00a0\nhonestly didn't really oxidize down terribly much\u00a0\nit is just the perfect shade there are 30 Shades\u00a0\u00a0\nin the collection honestly this is beautiful the\u00a0\ntexture like it did dry down but it is still very\u00a0\u00a0\na emollient and a little hydrating a little dewy\u00a0\nit's not totally dry dry like it moves a little\u00a0\u00a0\non me like it's it's a soft feeling it's not like\u00a0\na dried down feeling but it is a very hydrating\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct like it looks hydrating it looks really\u00a0\nnice compared to this side where I've got nothing\u00a0\u00a0\non my skin I like it so I am going to just tap\u00a0\ninto what is left on my palette she does say you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan go in and apply this on the back of your hand\u00a0\nwarm it up and then apply it to the face but I\u00a0\u00a0\njust decided to use my palette because I always\u00a0\nuse my palette I'm just going to blend this out\u00a0\u00a0\ninteresting so I have been talking to you guys for\u00a0\na hot minute and the product that was left on the\u00a0\u00a0\npalette I feel like it's a little bit drier now\u00a0\nand a little bit harder to blend out so I do work\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit fast when you are applying this maybe\u00a0\nthis has something to do with her new formula I\u00a0\u00a0\njust reviewed her brand new tinted bronzer and\u00a0\nhonestly you had like minutes like seconds to\u00a0\u00a0\nblend out that product and I feel like this one\u00a0\nis kind of the same it's you know it's giving me\u00a0\u00a0\na beautiful blend but it is just a little bit\u00a0\nmore of a work with you have to blend it in\u00a0\u00a0\nreally fast like that but the coverage\u00a0\nis beautiful it is a very light to\u00a0\u00a0\nnatural but medium coverage it did cover this red\u00a0\nright here which I really liked and definitely the\u00a0\u00a0\nred that I had right here and the dark circles\u00a0\nunder my eyes considering I have a no you know\u00a0\u00a0\nprimer no concealer I'm impressed now the texture\u00a0\nthe consistency of this if you guys have seen or\u00a0\u00a0\ntried the Lady Gaga house Labs Foundation which I\u00a0\nthink is beautiful and I believe that there is 51\u00a0\u00a0\nShades in that collection it is stunning gorgeous\u00a0\nFoundation love that one this is very similar in\u00a0\u00a0\ntexture to that but I feel like this one's even\u00a0\nmore hydrating than that one is this is also\u00a0\u00a0\nvery similar to the Chanel revitalizing Foundation\u00a0\nthat was launched about a year ago again beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it's just a beautiful coverage beautiful\u00a0\nFoundation feels exactly like that and very\u00a0\u00a0\nsimilar ingredients in that one as well that\u00a0\none is I believe 75 Canadian and I think that\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's 30 Shades in the collection now that I\u00a0\nhave that Blended in and I'm surprised two pumps\u00a0\u00a0\nis all that it took for me to blend out my entire\u00a0\nface compared to other foundations especially ones\u00a0\u00a0\nlike the brand new makeup by Mario his foundation\u00a0\nis gorgeous it's definitely more full coverage\u00a0\u00a0\nthan this but you have to go in with quite a\u00a0\nbit more he does recommend two pumps but you\u00a0\u00a0\nreally have to work that to blend it out this is\u00a0\nstunning like the coverage on this is beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nit Blends directly into my hairline you don't\u00a0\nhave that mask of demarcation the color matches\u00a0\u00a0\nphenomenal and it really kind of took away the\u00a0\nredness especially in my hyperpigmentation area\u00a0\u00a0\nright there and right here where I've got that\u00a0\nlittle acne spot and under my eye where I kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof have that blue vein that I always correct with\u00a0\nconcealer I have on no concealer whatsoever I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nhappy with this I could leave my house like this\u00a0\nwith just this on and be really really impressed\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna finish my face and I'll check back\u00a0\nin with you guys in about six hours loving the\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct except I'm getting lifting right here from\u00a0\nwearing my glasses it's a very dewy Foundation but\u00a0\u00a0\neven though I powdered it I set my face it lifts\u00a0\nright off when you're wearing glasses that part\u00a0\u00a0\nI do not love whatsoever if you do wear glasses\u00a0\nI would not recommend this foundation for you if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou guys would like Foundation recommendations for\u00a0\nglasses wearing people let me know and I can do a\u00a0\u00a0\nwhole video on it I did my very favorite makeup\u00a0\nhack where I went in with two different setting\u00a0\u00a0\nsprays the Patrick Star until dawn and also\u00a0\nthe Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless filter\u00a0\u00a0\nsetting spray mix those together my makeup never\u00a0\nbudges it budged honestly that is a proven hack\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I love and seriously with this it just budged\u00a0\nand it came off I'm not impressed let's head back\u00a0\u00a0\nto the studio and we're going to talk about\u00a0\nwhat I liked about it and what I don't [Music]\nwe're back in the studio let's talk about what\u00a0\nI liked about this product I love that you only\u00a0\u00a0\nneed two tiny tiny pumps with this and it's 64.\u00a0\nlike the price range I think all that's great\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is great for 12 months and honestly it's\u00a0\ngoing to work for the entire 12 months given\u00a0\u00a0\nthat you just need such a tiny amount with\u00a0\nthis bottle love that about this it's dewy\u00a0\u00a0\nit's glowy you've got a really nice texture\u00a0\nto it you can go in with primer it's going to\u00a0\u00a0\nstick a little bit better but my problem with\u00a0\nthis the major problem with this is for those\u00a0\u00a0\nof you that wear glasses like I do this picked up\u00a0\nand it shifted right here and it moved but on the\u00a0\u00a0\nwebsite this claims 12 hours of fade proof\u00a0\nwear did we get 12 hours of fade proof wear\u00a0\u00a0\nno we did not so that is disappointing to me now\u00a0\nI can go in with a primer a different primer I am\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to test this out I will update you guys in\u00a0\nthe future but if you guys are going in with no\u00a0\u00a0\nprimer and a clean face like they recommend just\u00a0\nknow that it will lift up off the bridge of your\u00a0\u00a0\nnose if you're wearing sunglasses or eyeglasses\u00a0\nit's just it's gonna happen it happened to me\u00a0\u00a0\nit'll probably happen to you especially if you're\u00a0\nin a humid climate like Florida or somewhere like\u00a0\u00a0\nthat now can I recommend this to you guys I think\u00a0\nit's stunning I think it's really beautiful but\u00a0\u00a0\nat the same time I would recommend probably the\u00a0\nhouse Labs Foundation over this one and also the\u00a0\u00a0\nChanel if you're looking for something a little\u00a0\nbit more higher end go with the Chanel but the\u00a0\u00a0\nhouse Labs has more shades being as they have 51\u00a0\nShades and it's cheaper it's this formula is very\u00a0\u00a0\nvery similar like it's so comparable it's crazy\u00a0\nif you guys want me to battle it out let me know\u00a0\u00a0\nin the comments down below because if you loved\u00a0\nthe video don't forget to hit that like button\u00a0\u00a0\nit helps your girl out and if you guys haven't\u00a0\nseen it yet definitely check out the brand new\u00a0\u00a0\nLaura Mercier tinted bronzer right there all right\u00a0\nguys until next time live love and lip gloss bye",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

My lips are not as torn up as they have been from previous lip swatch videos thanks to my Silk Naturals Super Fruit Lip Mask. There are so many reds in this collection! My favorites include Rebel Red, Punk Pink, Champagne Dreams, Merlot, Dracula, Fangria, Green Apple, and Blue Bayou. Pink Champagne is also nice and reminds me a lot of UD Backtalk. I believe the Emily the Strange shades are new for 2023.

        "transcript_text": "- Welcome back, beautiful creatures.\nI'm so grateful to have you here.\nIf you're new here, my name's Cordelia,\nand I love talking about bright\nand colorful alternative makeup,\ngothic fashion, mental health, and more.\nAbout 95% of the videos on\nmy channel are beauty-related\nand I currently upload\nvideos on the weekends\nand as many during the\nweek as I possibly can.\nSo today's video is going to be\na Vampyre Cosmetics liquid\nlipsticks lip swatch video.\nNow, just so you are aware,\nI didn't use lip liner for all of these,\nso I did my lips rather hastily.\nSo any imperfections on\nthe outside of my lips\nare going to be my fault.\nSo please be kind. Don't\nbe a jerk about it.\nI wanted to get through\nswatching all of these for you,\neven though it kills my lips,\nbecause my lips are not meant to handle\nthat much lip swatching\nback to back to back.\nI think I did 14 or 16\ncolors, so they're dying.\nBut I'm excited to share these with you.\nJust so you know,\nVampyre Cosmetics has sent\nme all of these colors.\nSo these were all PR.\nI do have a code with Vampyre\nCosmetics, which is CORDELIA,\nand you can use that on their\nwebsite to save you money.\nYou can also find Vampyre\nCosmetics at hottopic.com.\nSo let's jump into those lip swatches.\nSo these are my natural\nlips with nothing on them.\nThey're very actually\nirritated at the moment,\nbut I don't have much lip color.\nI don't have a strong lip line.\nMy lips are just kind\nof like soft in there.\nIt's like a barely\nthere, mauve pink color.\nSo the first color we're gonna start with\nis from the Emily Release.\nThis is Rebel Red.\n(gentle upbeat music)\n(gentle upbeat music continues)\nSo this is Rebel Red.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nThis is also from the\nEmily Strange Collection.\nThe color is called Punk Pink.\n(gentle upbeat music)\n(gentle upbeat music continues)\nI love Punk Pink.\nThis color reminds me of one\nof my favorite OCC lip tars.\nI can't think of the name of it,\nbut it was like super bright.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nThe third Emily the Strange color I have\nis Precocious Purple.\n(gentle upbeat music)\n(gentle upbeat music continues)\nThe formula on this color is\nnot as nice as the other two,\nand I feel like you need two layers\nto get the purple to go on evenly.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nThe next color is Champagne Dreams.\nThis is a gorgeous gold,\nand I used it recently in a\ngold monochromatic makeup look.\nI'll put a link up here for\nyou to go check that look out.\n(gentle upbeat music)\n(gentle upbeat music continues)\nThis is Champaign Dreams.\nI love this color.\nI think it's awesome,\nespecially if you're\nlooking for a gold color.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nI used Lime Crime's Poison\nLip Pencil to outline my lips\njust to speed up the process.\nI'm going to use the color Undead Red.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nUndead Red, this is a very\nbright warm red, in my opinion.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nOur next red is Sinful Zin.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nSo Sinful Zin, in my opinion,\nis more of like a brick red.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nOur next red is Cabernet.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nSo Cabernet is like a deep\ncool burgundy red color to me.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nI love deep reds like this.\nOur next red is Red Wine Blend.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nSo here's Red Wine Blend.\nThis is another orange-based red.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nAll right, we are on our\nlast red, and this is Merlot.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nSo this is Merlot.\nThis is more of like a\npurple-based burgundy wine.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nNext, we have Dracula.\nThis is a pure black.\nI've worn this many times.\nIt is a great liquid lipstick.\nIt lasts all evening for\nme with minimal wear.\nSo I really, really love the black,\nwhich is what made me\nwanna do lip swatches\nof all the colors for you.\n(gentle upbeat music)\n(gentle upbeat music continues)\nHere we have Dracula.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nI just, I love it.\nIt's a great black.\nOur next color is Fangria\nand I think this is a purple.\nLooks like it's a bright\nvivid purple, so...\nOoh, yeah.\nSuper excited. It's a blue-based purple.\n(gentle upbeat music)\n(gentle upbeat music continues)\nOh, yeah, I love this\npurple much, much more\nthan the one from the Emily\nthe Strange Collection.\nThis is more of a blue-toned purple\nand the formula was a lot better.\nIt's much, much closer\nto the other colors.\nI feel like that one purple\nseems to be an anomaly\n'cause it doesn't have the same\nformula as everything else.\nSo this is Fangria.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nI just love purples,\nand the name Fangria, I\nthink, is absolutely adorable.\nMakes me think back to the\n\"True Blood\" TV series.\nOur next color is Blue Bayou,\nand I'm very excited for a blue,\nyou know I love brights.\n(gentle upbeat music)\n(gentle upbeat music continues)\nThis is Blue Bayou.\nI found this formula needed two layers\nmuch like that purple from\nthe Emily the Strange Trio.\nIt's not the same formula\nas the other colors.\nI feel like it's not as nice of a formula,\nbut the color is still pretty fantastic\nand I was able to get\nit even in two layers.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nOur next color is Green Apple.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nThis is Green Apple.\nI think it looks more\nlike a swamp witch green,\nand I am here for it.\nI think it's gorgeous.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nNow, it's time for the last lip color.\nI just outlined my lips\nwith my HAUS LABS Lip Pencil\nin the shade Carve,\nwhich is like a magenta.\nAnd our last color is Pink Champagne.\n(gentle upbeat music)\n(gentle upbeat music continues)\nAll right, so this is Pink Champagne.\nI think it's adorable.\n(gentle upbeat music)\nOkay, now you've had a chance\nto see the lip swatches,\nand I believe there were only\ntwo or maybe three shades\nthat gave me an issue,\nand I mentioned those\nduring the swatching.\nI know that there was the purple\nfrom the Emily the Strange Trio.\nThat purple, I needed two layers with,\nso it was slightly thinner formula,\nand I feel like the other color\nthat gave me a little bit\nof trouble was Blue Bayou.\nSo I think those were the two.\nNow, the Emily the Strange\nlipsticks are $22 each.\nAll of the rest of the liquid\nlipsticks are $19 each.\nAnd at the time I am recording this,\nthere's a 50% off sale\ngoing on on their website.\nSo you can get the lipsticks\nfor, I think, 9.98 or something like that.\nI feel like the swatches on\nthe site are fairly accurate,\nexcept for the color\nI'm wearing right here.\nThis is Pink Champagne on the website.\nPink Champagne looks like it's more like\nthe color of my hair,\nmore towards the magenta,\nbut it's definitely a softer pink.\nI would say this reminds me a little bit\nof Urban Decay's Backtalk,\nbut it has a little bit more\npigmentation and depth to it.\nIt's a great color.\nDracula is the matte black\nand that's one of my\nall-time favorite shades.\nIt is an excellent black.\nI've worn it for up to\n16 hours with no issues.\nI do have to touch it up\na little bit after I eat and I drink\nif there's excessive oil in my foods,\nbut it's not bad at all.\nIt's very comfortable to wear.\nFor a liquid lipstick formula,\nthis formula does not feel drying,\nand even though I just\nswatched, like, what was it?\n14 or 16 colors back to back,\nmy lips are not screaming the\nway they would in the past.\nSo I'm very happy with how my lips feel\ndespite having just tortured them.\nI really, really love the color Fangria.\nIf you were somebody who\nloves blue-toned purple,\nyou definitely need to\ncheck out that color.\nI think it's just stunning.\nThere are a lot of great reds,\nespecially if you like\nbrick or orange-based reds\nbecause I feel like there are\na lot of orange-based reds\nin the Red Collection.\nI absolutely love Champagne Dreams.\nIf you are somebody who's looking\nfor an unusual sort of gold\nmetallic color, that is it.\nAnd it is so easy and comfortable to wear.\nThey had a really cool Green Apple color,\nwhich makes me think more\nof like a swamp witch green.\nSo it was, like, I don't know,\nmore like sort of muted and sultry.\nI like it a lot.\nI absolutely loved Rebel Red.\nThe bright red from the Emily Collection,\nI love bright reds.\nThese lipsticks are 100%\ncruelty-free and 100% vegan.\nAnd if you don't know\nabout Vampyre Cosmetics,\nI have another video up\nhere that you can check out\nthat's on their Cthulhu Cocktails Palette,\nand you might like it.\nBut if you don't know much about them,\nI will say one of the\nthings I love about them\nis that they are a woman-owned brand,\nthey are a neurodivergent-owned\nbrand, et cetera.\nSo they check a lot of boxes for me.\nSo what do you think\nabout the Vampyre\nCosmetics liquid lipsticks?\nAre there any colors that you like?\nAre there any colors\nyou would like to see them come out with?\nI would absolutely love to\nsee them make multichromes\nin this liquid lipstick formula\nbecause it is so comfortable,\nand I feel like it was some...\nI feel like it's something\nthat would be very popular,\nbut maybe I'm in the minority\nbecause I love multichromes.\nWhat do you think?\nPlease let me know your\nthoughts in the comments below.\nThank you so much for watching.\nIf you enjoyed this video and\nyou wanna see more like it,\nplease give it a thumbs up, and share,\nand subscribe if you\nhaven't already subscribed.\nThank you so much for\nwatching, beautiful creatures.\nI love you and I'll see you next time.\nBye.\n(gentle upbeat music)",

Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

        "transcript_text": "- Hello beautiful creatures.\nWelcome back to my channel, Phyrra.\nIf you're new here, my\nname's Cordelia and I love\nto talk about colorful alternative makeup,\nalternative fashion,\nmental health and more.\nSo if these are things\nthat you're interested\nin talking about, please\nbe sure to hit that\nlittle subscribe button down below.\nAnd don't forget to ring\nthat bell so you never miss\nwhenever I upload a video.\nRight now, I upload videos\non Saturdays and Sundays\nand I try to upload as\nmany videos during the week\nas I possibly can.\nSo today's video is going to be on a new\nUrban Decay Chill Happy Palette.\nUrban Decay sent me this palette in PR,\nhowever, this is a palette I\nabsolutely would've purchased.\nThis is one of the two new\npalettes that Urban Decay\nhas released that I\nhave been excited about\nand it's been quite a while\nsince I've been excited\nabout Urban Decay's eyeshadows.\nSo check out this cool packaging.\nIt's very happy and fun.\nHere are the eyeshadow colors up close.\nFire, Brainwave, Upper, Happy\nTrap, Modern Mystic and Paz.\nI personally am in love\nwith this color story.\nIt is awesome, these are all\ncolors that I love to wear.\nIf you look through my tutorials,\nyou'll notice I have a lot\nof red tutorials, purple\ntutorials, even some pinks.\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ninsert swatches for you of this\npalette so you can see what\nit looks like on my skin.\nSo we have Paz which is an\nivory with a satin finish.\nWe have Modern Mystic,\nwhich is a coral pink matte.\nWe have Upper, which is\na magenta pink metallic.\nWe have Brainwave which\nis a black based purple\nwith purple pearl finish, it's gorgeous.\nWe have Happy Trap, which is\ndescribed as an ivory pink\nwith a shimmer finish, but\nto me this color looks more\nlike an ivory with a multicolored shimmer.\nAnd then we have Fire\nwhich is our red metallic\nwith multicolored shimmer.\nI love these colors.\nDon't you think these\nswatches look awesome?\nSo this Urban Decay eyeshadow\nformula is different\nfrom the one that I fell\nin love with in 2012\nbut it's also different\nfrom the formula of the past\ncouple years that I\njust haven't really been\nthat impressed with.\nI found these eyeshadows\nto be very easy for me\nto work with.\nThey are very, very\npretty, very impactful.\nI didn't really experience\na lot of fallout,\nlike I don't think I\nhad any fallout really\nfrom the eyeshadow itself.\nHowever, when I went to\nremove it all of the little\nmicro shimmers definitely\nI definitely ended up\nwith like some micro shimmers on my face.\nBut that's pretty much easy to clean up\nwith a makeup eraser.\nSo this new eyeshadow\npalette from Urban Decay is\nabout $33 and that breaks\ndown to about I think $5\nand 50 cents per eyeshadow\nsince they are six.\nI think that that is a pretty good value\nfor a little palette,\nespecially considering\nthat an individual Urban\nDecay eyeshadow now costs\nlike I don't know, $21 or $22.\nI definitely know it's\nmore than $18 these days.\nSo I feel like that's a pretty good value\nif you love these colors.\nLet's talk about the\ncolor story for a minute.\nI am in love with the color story.\nI love to wear reds and\npurples and even pinks\nand sometimes on occasion a\nlittle bit of like creamy beige,\nlike creamy beige on\nthe lid with with like\na burgundy wine color.\nI think this is a very fun color story.\nI don't know that I\nwould've originally chosen\nModern Mystic for one of the mattes\nbut I do find it a fun color to work with.\nIt definitely helps to keep\nthe looks like my looks lighter\nand brighter, so I really appreciate that.\nAnd it's easy to tone down\nModern Mystic with the color Paz\nwhich is like this creamy\nbeige that's great for\nerasing mistakes and\nhelping to blend things out.\nSo I feel like this is\nan excellent color story.\nI'm having a lot of fun with this palette.\nI would absolutely\ntravel with this palette.\nSo the Urban Decay Chill Happy Color Story\nis absolutely a color\nstory that I would use\nas a travel palette as well\nas an everyday palette.\nTo give you an example I\nhave taken the Urban Decay\nAphrodisiac Palette on my trip\nto Scotland, which I loved.\nLike this is another color\nstory that worked for me\nbecause I have lots of burgundies\nand had a couple creams.\nSo I am definitely a fan of\nUrban Decay's smaller palettes,\nand I especially love this\ncolor story, it does make me\nso happy, I think it\nis a great color story.\nAll right, so now let's\njump into the demo portion\nof this video where you\ncan see me put together\nseveral different eyeshadow\nlooks for hooded eyes.\nI'm gonna use a Goss 5\nbrush, but like a small tight\npencil brush would be great.\nAnd this color called\nBrainwave, which is like a\nblack-based purple with\nlots of purple shimmer.\nAnd I'm going to be creating\nan arch at the inner part\nof my eye.\nI'm gonna take a short angled\nbrush with the same color\nBrainwave and just extend\nthe shape out a little bit.\nBack to the Goss 5 brush.\nI'm going to apply this at\nthe like outer one fourth\nof my lower lid,\nand draw my wing pretty much\nstraight out so that I can\ncompensate for the excess skin that I have\nat the outer corner of my eye.\nI'm also gonna put this\nup at the upper lash line\njust a little bit to connect\nthe two and draw it out.\nI'm gonna use IT Cosmetics\n125 smokey liner brush\nand the color Fire.\nAnd I'm placing this under\nthe arch of the purple.\nI'm bringing it down in a little bit.\nAnd then I'm just gonna\ncontinue it along the arch\nof the purple here.\nAnd I'm going to take the same color Fire\nand drag it along the top.\nI'm gonna take another\nIT cosmetics 125 brush\nand the beautiful sparkly\npink here called Upper.\nI'm using Upper along the inner\nlower lid inner V of my eye.\nI'm connecting it up\nto the arch over here.\nI'm going to take it just\nat the tail of the color\nright here.\nI'm gonna use a Q-tip to\nshape because that's what\nI like to do.\nI'm gonna take the color Paz\nand this E20 brush from Sigma.\nAll right, does it says\nE20, yes, it's an E20,\nit's a short shader and I'm\njust gonna go blend around\nthe outside of the color.\nThis is a great eraser color\nfor helping you make sure\nthat your transition is smooth.\nI'm going to take the color\nright here, Happy Trap, which is\nlike a sparkly beige.\nAnd I'm putting that in between\nall of the other colors.\nI did use Urban Decay's All\nNighter spray on my brush\nto make the color damp and more intense.\nI'm so impressed by how\nthese colors performed.\nI'm so, so excited by them.\nAnd now to finish this look,\nI would obviously add mascara,\nput something on my water line,\nprobably tight line my eyes\nbut because this is an eyeshadow\ndemo, I'm gonna go ahead\nand take it off and do another\neyeshadow look for you.\nSo for that first eyeshadow\ndemo I used every single color\nexcept for Modern Mystic\nwhich is this peachy color\nright here, like a peachy orange.\nSo I'm going to create\na soft look with this.\nThis is the sort of look that\nI feel like I see a lot of\nwomen on TV wearing when\nthey're wearing like no makeup,\nmakeup or minimal makeup.\nI'm going to take this Modern Mystic color\nand this Sigma E27.\nIf you don't have a Sigma E27\nit's a brush that's basically\nflat one way and it's kind of\nrounded and you can flip it\nlike this or like this.\nAnd I think it's really great\nfor hooded eyes like mine.\nSo I loaded up the brush,\ntapped off the excess\nand I'm going to pop this\ninto the socket of my eye,\nthe crease of my eye.\nSo this is where like\nall of my excess skin is\nand why you don't really\nsee much of my mobile lid.\nAnd I'm going to start working\nit while it's flat like this\nback and forth through my crease\njust working on going like\nthis until I get enough color\nthat it feels like I have\na little bit of color here\nin the socket and you can see\nkind of see just a tiny\nlittle bit when it's open.\nThen I flip it like this,\nso it's horizontal now\nand I stick it right back\ninto the socket of my eye.\nI don't add any more product\nand I continue to blend it back\nand forth, working it in\nlittle circles as I go through\nthat socket.\nGoing to use this along\nmy lower lid as well.\nAnd I'm going to drag it out\ninto a little bit of like\na wing, even though we're\nnot like we're basically\nonly gonna create a shadow\nwing because I've seen so many\nladies on TV with this\nlook and I decided why not.\nIt's interesting to me\nit's, it's better than like\na standard, just no-makeup makeup look.\nI'm also putting a little\nbit of Modern Mystic at the\nouter corner of my lid.\nNow that I have that\nshape vaguely in place\nI'm going to take the color\nPaz which is this creamy ivory\nand I'm gonna take a Sigma E25,\njust a slightly larger version.\nAnd I'm gonna start blending\nat the edges of Modernistic.\nAnd if you find it's just\njust a little bit too bright\nor not exactly to your\nliking, you can always mix Paz\non top to lighten it.\nI'm going to take this color\nright here, Happy Trap.\nAnd this is a Sigma E54 medium sweeper\nand I'm just going to\nput this onto the lid.\nNow obviously I think\nthat this will look better\nif I put some mascara on,\nbut like I mentioned before,\nbecause I'm doing eyeshadow\ndemos I'm not gonna put\nmascara on until the last look.\nSo here is our just kind of neutral.\nFor the next look I'm gonna\nstart with the Urban Decay\nVice Pencil but any sort\nof purple eyeliner pencil\nbe will be great.\nAnd I'm going to outline\nmy eye, creating a cat eye,\na solid cat eye shape.\nSo I'm going along my lower lid.\nAnd because I have hooded\neyes, I draw my cat eyes\nfrom the bottom to make\nmy shape look better.\nIt helps with all of the\nexcess skin I have here\nbecause my excess skin\nhere, if I'm looking at you\nstraight on, it will cause\nthis to curve and arch down.\nNow to do the top part,\nI'm basically going to fit\nthis pencil just above\nthe socket of my eye.\nSo it's gonna just be\nbarely, barely visible\nwhen my eye is open.\nSo you can see there's my little\noutline that I'm gonna use\nand I'm taking this Sydney Grace brush.\nIt's kind of like a wider,\nwider flat domed sort of brush\nbut I'm going to use it to\npack Brainwave dry onto my lid.\nWhat I specifically like\nabout this shape of brush\nfor this look is that after\nI get all of the color\nonto my lid, I can go\nback and blend with it.\nI have like nice control\nover color placement,\nbut I can go through the\ncrease and sort of like\na windshield wiper motion,\nlike the socket of my eye\nand just smooth out that rounded top part,\ndo it along the wing,\nand I'm going to correct\nthe wing shape once I'm\nhappy with it with a Q-tip\n'cause that's how I like to do it.\nI know it can be very difficult\nto apply wings and cat eyes,\nstuff like this on hooded eyes\nbut this is one of the ways\nthat I have found that\nworks really well for me\nand I think it looks nice.\nBack with Paz which is that creamy shade.\nAnd I'm using a Sigma E20.\nSo very similar shape to\nwhat I was actually just\napplying with and I'm just\nblending along the edges.\nThis eyeshadow shape is\nactually one that I do a lot\nif I'm just going to\ndo like a colored base\nand then put a multi chrome on top.\nTaking an angled brush with a\nlittle bit more of the purple\nBrainwave, and I'm just\ngoing to sort of sharpen up\nthis wing out here before\nI hit it with a Q-tip\nto make it even sharper.\nThe last thing I'm gonna do\nis put a little highlight\nat the inner corner with Upper,\nit's the bright pink shade.\nAll right, so let me\nzoom in so you can see\nthis look up close.\nThis is a fun look to me for\na night out, if you wanna feel\nfierce 'cause I love\nhow like the shadow wing\ncat eyeliner feels and looks,\nI feel like it makes me look rawr.\nFor this look, we're gonna\nstart with Fire and I'm using\nIT Cosmetics Smoky liner brush.\nAnd I'm starting to just create\nlike color at the inner part\nof my eye.\nI'm gonna try to create a halo eye.\nBecause I have hooded eyes\nand a lot of excess skin\nat the outer corner of my\neye, whenever I am applying\neyeshadow, I always think\nabout how to shape that\nbecause I have all this\nexcess skin and if I don't\nthink about it, it will distort the look.\nI'm barely gonna connect\nthese two up here.\nI'm doing the lower lid,\nFire, love red eyeshadow.\nRed and purple are my\nfavorite eyeshadow colors.\nAlso quite fond of green and teal.\nAnd I'm taking another IT\nCosmetics smokey liner brush\nand I'm gonna start\nputting on the pink color.\nThe pink color is called Upper\nand I'm putting it inside\nwhere I put the red.\nI really love how easily\nthese shades blend together.\nI'm gonna take my Sigma\nE27 with a little bit\nof Modern Mystic and I'm just very lightly\ngoing over the edges.\nI wasn't sure how I would\nfeel about Modern Mystic\nas the only like deeper\nthan skin tone matte\nbut I think I really like it.\nIt's not a color I would\nnecessarily have picked out\nfor myself 'cause it\ndoes lean a little more\norange than peach.\nBut I do love peach shades and\noften find them a lot of fun\nto work with.\nGoing back with the Red Fire\nbuyer and a little bit of\nUrban Decay's All Nighter spray.\nI'm taking the color Brain Wave which is\nthe beautiful purple and I'm\ngonna start blending this\nalong the lower lid and I'm\ngonna use it to go up here\nat the inner V to add some depth.\nAnd then also at the outer V.\nI'm gonna take a Cozzette\nS185 which is very similar to\na Sigma E36.\nAnd I'm gonna take that same\npurple color Brain Wave.\nAgain, I'm going in at the\ninner V and I'm basically\njust keeping into the socket\nof the eye right there.\nI'm gonna do the same with\nthe outer part of the eye\nand use the socket as my guide.\nI'm going to take Karla\nCosmetics Drama Queen\nwhich is this beautiful opal\nmoonstone multi-chrome color\nand it has like hot pink and\ngold and orange and I'm taking\nDrama Queen on this small\nlittle Urban Decay brush\nand tapping it onto\nthe center of this eye.\nI like to use a damp with a\nlittle bit of Urban Decay's\nAll Nighter spray.\nGoing back with just a bit\nmore Upper on either side of\nwhere I put Drama Queen.\nNow that I have the eyeshadow\non I'm gonna show you how\nI tight line my eyes.\nI don't normally do this,\nbut I had a request for it.\nSo normally what I do is I'll\ntake my Nabla Cupid's Arrow\nand I'll put it along my lower lid.\nSorry, lower water line.\nAnd I love this pencil\nbecause it's super creamy.\nThen I like to take a bent\neyeliner brush like this\nto tight line the upper water line.\nI have very sensitive\neyes and I blink a lot\nwhen I'm doing this.\nBut getting right in at\nthe roots of the lashes\ngives someone with hooded\neyes more visible lid space\nif they have a little\nbit, and if they don't,\nwell it makes the most\nof whatever they have.\nAll right, so I just curled\nmy lashes and I added mascara.\nI used the Thrive Cosmetics mascara.\nSo let me zoom in so you\ncan see this finished look\nup close, this is the one\nI'm most excited about.\nAs you can see from the wide\nvariety of looks I was able\nto put together, this palette\nreally does have some of\nmy favorite eyeshadow colors to work with,\nsuch as the red and the\npurple and the pink.\nI love that I was able to\nmake this matte work for me.\nI feel like it's really easy to create\na daytime-appropriate look if\nyou're looking for something\nlike very minimal, with\nthese two colors and maybe\na little bit of sparkle from\nthis, but I love that this also\ncan bring the drama with\nthese three colors right here.\nAnd I'm especially happy with\nthis look that I put together.\nI really like all of the looks\nput together but I especially\nlove this one.\nI'm very pleased with the\nperformance of the eyeshadows.\nI'm really, really happy with them.\nSo this palette is, I\nbelieve this palette is $33\nand it's already live.\nIf you order it from Ulta,\nyou can use Ulta Points.\nIf you order order it from\nUrban Decay I think you can get\na free like eyeliner pencil with it.\nSo, depends on which way you wanna go.\nBut I am very happy with this palette.\nAs I mentioned, I would've\npurchased this for myself.\nI was planning on\npurchasing this for myself\nwhen I received it in PR.\nSo I'm very grateful for Urban Decay\nfor sending it to me, thank you.\nWhat do you think of this Urban\nDecay Chill Happy Palette?\nDo you love the cool little packaging?\nDo you love the color story?\nWhat about the looks I put together?\nLet me know your thoughts\nin the comments below.\nAlso, let me know how you\nlike this style of video.\nI would really like some\nfeedback because I'm not doing\nas many reviews like I had stated.\nWhat are your thoughts on\nthe Urban Decay Chill Happy Palette?\nAre you gonna pick it up?\nHow do you feel about the color story?\nWhat do you think about\nthe latest offerings\nfrom Urban Decay?\nLet me know.\nThank you so much for\nwatching, beautiful creatures.\nI love you and I'll\nsee you next time, bye.",

You can choose the coverage too, it\u2019s buildable. So if you picked a too intense color like wicked apple, you can put it on your finger and dab over your lips and it will look super natural but more flustered. 10/10 product",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

        "transcript_text": "The drug store\ncan be the most overwhelming place ever.\nAnd Sephora is literally.\nEven worse,\nthere are so many options for everything.\nWhere do you even begin\nif you're new here?\nHi, my name is Gaby and welcome to glam\ngirl Gabby, where I teach you simple\ntips and tricks\nthat will have you feeling as gorgeous\non the outside as you do on the inside.\nToday, we're going to be talking all about\nlipstick formulations.\nBecause how do you know what to choose\nwhen there are so many?\nI'm going to be showing you\neach formulation\non my beautiful model, Linda,\nwho is in her seventies and fabulous.\nAnd I'm also going to be showing you\neach formulation on myself because\nLinda has thinner lips and she's over 60\nand I have Fuller lips and I'm under 40.\nSo it's going to be nice to be able\nto visualize the differences\nin the formulations\non different people at different ages\nwith different genetics.\nLet's go.\nThe first formula that I want to talk\nabout is the tinted lip balm.\nIf you are prone\nto having dry or chapped lips\nand you often reach for lip balm anyways,\ngetting a tinted lip\nbalm may be an excellent option for you\nbecause you get a subtle flush of color\nand you get hydration in one.\nIf you are the type of person\nwho is super natural, this is a very easy\nway to add a pop of color to your face\nduring those like no makeup makeup days.\nIt's not fussy.\nIt's really not too much\neven if the rest of your face\nis completely bare.\nThe downfall of a product like this\nis that it doesn't last a long time at all\nand you will have to reapply\nit repeatedly throughout the day.\nSo where you benefit in\nlike the moisture and natural department,\nyou do have a downfall\nin the longevity of wear department.\nThese types of lipsticks also transfer\nvery easily on everything.\nThis is how it looks on Linda\nand this is how it looks on me.\nKeep a tally because in the comments\nI want to know\nwhich one is your favorite on her\nand which one is your favorite on me?\nLipstick.\nFormula two is the matte finish lipstick.\nNow, if you're looking for a lipstick\nthat provides you with much longer\nwear than a matte\nlipstick is a great option for that.\nThey are super saturated in their color\nand they leave the lips\nwith like a flat appearance\nthat has no sheen to it whatsoever,\neven though it still transfers it transfer\nsignificantly less than a moisture.\nRich lipstick does.\nSo what are the cons to this?\nDoes it transfer? It's saturate,\nit's long wear. What are the cons?\nRight.\nWell, the most obvious downfall\nis that this texture\ncan be uncomfortable for you\nbecause it's very drying.\nIt just doesn't have that\nlike moist, buttery feeling\nthat most people crave on their lips.\nAnother big downfall\nis that if you have smaller lips,\nit can make slips look much smaller.\nA moist appearance highlights that area\nand draw things forward,\nand a matte appearance creates like\na contour effect and recedes things back,\ntherefore making already small.\nLet's look smaller.\nIf you've watched any of my videos\non mature makeup application,\nyou'll probably have noticed\nthat I always talk about infusing radiance\ninto every step of your routine\nmatte lipsticks because they are drying.\nThey do have a tendency of making lips\nand the skin around the lips appear older.\nThis is how it looks on Linda.\nAnd this is how it looks on me,\nif you like the idea of a tinted bom.\nBut the pigment\nand the staying power of the matte,\nthen you can opt for a lipstick\nthat marries the two of them together.\nAnd that is the creme finish lipstick.\nThis is my favorite lipstick formula\nbecause it has the highlighting effect,\nthe bomb, the moisture of the bomb\nwith the extended wear time\nand the pigment of the matte\nof all the lipsticks.\nI looked up.\nThis one had the highest reviews.\nAnd I think it's just because most people\nlook very attractive in a cream formula.\nIt's a little bit fool proof.\nIt really does suit pretty much everyone.\nIt doesn't age the face,\nit doesn't age the lips.\nIt doesn't transfer that\nmuch a little bit, but not nearly as much\nas like a bomb does.\nSo what do you think about this one?\nDo you love it as much as we do?\nIf you're very attracted to a wet\nor a glass like finish on the lips,\nthen a gloss could be an excellent option\nfor you.\nHas come in a variety of formulations\nwith different pigment levels\nfrom sheer to opaque\nglosses have the lowest\nstaying power\nout of all the lip makeup options.\nIt's very easily transferred,\nvery easily transferred.\nIt gets on everything,\nbut it is beautiful\nand it can be used as a layering product.\nSo for example, you can use a matte\nlipstick for it's long wearing feature\nand then you can dab a little bit of gloss\nthe center of the bottom\nlip or to the Cupid's bow\njust to kind of elevate it.\nI almost never use a gloss on its own.\nI almost always use it\nas a layering product.\nBut if you're more of like a natural girl\nthat just wants a wash of color,\nthat's dewy\nand you know, that's really pretty,\nthen this could be a great option for you.\nThis is how it looks side by side on us.\nThe next option that is great\nthat a lot of people don't know\nabout is a Longworth stain with a bomb.\nThis is how it works.\nYou use the colored side\nto carefully outline\nand fill the lip in perfectly,\nand then you let it dry.\nOnce it's dry, you go over it.\nWith the bombing side, it ends up looking\njust like a cream lipstick,\nbut with zero transfer,\nalong with a lip color\nlike this could last you an entire day,\nwhich is absolutely amazing.\nSo what are the downfalls?\nRight. It's a lot of pros. You're like,\nwhat are the downs?\nThere's got to be a downfall.\nThere is like anything else,\nif you're not good at makeup, it can be\na bit tricky because you need extreme\nprecision since it's super opaque.\nAnd when it's on, it's on.\nIt's not easy to correct a mistake\nwith this type of lipstick.\nAnd I've seen it go wrong a lot on women\nwho aren't good at makeup\nbecause they don't\nget the precision in the lip line right.\nOr well enough.\nAnd it can make your lips\nlook a little bit wonky\nand then it's hard to correct it,\nyou know what I mean?\nLike, it's there, it's on. It's\nthat's it.\nLocking lips all day in terms of where\nif you don't reapply\nthe bomb often, it will dry itself out\nand crackle on the lips.\nThe next thing that I don't love about it\nis that lipsticks\nlike this\ntend to wear out in the moist areas first.\nSo like right in here.\nAnd they're really difficult to touch up\nbecause they're hard to remove.\nSo if you're home and you have like\nan oily makeup remover on hand, it's fine.\nYou can just take it off\nand put it back on.\nBut if you're out and about and you can't\nwipe it off, you can't reapply it,\nthe mistakes is going to be there.\nIt's kind of hard to correct when\nyou don't have makeup remover on hand.\nThat's a huge pain.\nEven with these\ndownfalls, though, in my opinion,\nthe benefits far outweigh the cons.\nSo try it out for yourself\nif you're intrigued.\nNothing is perfect, unfortunately,\nbut this one comes pretty darn close.\nIt comes pretty darn close\nto being perfect.\nI've left a list of every lipstick used\nwith this color in the description box.\nIf you're interested, this video's over.",

Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

Diese Dinger sind ja extra so konzipiert, dass sie die Haut reizen und damit die Lippen aufplustern. Ich glaube teilweise ist da auch so Chili, Pfefferminz und sowas drin. Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

        "transcript_text": "I just want to compare them with\nThe ordinary, Good molecules, and Inkey List.\nI think they are cheap La Mer essences\n. I only need 3 days to add the two of them together\n. My bad face has completely recovered . Hello\neveryone, I am Mudi,\nwelcome back to the channel and join me in scientific skin care\nand rational planting of grass.\nToday I will share my\nfavorite hyaluronic acid essence that I have used in the past year.\nFrom Top 5 to Top 1\n, but not only 5.\nThere are some parallel ones\nand comparisons of similar essences at the same price.\nHyaluronic acid The more I use it, the more I can\u2019t live without it,\nespecially after the age of 30.\nIt\u2019s obvious that the skin is a little sagging.\nIt can instantly restore the skin\n\u2019s elasticity and plumpness, just like\nyou go to get a Filler (filler), and\nit will look good on the mirror.\nIt \u2019s not only moisturizing. It can\nalso promote the healing of wounds\nand has a repairing effect on the wounded skin,\nshortening the time of my bad face\n. I will talk about the essences in a moment\n, which made me feel the repairing power\n. The fifth place is CeraVe's HA Essence Milk\nCerave Needless to say In the light of the US price offer,\nalmost none of the products are thunderous\n. This is what I said today. Among\nall the hyaluronic acid essences, it\nis the most moisturizing\nand moisturizing\n. It is very suitable for dry skin or mixed oil skin in autumn and winter. It is\na very classic triple ceramide. / Hyaluronic acid\nand\nvitamin B5 Vitamin B5 can quickly maintain stability when your skin is not feeling well or in a bad\ncondition , soothe your redness, improve\nwater retention and moisturizing power, and\nthe content of dimethicone in it is relatively high\n \n, so it It is very moisturizing,\nand it is more\nsuitable to be used after your functional essence\n. For example, after you have finished using retinol, your\nskin will feel a little\ndry, and then use it to reduce skin intolerance,\nreduce possible redness, swelling, itching and peeling\n. The texture is like lotion The same,\nI think it can replace your day cream or\nlight night cream\n, because it uses macromolecular hyaluronic acid\n, and its moisturizing power is the kind that covers the skin\ninstead of being eaten like a gel or essence\n, so if you use it too much before If you have multiple layers\n,\nit may rub mud. This is the only shortcoming I found\n, but its overall feeling of use is very good\n. If you are new to hyaluronic acid , especially\nif you have dry skin, I highly recommend it.\nThe fourth place is several raw material bucket brands\nThe Ordinary, good molecules, Inkey List,\nI like the ordinary\nand good molecules\n. Let me compare them. Let me\nfirst talk about my favorite\nmarine hyaluronic acid essence of the ordinary. I have been talking about it\nfor a few years\n. I think it is cheap La Mer Essence\nIt also adds a variety of algae and amino acids\n. It has skin-friendly marine flora,\nHawaiian glycoprotein\n \n, blue algae and other amino acids. The face is not greasy or sticky\nat all. It is not the glue\nof the original B5 hyaluronic acid.\nIt is very clear and moisturizing\n, and the water retention power will come out immediately after applying it\n. The skin is also elastic and moist on the second day. The addition of\namino acids\ncan help you smooth fine lines while moisturizing, and\nactivate your skin's defense mechanism\nto resist the external environment and bacterial erosion. I\nlike it very much. It is more\nadded than many big brands. By the way, these seaweed extracts are\nmore expensive . Good Molecule is also a new raw material barrel brand.\nIts texture is between the original version of the ordinary\nand marine hyaluronic acid. It\nhas 1% hyaluronic acid content, which\nis neither high nor low\n, not particularly refreshing.\nBut you can really\n \nfeel its water-holding and water-holding power\n. Like this kind of sticky one,\nI will apply it directly\n \non the face when the skin is half-dry or not dry.\nYou add a little moisture and it will be even better. It is\nmore comfortable and refreshing\n. This is also an essence that\nI really like after using it for a few weeks,\nso I also put it in the 4th\nplace . It is comparable to the marine essence\n, and it is even more suitable for dry skin than that.\nIt is the\nsame type of Inkey List. The ingredients are very simple,\nglycerin and hyaluronic\nacid, the texture is extremely light and thin,\nyou don\u2019t need to say that it\u2019s semi-dry and\nthen you\nput it on, it will feel very moisturizing when\n \nyou put it on your face when it\u2019s completely dry\n. I didn\u2019t\nfeel any changes in the skin\n, and the makeup did not become docile\n, as if it didn\u2019t exist after applying it\n. Its continuous moisturizing effect\nis not as good as the other two\n. And it\u2019s the packaging,\nit \u2019s not the same as before.\nIs it a dropper? It \u2019s like this\n, and then it will spill everywhere.\nYou need to wipe it after a while\n. The design is not very user-friendly\n, so this one is not included in my TOP 5\n. We are about to enter the top three\n.\nI really feel this hyaluronic acid.\nIt not only moisturizes\n, but also relieves the symptoms of my rotten face and\nreduces allergies . Unilipo\u2019s hyaluronic acid essence\nmakes sense . This brand is in Domestic partners are familiar with\nit. It\nis produced by Hometest Zhihu Dingma Laboratory\n. It is supported by a lot of data research\nand the ingredients are also very conscientious\n. The one in my hand is disposable.\nEvery time I take a bottle, it\nlooks like eye drops\nevery time.\nOne is a one-time dosage,\nwhich is more\nsuitable for you to travel\nor use in your cosmetic bag. It is the same\nas his 30ml one . Its formula is very powerful.\nIt is hyaluronic acid combined with medium molecules and large molecules\n. Like ordinary hyaluronic acid, it may only be large. Molecules\n, it only has the ability to grab water\n, and it has added middle molecules, which\ncan penetrate deep into the skin to reduce the volatilization of water\n, improve the texture of the skin\n, make the skin look more delicate\nand not so rough,\nthe whole hyaluronic acid is as high as 2.2\n2.2%, I can't believe it\nWith such a high content, it\ncan be so light and moisturizing\n. Its feeling of use is really not found in European and American brands. His\nformula allows hyaluronic acid\nto better\nexert its healing ability. The\nhydration effect of hyaluronic acid\nhe Increases the movement of interstitial cells\nFacilitates the movement of water around your wound\nThe stratum corneum is nourished Moisturize to\nshorten the duration of your allergies\n. My last bad face was (because) I tried a new skin care product. I\ncan\u2019t help it.\nI need to\ntry a lot of new products for everyone to test.\nThen I used it and my face got bad again.\nI thought to myself\n \nThen it will take a week to recover.\nI only use this hyaluronic acid\nand then use Cerave cream.\nThe cream is also very effective.\nCerave cream is a must for rotten face\n. I only use the two of them together for 3 days\n. My rotten face The face recovered completely.\nI know that if I just use a Cerave\n, it will definitely not be so fast.\nThe hyaluronic acid\nreally helped me heal the wound\nand repair the moisture barrier\n. The second place\nis the first aid beauty that I just emptied.\nHydrating serum is the most comprehensive essence that I talked about today. It has\nanti-oxidant, moisturizing, anti-free radical,\nanti-inflammatory and anti-allergic\nproperties\n. The ingredients are very comprehensive. It is\nsuitable for lazy people. You don\u2019t have to pick it up and use it immediately.\nTheir classic oatmeal extract , vitamin B5,\nfeverfew, tea extract,\nlicorice\nextract, and allantoin\n, I use it every time after using the radio frequency instrument\nand some beauty instruments\n. The skin explodes\nand moisturizes.\nThe power is overwhelming,\nthe sense of translucence came out , it is really moisturizing like a water light injection,\nit is a bit milky white\n, but it is a well-absorbed essence, many hyaluronic acid essences are just a flash in the pan, just\nnow I feel very moisturizing, and\nthe next day Is there any effect? \u200b\u200bAfter you apply\nthis,\n \nyour face will still be moisturized even if you don\u2019t use anything the next day.\nI highly recommend it\nto older people or mothers\nwho don\u2019t have\ntime to do skin care. They are\nvery tired and have to take care of their babies every day. If you don\u2019t have time to\nrest , if you stay up late, others won\u2019t notice\nit. It\u2019s also very moisturizing. Cerave, as I said just now, is very moisturizing\n.\nThe biggest difference between the two is\nthat Cerave, you feel that the moisturizing is floating on the skin,\nand the FAB is eaten into the skin\n. There is no dimethicone and no simethicone in it.\nIt is not the kind of nourishing moisturizer\n, but the kind of moisturizer that replenishes water\n. I don\u2019t know if you can understand\nit. The burden of FAB will be a little less .\nCerave is the kind of essence that has a sense of presence.\nThe first I would like to call it the Water Bomb\nEssence. It is the ultimate in hydration\n. Neutrogena\u2019s Hyaluronic Acid Essence\n. First look at this color. It \u2019s like\nyou\u2019ve fallen into the ocean\n. It\u2019s super blue , and\nit feels like you\u2019re surrounded by water\n. It\u2019s a real hydrating\nessence . Others say that you are oily on the outside and dry on the inside.\nYou are very oily\n, but if you want to replenish water, you can use it.\nIt\nis a gel essence that absorbs well. It is completely\nnon-sticky and very refreshing , but\nyou can feel its long-lasting moisturizing power, and\nthe skin is very smooth. It will not feel dry for a long time.\nLike\nthis time I went to Arizona to play.\nThe weather in the desert is cold\n, but the skin still feels very dry\n. What about me?\nI\nput a little water on the palm of my hand during the day\nand squeeze a drop. Lightly patted on the face, the skin feels super comfortable , and the water is replenished in an instant\n, and it will not damage the makeup\n. It is much faster than you use any moisturizing spray, and\nit lasts for a long time . Then you\nwill be hydrated at night and you don\u2019t need to pay special attention.\nMake a mask\n, because\nyou will feel very dry when you go to the desert\n, and you will desperately replenish water at night. After\nusing\nit\n, you will not feel the state of water shortage\n. The reason why it is so powerful is that it\ncontains 17% complex of water replenishment.\nThe hydrating complex\nthen includes hyaluronic acid\n, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid,\ntrehalose , various alcohol yeasts\n, and xylitol\n, which is a very\npowerful moisture absorbent that helps you catch water. Its\ningredients There is really nothing to say about the recipe.\nThe first place is well-deserved.\nThen I will say something similar to it.\nMany people will definitely ask me about the L\u2019Oreal product,\nwhich is\nabout the same price as $18. It looks like this,\nbut the L\u2019Oreal product contains fragrances , which can\u2019t be used on fragrance-sensitive skin,\nlet alone moisturizing and repairing\n. Then it\u2019s The ingredients are a bit ordinary compared to others,\njust basic glycerin and hyaluronic acid. The price/performance ratio is not as\ngood as Neutrogena \u2019s. Well, the above ones can be used for a whole year\n. My favorite hyaluronic acid is selected\naccording to your skin type\n. Use it for dry skin. If you have a slightly emulsion-\nlike oily skin, you can use the refreshing gel-like\nskin care step with hyaluronic acid added. You can\nobviously see the improvement in skin quality\n. If you want to see other collections, you can also leave a message\nbelow. If you have any questions, you can discuss them below\n.

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

        "transcript_text": "hey guys so for today's video we're doing\u00a0\nsomething pretty fun and kind of different\u00a0\u00a0\nand highly requested from you guys so the other\u00a0\nweek I posted a video where I recreated one of my\u00a0\u00a0\neyeshadow tutorials from 2016 with the Anastasia\u00a0\nModern Renaissance palette and in that video I\u00a0\u00a0\nactually bought a brand new eyeshadow palette\u00a0\nwhere I've had this one for seven years so I\u00a0\u00a0\nasked you guys in that video if you want to see\u00a0\na video of me comparing these two palettes and so\u00a0\u00a0\nmany of you guys said yes so that's exactly what\u00a0\nwe're doing today so like I said I've had this\u00a0\u00a0\nModern Renaissance palette for seven years now I\u00a0\ngot it in 2016 when it launched it is a beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nwell-loved palette I love this color combo but I\u00a0\njust kind of wanted to buy a new one since they\u00a0\u00a0\nstill sell it and it's probably a bestseller for\u00a0\nAnastasia and I really wanted to compare these\u00a0\u00a0\npalettes and see if they apply the same way and do\u00a0\nthe colors look the same way on the eyes how long\u00a0\u00a0\ndo they wear for so we will find out in this video\u00a0\nso I filmed this eye look for you and I'm wearing\u00a0\u00a0\nthe old palette on one eye and the new palette\u00a0\non the other I want to know right now do you see\u00a0\u00a0\na difference between my eyeshadow take a guess\u00a0\nright now if you can guess which eye is which\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich one is the seven year old palette and which\u00a0\none is the new palette so I'm going to show you\u00a0\u00a0\nhow I did this eye look today and I'm also going\u00a0\nto talk about anything I noticed as I was applying\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Shadows do the colors still look the same we\u00a0\nwill see I'm also going to do a wear test in this\u00a0\u00a0\nvideo so if you want to see how a seven-year-old\u00a0\nmono Renaissance palette compares to a new one\u00a0\u00a0\ngo ahead and keep on watching I don't mean to\u00a0\nbrag right now but my lighting looks absolutely\u00a0\u00a0\nperfect because it snowed like crazy yesterday\u00a0\nso I have my window open and I can see all the\u00a0\u00a0\nsnow and it's just like reflecting into my face\u00a0\nperfectly with my lights on so lighting is perfect\u00a0\u00a0\ntoday I'm excited for this video let me pop in my\u00a0\nWallace forget the filler little balm here I love\u00a0\u00a0\nthis so as I was planning for this video I was\u00a0\nthinking about doing swatches but I just kind of\u00a0\u00a0\ndecided against it because I feel like the point\u00a0\nof this video looking at a newer palette versus\u00a0\u00a0\nan older palette is really finding out how the\u00a0\nformula looks on your eyes the swatches should\u00a0\u00a0\nlook exactly the same because it is the same\u00a0\nexact palette like it's not like I'm using a dupe\u00a0\u00a0\npalette these are both from Anastasia bought from\u00a0\nlike a verified retailer so the shades should be\u00a0\u00a0\nexactly the same but I guess we'll see on the eyes\u00a0\nand that's what truly matters you know so my plan\u00a0\u00a0\nfor today is to do the exact same eyeshadow look\u00a0\nwith my two Modern Renaissance palettes I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nuse my old one that's seven years old on my left\u00a0\neye and my new one that I just bought a few weeks\u00a0\u00a0\nago on my right eye let's just take a quick look\u00a0\nat these palettes close up before I apply them\u00a0\u00a0\non my eyes so this is my seven-year-old palette\u00a0\nyou can see it is quite loved I have a pretty big\u00a0\u00a0\ndip happening in this burnt orange shade and then\u00a0\nhere is my brand new palette I've only used this\u00a0\u00a0\na handful of times I haven't even used ever every\u00a0\nshade yet from it I do plan on doing a wear test\u00a0\u00a0\ntoday as well I am kind of filming later in the\u00a0\nday but I'll wear this as long as I possibly can\u00a0\u00a0\nalright so let's dig into these eyeshadows I did\u00a0\nPrime my eyes the exact same way I used my rare\u00a0\u00a0\nBeauty eyeshadow primer and I did set my eyelids\u00a0\nwith the elf Halo glow a setting powder and I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of filming this a similar way that I do like\u00a0\nmy dupe videos where I'm gonna use the same exact\u00a0\u00a0\nbrushes but like a different set on each eye so\u00a0\nI'm not mixing and matching the formulas and let's\u00a0\u00a0\njust dive into this starting with the old palette\u00a0\nI'm going to take raw Sienna and a sigma e35 and\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen I pick up the shadow these Shadows do have a\u00a0\nlot of Kickback can you focus you can see all that\u00a0\u00a0\nin the palette that's pretty typical for Anastasia\u00a0\nshadows and it doesn't really bother me I just tap\u00a0\u00a0\noff the brush like this and then I apply the\u00a0\neyeshadow I do that every single time I pick\u00a0\u00a0\nup Shadow with an Anastasia palette alright so I'm\u00a0\ngoing to blend raw Sienna into my crease foreign\nI didn't scrape off like any layer of\u00a0\npowder on my old palette I'm literally\u00a0\u00a0\njust using it as it is I'm picking\u00a0\nup a little more shadow [Music]\nsplitting the shade into my crease it does seem to\u00a0\nbe applying as usual and like how I would expect\u00a0\u00a0\nit to now going into my new palette again with raw\u00a0\nSienna on a different e35 I'm expecting to have\u00a0\u00a0\nthe same kind of Kickback if I swirl it in there\u00a0\nkinda and yeah but again not a big deal to me\n[Music]\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't think I picked up the eyeshadow the\u00a0\nsame way as I did on the other brush so let\u00a0\u00a0\nme just dip in a couple more times and build\u00a0\nup this Shadow there we go that looks better\u00a0\u00a0\nI feel like I didn't pick up\u00a0\nenough on that first dip [Music]\nfor a second it almost looked like this I was a\u00a0\nlittle bit warmer than this eye they look the same\u00a0\u00a0\nright I feel like my brain's gonna play tricks\u00a0\non me during this whole makeup look I am going\u00a0\u00a0\nto touch up raw Sienna right here in this kind of\u00a0\ninner part of my crease I'm also going to do the\u00a0\u00a0\nsame thing on the other eye but with my other\u00a0\nbrush my eyes do tend to get just kind of dry\u00a0\u00a0\nright in this area so I think that might be what's\u00a0\nhappening all right so there is raw Sienna Blended\u00a0\u00a0\nin both of my creases I feel like right now they\u00a0\nlook exactly the same even just applying them and\u00a0\u00a0\nblending them in my crease I really didn't see or\u00a0\nfeel much of a difference now I'm going to take a\u00a0\u00a0\nsigma e25 in the shade realgar so I swirled my\u00a0\nbrush in there tapping off the excess and yes\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can see the eyeshadow picking up into the pan\u00a0\nagain this is the old palette and I am going to\u00a0\u00a0\nblend this into my crease more directly into my\u00a0\ncrease to kind of deepen it up this color combo\u00a0\u00a0\njust reminds me of like 2016 makeup just the kind\u00a0\nof like orangey warm toned smokey eye so pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nthough I say this a lot but in case you weren't\u00a0\nsubscribed Anastasia has my favorite eyeshadow\u00a0\u00a0\nformula like I just think they're the easiest\u00a0\nto work with they're the easiest to blend out\u00a0\u00a0\nI think the only downside is the kickback but then\u00a0\nagain personally that's not a big downside for me\u00a0\u00a0\num just kind of depends if that bothers you or\u00a0\nnot but I just love love her formula and like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe colors you see are exactly what you get\u00a0\non your eyelid I've had problems with Brands\u00a0\u00a0\nlike Huda Beauty where I see a shade in the\u00a0\npan and it doesn't look like what it does on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe pan on the eye which is kind of weird but I\u00a0\nnever have that problem with Anastasia Shadows\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so I only dipped into real guard once and\u00a0\nthis is how it looks in my crease not bad and\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing into the new palette and I'm using\u00a0\nthe tip of the e25 for this step foreign\n[Music]\nshade was slightly more pigmented with the new\u00a0\npalette but it could also be depending on like\u00a0\u00a0\nhow much Shadow I picked up maybe I didn't pick\u00a0\nup like the exact same amount of Shadow you know\u00a0\u00a0\ntrying my best here to make this as similar as\u00a0\npossible I think I want to kind of do a winged\u00a0\u00a0\nout shape so I'm going to go back to this eye\u00a0\nwith a little more real gar I'm gonna add that\u00a0\u00a0\nto the outer part of my lid and connect it into my\u00a0\nouter crease and then kind of flick it out [Music]\u00a0\u00a0\nand then doing the same thing with the new palette\n[Music]\u00a0\u00a0\nalright so there is real gar added to both outer\u00a0\ncorners and kind of winned out a little bit I feel\u00a0\u00a0\nlike they're still looking pretty similar\u00a0\nI am just going to take a skin tone colored\u00a0\u00a0\neyeshadow from a different palette and I'm just\u00a0\ngonna blend that around the edges on both eyes\u00a0\u00a0\num there isn't really a shade like this\u00a0\nin Anastasia's palette so that's why I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ndoing this this is just a step I\u00a0\nlike always do with my eyeshadow\u00a0\u00a0\njust to make sure the edges are like\u00a0\nreally Blended seamlessly foreign\non the same e25 I'm going to take red ocher\u00a0\nI'm in the old palette right now and I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to use that to deepen up this outer\u00a0\npart even more something a little more kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof like a burnt red color instead of that\u00a0\norange real gar I love this color so much\u00a0\u00a0\nit's not a color I use a lot anymore but\u00a0\nwhenever I put it on my eyes I just feel\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it looks so good on blue eyes and\u00a0\nsame thing in the new palette oh [Music]\nokay I tried really hard to pick up the Shadow\u00a0\nthe exact same way and it definitely feels more\u00a0\u00a0\npigmented on this eye like doesn't it just feel\u00a0\nlike it has kind of more depth to it than this\u00a0\u00a0\neye does even though it's the same exact color\u00a0\nall right so I'm actually gonna go back to the\u00a0\u00a0\nold eye and I'm gonna add more red ocher just\u00a0\nto try to even out the look here like I still\u00a0\u00a0\nwant my eyes to look even even if I have to add\u00a0\nmore Shadow on one eye than the other again we're\u00a0\u00a0\njust playing with how do these Shadows look when\u00a0\nyou first apply them I feel like that's kind of\u00a0\u00a0\ninteresting even after adding more to this eye I\u00a0\nstill feel like this eye just has like more depth\u00a0\u00a0\nto it do you see what I see I mean it's not like\u00a0\nsuper noticeable but if I'm looking at both eyes I\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely can see it now in the old palette I'm\u00a0\ngoing to take the shade of Primavera on a sigma\u00a0\u00a0\ne54 and that's going to go on this inner half of\u00a0\nmy lid that has no Shadow on it and I did not wet\u00a0\u00a0\nmy brush or anything this is just straight out\u00a0\nof the pan see how beautifully that applies I\u00a0\u00a0\nlove this I'm kind of going about halfway right\u00a0\nhere and then I'm going to take the e25 I used\u00a0\u00a0\non this eye kind of blend the shadow into the warm\u00a0\nShades out here and do a little blend around this\nand same thing in the new palette\n[Music]\nthen going back to the e25 doing the soft blend\nnow I'm going to take a sigma E21 with Cypress\u00a0\number from the old palette and I'm going to run\u00a0\u00a0\nthat along my top lash line as kind of a little\u00a0\neyeliner oh I'm getting a lot of Fallout with\u00a0\u00a0\nthis you see that I did tap off the brush too oh\u00a0\nthat is a lot of Fallout for a dark brown Shadow\u00a0\u00a0\nnot good okay well that's smeared everywhere\u00a0\nbut good thing I only have foundation on so I\u00a0\u00a0\ncan fix that later and same thing with the new\u00a0\npalette let's see if we still get that Fallout\nthank you\nokay I got significantly less Fallout on the\u00a0\nnew side which is very interesting like there's\u00a0\u00a0\nstill a little bit but definitely not as much\u00a0\nas there was on this side all right here's how\u00a0\u00a0\nthe eyelids are looking so far my plan now\u00a0\nis to do with the rest of my face makeup off\u00a0\u00a0\ncamera I'm gonna clean up this little bit\u00a0\nthen we'll do the lower lash line together\u00a0\u00a0\nfinish up the eyes and we'll talk about all\u00a0\nof my thoughts and feelings all right my face\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup is done let's work on the lower lash line\u00a0\nI'm gonna go back to the sigma E21 and I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\npick up antique bronze from the old palette and\u00a0\nI'm going to run that across my lower lash line\u00a0\u00a0\nI love using like a shimmery Brown\u00a0\non the lower lash line instead of a\u00a0\u00a0\nmatte Brown It's just so pretty it just\u00a0\nadds like a little bit of like Pizzazz I\u00a0\u00a0\nguess I think it's just more exciting than a\u00a0\nplain matte Brown I did dip in a second time\nand then I'll go back to the e25 I was\u00a0\nusing on this eye with nothing else on\u00a0\u00a0\nit and just kind of blend\u00a0\naround that brown [Music]\nnow I'm taking antique bronze from the new palette\n[Music]\ndefinitely got more Fallout on this\u00a0\neye and it also feels more pigmented\u00a0\u00a0\nas I first applied that I'm just\u00a0\ngoing to blend this out right away\nagain I'm trying really hard to pick up\u00a0\nthe same amount of product but this eye\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely looks more pigmented than this one\u00a0\non the lower lash line Sorry my lighting keeps\u00a0\u00a0\nchanging I am going to try to add more to\u00a0\nthis eye just to even the eyes out [Music]\nall right I think that's all I want\u00a0\nto do for the lower lash line kept\u00a0\u00a0\nit pretty simple with that antique\u00a0\nbronze shade now I'm going to take\u00a0\u00a0\nVermeer on a sigma E30 from the old\u00a0\npalette let's pop that in the inner\u00a0\u00a0\nCorner this is such a bright shade I love it\u00a0\nand then taking Vermeer from the new palette\nand then while I was doing my face makeup I\u00a0\nused the highlighter I used on my cheekbone\u00a0\u00a0\nunderneath my brow so that's what that is it's\u00a0\nthe rare Beauty highlighter obviously I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\ngo pop on some mascara and lashes finish up my\u00a0\nfull face and then we will talk about my final\u00a0\u00a0\nthoughts alright so I did something crazy today I\u00a0\nam not wearing fake eyelashes I've actually really\u00a0\u00a0\nbeen enjoying my natural lashes a lot recently\u00a0\nso no fake lashes today I'm just wearing the elf\u00a0\u00a0\nlash and roll mascara I've really been liking\u00a0\nthis it really is a good dupe for the benefit\u00a0\u00a0\nroller lash I completely agree this is beautiful\u00a0\nI just want to give you a little close-up of each\u00a0\u00a0\neye so again this is the older palette that is\u00a0\nseven years old and then this is the new palette\u00a0\u00a0\nall right and here is what the full face looks\u00a0\nlike on my lips I'm wearing the new elf o face\u00a0\u00a0\nsatin lipsticks in the shade no doubt I really\u00a0\nlike these lipsticks too elf is just like crushing\u00a0\u00a0\nit recently anyways the focus of today is the eye\u00a0\nshadow so here is like me pulled back looking at\u00a0\u00a0\nyou do you see any difference let me know right\u00a0\nnow like type it down let me know because honestly\u00a0\u00a0\nlooking at this final look I really don't see a\u00a0\ndifference and I wasn't really expecting to see\u00a0\u00a0\na difference straight up I've just kind of been\u00a0\nlike sitting here staring at myself looking at\u00a0\u00a0\nmy eyeshadow and on the eyes it looks exactly the\u00a0\nsame the only difference I really noticed is when\u00a0\u00a0\nI would use the new palette on this eye and like\u00a0\nfirst apply a shadow it did look more pigmented\u00a0\u00a0\nthan the old palette did but like formula wise\u00a0\nblending everything out shade wise it looks\u00a0\u00a0\nexactly the same to me all right it's currently\u00a0\n313 also look at my cute little and I'm gonna try\u00a0\u00a0\nto do another check-in or two before I take my\u00a0\nmakeup off for the day I'm expecting both eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nto wear the same like I guess I don't really\u00a0\nsee why they would wear differently if they\u00a0\u00a0\napplied exactly the same so we will see I'll check\u00a0\nback in in a few hours hello it is time for the\u00a0\u00a0\nfirst update it is currently about six o'clock so\u00a0\nI think I've been wearing this eyeshadow for about\u00a0\u00a0\nthree hours now and let's get up close here so\u00a0\nhere is what the seven-year-old palette eyeshadow\u00a0\u00a0\nlooks like and then here is the new palette\u00a0\nI'm honestly not seeing much of a difference\u00a0\u00a0\neverything still looks really good the blend looks\u00a0\ngood the colors still look nice and pigmented\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich again is what I expected I'll try to do one\u00a0\nmore check-in in a few hours or so okay this is\u00a0\u00a0\nthe best lady I can find what time is it it's 8\u00a0\n20. I need your opinion do my eyes look the same\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah I told you this earlier this\u00a0\none look better than the other no\u00a0\u00a0\nit won't look better than the other they wouldn't\u00a0\nlook the same which one do you think is which\nwhat all right so I didn't really film like a\u00a0\nformal outro so here it is I really feel like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe eyeshadow kind of spoke for itself like\u00a0\nboth eyes wore completely the same my makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nstill looks so good by the end of the night like\u00a0\nI was kind of shook but I was like dang I love\u00a0\u00a0\nAnastasia Shadows so again the only difference\u00a0\nI really saw between the palettes was when I\u00a0\u00a0\nwould apply the new palette on my right eye\u00a0\nlike the shades just look more pigmented in\u00a0\u00a0\ngeneral the shades were still like exactly the\u00a0\nsame they just had like a little more depth to\u00a0\u00a0\nthem but I do feel like I was able to make my\u00a0\neyeshadow look the same if I would add more of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe old palette to the old eyes I guess the\u00a0\nquestion we were trying to answer is does a\u00a0\u00a0\nseven-year-old palette still perform the same\u00a0\nas a new eyeshadow palette for the most part I\u00a0\u00a0\nwould say yes I'm sure if I were to like scrape\u00a0\noff the top layer of each of the old eyeshadows\u00a0\u00a0\nit probably would perform almost exactly the same\u00a0\nas the new palette but like I said I just wanted\u00a0\u00a0\nto apply the palette as it is and as it's been\u00a0\nsitting in my collection for seven years I also\u00a0\u00a0\nwanted to mention that I did have zero problem\u00a0\nproblems with my eyes or any irritation after\u00a0\u00a0\ntaking my makeup off today is the next day my\u00a0\neyes feel and look completely fine because I\u00a0\u00a0\nknow that is a worry that some people have about\u00a0\nolder eyeshadow palettes but I didn't have any\u00a0\u00a0\nproblems with using an old palette on my eyes\u00a0\nso I guess it's kind of up to you if you feel\u00a0\u00a0\ncomfortable using an older palette on your\u00a0\neyes I say it performs pretty much exactly\u00a0\u00a0\nthe same as a new palette so I say go ahead\u00a0\nand use your old Anastasia palettes but again\u00a0\u00a0\nbe cautious if you tend to have sensitive eyes\u00a0\nmaybe this won't work for you but I don't have\u00a0\u00a0\nsensitive eyes so it worked fine for me so this\u00a0\nwas a super fun video to film I'm Still Loving\u00a0\u00a0\nusing my model Renaissance palette I'm actually\u00a0\nwearing it on my eyes again today like it's just\u00a0\u00a0\nfun having this out on my table again and\u00a0\ngetting more use out of it so I hope you\u00a0\u00a0\nguys enjoyed this video thank you so much for\u00a0\nwatching and don't forget to like And subscribe",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

today the huda beauty sapphire obsession\u00a0\u00a0\npalette this has a nice selection of blues in here\u00a0\nand what we're gonna do next is go right into this\u00a0\u00a0\ndark blue right here and i'm gonna put it in the\u00a0\nouter corner and kind of bring it into the crease\u00a0\u00a0\nslowly we'll see how this goes i'm gonna use\u00a0\nthis jeffree star morphe brush this is the js6\u00a0\u00a0\nbrush it's more of a pointy fluffy brush\u00a0\u00a0\noh let's see how this is gonna look i'm\u00a0\njust gonna keep it in the outer corner\nhere oh look at that blue okay i'm gonna\u00a0\nuse the first brush and smudge it in a bit\nokay so let's make this a little bit more\u00a0\ndarker here and kind of bring it into the crease\nbut i want this to be much darker than this blue\u00a0\nso i'm gonna add a little bit of a black shadow\u00a0\u00a0\nto it and kind of smudge it on top to give it\u00a0\nmore of that nice dark blue instead of that light\nblue\nso that kind of like intensified that light\u00a0\nblue a little bit more so we're gonna do the\u00a0\u00a0\nsame thing on this eye i'm gonna add this blue\u00a0\nin the outer corner here and now we're gonna add\u00a0\u00a0\nthe same thing a little bit of black okay so now\u00a0\ntrust the process we're gonna use a blending brush\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm gonna use this crown pro blending brush and\u00a0\nkind of diffuse the sharp ends here and then you\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to diffuse this sharp line so to do that i'm\u00a0\ngoing to go back into that nice brown and add it\u00a0\u00a0\non top over there where the blue ends and kind of\u00a0\nthat kind of diffuses this harsh line in this blue\u00a0\u00a0\nshade now let's go we have a couple blues here\u00a0\ni'm thinking let's see this one how it looks\u00a0\u00a0\neither this one oh look at that or this one i\u00a0\nlike this one i think yeah i think i'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\ngo with this blue and we're gonna add it in the\u00a0\nmiddle of the eye with the finger just like this\u00a0\u00a0\nso we're gonna leave the inner corner\u00a0\nopen because we're gonna use silver\nthis is a blue silver smoky eye\u00a0\ntutorial so again you can use\u00a0\u00a0\nthis eyeshadow tutorial with any colors\u00a0\nyou want you can use greens you can use\u00a0\u00a0\npurples and pinks and this is kind of to give\u00a0\nyou a guideline on where i apply my eye colors\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful so for the inner corner we're gonna\u00a0\ngo ahead and use this beautiful tart palette\u00a0\u00a0\nand i love this palette because it has this\u00a0\nnice silver and nice gold and this is the\u00a0\u00a0\nfoil finger paints lunar palette this i don't use\u00a0\nas much because you need you need glitter glue\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm gonna go into this foiled one i'll show\u00a0\nyou right here how it looks it's so pretty look at\u00a0\u00a0\nthat it's like applying foil on your eyelids and\u00a0\ni'm gonna use this in the inner corner here ah oh\nbeautiful look at that now that is beautiful so\u00a0\nwith this one look i've left the left over and\u00a0\u00a0\nit's still a lot on my hand with this one you\u00a0\nget another kind of clean brush so i'm going\u00a0\u00a0\nto get this fluffy moda brush and go in here and\u00a0\ndiffuse and combine those colors together so we\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't have any harsh lines now don't worry about\u00a0\nthis we're gonna clean it with some concealer okay\nso if you have gone beyond the point where it's\u00a0\nyou came too low with your eye shadow you add a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle bit of concealer and then you use your\u00a0\nsponge and kind of clean it upwards like this\u00a0\u00a0\nit gives it a nice foxy eye type of look now for\u00a0\nthe bottom lash line i have this nice pencil by\u00a0\u00a0\npixie by petra and it's in the shade slate\u00a0\ngray it's the endless silky eye pencil and\u00a0\u00a0\nit is literally so silky and smooth on your\u00a0\nhand i'll show you and it's kind of this gray\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor it looks kind of black but it's like a\u00a0\nnice dark gray so i'm going to add this on the\u00a0\u00a0\nbottom lash line like this and then we're\u00a0\ngoing to smudge it and add some blue to it\nso i'd like to go with this one because\u00a0\nit looks like it has a shift of blue in it\nbut it's a nice gray look how nice it makes\u00a0\nthe eye let's do the same thing on this eye\u00a0\u00a0\nnow i'm gonna add this blue the\u00a0\ndark blue that we first used\u00a0\u00a0\non top of this line and we're\u00a0\ngonna smudge them together\nlook how beautiful that looks and there you have\u00a0\nit let me zoom you guys in so you guys can see\u00a0\u00a0\nhow everything turned out with the shadows i\u00a0\nthink it looks very beautiful let me know down\u00a0\u00a0\nin the comments below what you guys think of this\u00a0\nblue look now don't go away because we're not done\u00a0\u00a0\ni will have a small intermission and i'm gonna go\u00a0\nahead and apply the pat mcgrath fetish eye mascara\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm still testing this mascara to see how i really\u00a0\nfeel about it i've heard good things about it so\u00a0\u00a0\nstay tuned and i will be right back\nso welcome back hope you enjoyed the\u00a0\nintermission i've applied this mascara\u00a0\u00a0\nnow my thoughts it does it does create beautiful\u00a0\nlashes as you can see i've used this on the\u00a0\u00a0\ntop lashes and i've used my favorite wet and\u00a0\nwild mega length mascara on the bottom lashes\u00a0\u00a0\ni feel that this this is a beautiful\u00a0\nmascara it does lengthen it does volumize\u00a0\u00a0\nbut if you look at the wand when you take out\u00a0\nthe product look how much product is wasted and\u00a0\u00a0\nstuck to the top of the wand and all over the\u00a0\nwand so i feel like this is very hard to use on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe bottom lashes because you can really easily\u00a0\ntouch the skin and smudge your makeup with it so\u00a0\u00a0\nit is beautiful i'd love to use this on the top\u00a0\nand i'd like to use a thinner wand on the bottom\u00a0\u00a0\nbut yeah it does what it says volumizes lengthens\u00a0\nuses a lot of product though and gets stuck to\u00a0\u00a0\nthe wand so that's one thing i don't like about it\u00a0\nbut i'm still happy to have this in my collection\u00a0\u00a0\nso now that the mascara is done all we\u00a0\nhave is lips now for lips i think i'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nuse a brown lipstick today and i'm gonna\u00a0\nuse the colourpop lippy pencil in the shade\u00a0\u00a0\nanother round which is this one right\u00a0\nhere let's go ahead and line the lips\nso for the lips i'm going to keep it simple\u00a0\ni'm just going to use this liner i filled in my\u00a0\u00a0\nlips because you wouldn't want to take away from\u00a0\nthe smoky eye and of course i'm top i'm gonna go\u00a0\u00a0\nwith one of my favorites this is the maybelline\u00a0\nlip gloss this is the lifter gloss with

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

Was mich definitiv interessieren w\u00fcrde w\u00e4ren gut reflektierende und nicht zu glitzerige Highlighter. Ich war nie ne Highlighter-Person und teste mich da gerade erst durch. Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

Diese Dinger sind ja extra so konzipiert, dass sie die Haut reizen und damit die Lippen aufplustern. Ich glaube teilweise ist da auch so Chili, Pfefferminz und sowas drin. Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle bit on the back of my hand now you can\u00a0\nuse a palette or the back of your hand you can\u00a0\u00a0\napply this with your fingertips I'm going to go\u00a0\nin with a brush so again this is the Merit I love\u00a0\u00a0\nthis brush for applying contour for blending out\u00a0\nblush for applying foundation this is one of my\u00a0\u00a0\nfavorite favorite brushes I will link everything\u00a0\nI've listed Down Below in the description you guys\u00a0\u00a0\ncan see it all there and if you're interested\u00a0\nin this one definitely pick it up it's stunning\u00a0\u00a0\nlove it so I'm just going to take my brush\u00a0\nand tap it in just to warm up that bronzer\u00a0\u00a0\nwe have a little bit on our brush we're just\u00a0\ngoing to start at our forehead and tap tap tap\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so the color is really really pretty\u00a0\nso this is actually the lightest shade that\u00a0\u00a0\nSephora carries they don't actually carry\u00a0\nSunshine which is the fair bronze shade\u00a0\u00a0\nthere were two shades that Sephora didn't carry\u00a0\nwhich is disappointing because I would have\u00a0\u00a0\npicked up probably the lighter shade and used this\u00a0\nshade as more of a contour now I'm just taking the\u00a0\u00a0\ndry side of my brush and I'm just blending that\u00a0\nout it is drying down fast but not too fast you\u00a0\u00a0\nstill can get a really good blend with it now\u00a0\nyou can go in with your ring finger and just\u00a0\u00a0\nbuff out the edges or go in with another dry\u00a0\nbrush talking about the color I think it's a\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful color I have nothing on this side of my\u00a0\nface and I've just bronzed so far this side super\u00a0\u00a0\npretty love the shade it's not terribly orangey\u00a0\nit's not you know doesn't give you that kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nglowy vibe but for a cream this is actually\u00a0\nreally pretty and it Blends out really nice\u00a0\u00a0\nand it's not emphasizing pores or lines nothing\u00a0\nsuper dramatic now I'm going to take what's\u00a0\u00a0\nleft I'm going to actually just go here on my\u00a0\njawline this is just going to help snatch that\u00a0\u00a0\nface making it look a little bit thinner on this\u00a0\nside normally I would go in with a contour but\u00a0\u00a0\ndepending on how tanned you are I usually go in\u00a0\nwith a little bit of bronzer there too just kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof making everything look cohesive I'm actually\u00a0\nsuper impressed with this right that night and\u00a0\u00a0\nday difference I'm wow I'm impressed now let's\u00a0\ngo in and blend this in with our fingers on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe other side not a method I love you guys know\u00a0\nthis but you guys really like to blend with your\u00a0\u00a0\nfingers so I thought we would try it now this has\u00a0\ncompletely dried down on my hand so this is a very\u00a0\u00a0\nfast drying product like it's it's dry so keep\u00a0\nthat in mind when you guys are blending it out\u00a0\u00a0\nit does dry down quite fast so I'm just gonna\u00a0\nsqueeze out just a little bit more tiny bit\u00a0\u00a0\nwith my ring finger we're just going to take that\u00a0\ndab it in and Dot so I'm going to dot right here\u00a0\u00a0\nhere here here here bring this down right here\u00a0\njust on top of my blush and then I'll blend it\u00a0\u00a0\nout with my fingers so I'm taking the two clean\u00a0\nfingers here and we're just going to blend that\u00a0\u00a0\ninto our hairline small circular motions I hate\u00a0\nthis method but you guys seem to like it yeah okay\u00a0\u00a0\nI can't handle it we're just gonna blend it out\u00a0\nwith the brush it dries down way too fast for that\nyeah totally messy and I prefer it with the\u00a0\nbrush but not gonna lie to you guys like I tried\u00a0\u00a0\nbut literally it was drying down way too fast\u00a0\nokay so I did try to go in and blend it with\u00a0\u00a0\nmy fingers but for me it looks patchy here\u00a0\nand I'm having a hard time blending that out\u00a0\u00a0\nit's just one of those things it just dries down\u00a0\ntoo fast I would not recommend going in with\u00a0\u00a0\nyour fingers also something I don't like about\u00a0\nthis product is when I do try and blend it out\u00a0\u00a0\nwith my fingers which is something I wouldn't\u00a0\nnormally do I feel like you get that Halo that\u00a0\u00a0\nyou don't want that like mask of demarcation\u00a0\nline where it's like orange kind of in your\u00a0\u00a0\nhairline if you go in and blend this out with a\u00a0\nbrush especially this one here by Merit love it\u00a0\u00a0\nyou don't get that you just blend it right in it\u00a0\nlooks amazing but if you try and blend it in with\u00a0\u00a0\nanything else it's just a hot mess you've got that\u00a0\nline of demarcation which I will take a dampen\u00a0\u00a0\nBeauty sponge right here I'm just going to see\u00a0\nif I can blend that out okay it's not bad so if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou do make a mistake with this product you can go\u00a0\nin with a lightly dampened Beauty sponge and just\u00a0\u00a0\nblend it out it is kind of removing a bit of the\u00a0\nproduct as well but in this case it is diffusing\u00a0\u00a0\nit so if you do put on a little bit too much\u00a0\nit's not horrible where it's patchy right here\nit's fixing it so I'm not terribly mad at it\u00a0\nit's just one of those products that you really\u00a0\u00a0\nhave to work really fast with to blend out here\u00a0\nare some of the things I like about it and some\u00a0\u00a0\nthings I don't all right definitely the blend\u00a0\ndown time it is fast you need to work very very\u00a0\u00a0\nfast don't love that so much about the product\u00a0\nthis would be great on a body on the legs you\u00a0\u00a0\ncould really bronze this up and it's not going to\u00a0\nbudge I can go like this until the cows come home\u00a0\u00a0\nwith a dry finger and it's not moving like I mean\u00a0\nI'm really pushing hard and it's not moving so\u00a0\u00a0\nthat is something I super love about this product\u00a0\nbut if you go in and blend it out with anything\u00a0\u00a0\nbut a really good brush you're going to have some\u00a0\npatchiness don't love that but it does blend out\u00a0\u00a0\nreally really well with the sponge so you're good\u00a0\nyou're golden this is going to work as an eraser\u00a0\u00a0\nand a lifesaver tool for you guys super good tip\u00a0\ndo I love the product I think it's really really\u00a0\u00a0\namazing and pretty definitely pretty I would like\u00a0\nto see Sephora carry the lighter shade because I\u00a0\u00a0\nwould like to try that when I was as well if you\u00a0\nguys want the lighter shade definitely pick it up\u00a0\u00a0\non the Laura Mercier website some of the pro tips\u00a0\nthat she has on her website is that you can blend\u00a0\u00a0\nthis in with a moisturizer if you want just more\u00a0\nof a moisturized but tinted look you could also\u00a0\u00a0\ndo that you could also blend this in with your\u00a0\nfoundation if you don't want it to be so harsh do\u00a0\u00a0\nthat as well today I just put it on over top of\u00a0\nmy Foundation but you can also under paint with\u00a0\u00a0\nthis and I think it'll be beautiful definitely try\u00a0\nthose out let me know in the comments down below\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat you guys think if you guys haven't seen\u00a0\nmy latest video on the Charlotte Tilbury matte\u00a0\u00a0\nBeauty blush ones check it out right now alright\u00a0\nguys until next time love and lip gloss bye",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde.

Diese Dinger sind ja extra so konzipiert, dass sie die Haut reizen und damit die Lippen aufplustern. Ich glaube teilweise ist da auch so Chili, Pfefferminz und sowas drin. Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

video\u00a0\nwith a bang but I am going to be diving into a\u00a0\u00a0\nbunch of the spring releases from Jason moo look\u00a0\nat this quad look at this pastel palette I have\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a liquid Shadow we have some face palettes\u00a0\nI even have one more I am very intrigued it's\u00a0\u00a0\nbasically going to be a full face of Jason\u00a0\nWu and we're gonna see if this brand is good\u00a0\u00a0\nor not because I will say just looking at these\u00a0\ntwo things this is pretty much the most exciting\u00a0\u00a0\nthing I've seen at the drugstore in a I want\u00a0\nto say half minute but like in the Millennia\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm super excited and if you haven't been there\u00a0\nbefore do consider subscribing I do upload quite\u00a0\u00a0\na lot of videos every week all about makeup All\u00a0\nAbout Beauty I love trying drugstore high-end\u00a0\u00a0\nIndie makeup I love doing colorful things\u00a0\nand that's definitely what we're doing today\nI am actually going to be using the Jason Wu\u00a0\nTinted Moisturizer meets CC cream I have used this\u00a0\u00a0\nbefore I have reviewed this before I really like\u00a0\nit I think it is very let me actually see if I\u00a0\u00a0\ncan get some hold get some like clippity clips and\u00a0\njust get the hair out of the face because that is\u00a0\u00a0\none of my pet peeves when I say makeup videos and\u00a0\npeople are just like putting makeup in their hairs\u00a0\u00a0\nplease pull your bangs back okay nobody wants\u00a0\nto see that I'm actually going to be using\u00a0\u00a0\nit with this glow recipe strawberry um BHA\u00a0\nprimer I have been using this a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nas of late it definitely is not poor filling\u00a0\nbut I also myself do not have a problem with\u00a0\u00a0\npores but it really does keep your face matte\u00a0\nso if your problem is an oily T-Zone or maybe\u00a0\u00a0\nyour whole face is oily I do think that this one\u00a0\nmakes a difference I'm still in the process of\u00a0\u00a0\nreviewing it so I'm like trying it out with a lot\u00a0\nof different foundations like that I know like\u00a0\u00a0\nI know how this one works and I really do like\u00a0\nthis one I have done a video actually which was\u00a0\u00a0\nlike half face drugstore half face high end and I\u00a0\ncompared this one to the Charlotte til Breeze my\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful skin this is a very very similar thing\u00a0\nthis one says that it is a tinted moisturizing\u00a0\u00a0\nmeat CC cream which basically just means that\u00a0\nit's like it has some coverage to it but there\u00a0\u00a0\nare like a little bit more skincareing ingredients\u00a0\nthat is a hair for sure I would say that this is a\u00a0\u00a0\nglowy but not dewy medium coverage Foundation\u00a0\nthat is a little bit more gel like inconsistency\u00a0\u00a0\nlike the Charlotte he'll breathe um my beautiful\u00a0\nskin Foundation they are very very similar in my\u00a0\u00a0\nhumble opinion this one I bought myself I bought\u00a0\nthis off Target you can find this brand at Target\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I will say all of the other things that I'm\u00a0\ngoing to be showing you I actually got from skin\u00a0\u00a0\nstore and I did get those as PR I did request\u00a0\nthem myself as PR I should say so I didn't pay\u00a0\u00a0\nfor the other things in this video but this video\u00a0\nis not sponsored but I do have a code with skin\u00a0\u00a0\nstore which brings the price down so if you were\u00a0\ninterested in this brand I would kind of recommend\u00a0\u00a0\nyou to order it from skin store because then you\u00a0\ncan get some money off with my code Angelic SS I\u00a0\u00a0\nwill put that down below I will also link it\u00a0\nat Target if you feel like that is more your\u00a0\u00a0\nJive but if you want to save some money I would\u00a0\ndefinitely say go to skin store because it is\u00a0\u00a0\nbasically the same price just that you can get a\u00a0\ndiscount on it I don't have any uh powder I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nthink they have a concealer but I didn't pick\u00a0\nup a powder and didn't pick up a mascara so I\u00a0\u00a0\nwill be using that from another brand and I also\u00a0\ndidn't pick up any brow products so let me just\u00a0\u00a0\ndo like concealer powder and brow products and\u00a0\nI'll be back I will put all the things that I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nusing down below including links in case you're\u00a0\ninterested and in case you're like what did she\u00a0\u00a0\ntalk about what shade was that where can I find\u00a0\nit everything's in the description box the first\u00a0\u00a0\nthing I'm going to be trying out is this Jason Wu\u00a0\nbronzer palette and I thought this was interesting\u00a0\u00a0\nI will say the packaging a little cheapy but it's\u00a0\nbecause it's sold at a drugstore so it needs to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe like clear so that people can see it because\u00a0\nthere's no tester so I'll be your tester I'll take\u00a0\u00a0\none for the team I think I will be using this\u00a0\none in the middle maybe even blend it out with\u00a0\u00a0\nthis lightest one just to make sure how it's gonna\u00a0\nlook it looks like it's going to be a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nmore on the cooler side which isn't normally my\u00a0\nJive when it comes to like bronzers and stuff so\u00a0\u00a0\nI think I'm gonna keep it up here so that because\u00a0\nif I pull down something too far that has a cool\u00a0\u00a0\ntone it clashes with my neutral golden undertone\u00a0\nand just makes me look a little ghoulish so when I\u00a0\u00a0\nuse something that's a little bit more cool toned\u00a0\nI need to keep it up towards here otherwise it's\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna look a little Halloweeny but I will say\u00a0\nit goes on really nice it Blends really nice\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm just not gonna bring it down too much I'm\u00a0\ngonna keep it like that I mean I do have blush\u00a0\u00a0\nto use as well so it's going to be totally fine\u00a0\nI'm not going to use any in my forehead because\u00a0\u00a0\nI have a very small forehead and I\u00a0\ndon't need to be contouring that at all\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm actually just gonna keep it like this for\u00a0\na little definition there's also a blush palette\u00a0\u00a0\nthere were several different colors to choose from\u00a0\nand I chose this one oh wait there's a plastic\u00a0\u00a0\nhere because it has this orange I don't know if\u00a0\nyou can see it's like super bright there are two\u00a0\u00a0\nlike really nice like peachy mauvy neutrally\u00a0\nShades here as well but this bright orange\nwe all know I needed to try that\u00a0\none right so let's try that one\nreally pretty\nit is pigmented but not overly pigmented you\u00a0\nknow I don't like blushes there are like overly\u00a0\u00a0\npigmented because it just becomes too much too\u00a0\nfast I don't mind pigment and I really like when\u00a0\u00a0\nthe blush is buildable because that means that you\u00a0\ncan decide how much pigment you want I just don't\u00a0\u00a0\nlike when it's like overly pigmented and like\u00a0\nthe blush decides for you this is the pigment\u00a0\u00a0\nthese are your only options this one seemed a\u00a0\nlittle bit more it doesn't smell the greatest\u00a0\u00a0\nthough I will say it can be though sometimes you\u00a0\ncan smell like the glue in some makeup and I feel\u00a0\u00a0\nlike maybe that could be the case here I feel\u00a0\nlike this one came down a little bit too far\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe we'll use a little bit of this lightest\u00a0\none and just see if we can blend that down\nbecause that's like it's like a\u00a0\ncontour and bronzer palette this one\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'm just using this one it has a little\u00a0\nbit of a Sheen to it it's not like fully\u00a0\u00a0\nmatte which can be nice sometimes it's nice to\u00a0\nhave like a a lighter Contour shade that has a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle bit of a Luminosity to it it usually\u00a0\nworks out really good like on the forehead\u00a0\u00a0\nokie dokie there's a highlighter palette there is\u00a0\na highlighter palette look at how this one looks\nlet's let's actually just Swatch it\u00a0\non our fingers that that's very glowy\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm definitely going to be using this Goldy one\u00a0\nbecause like I said I do have you can probably\u00a0\u00a0\ntell when I put this next to my skin that if\u00a0\nI have the pink and the gold next to my skin\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can definitely see that I'm leaning a\u00a0\nlot more on the golden side so I'm going to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe using this golden highlighter but wow\u00a0\nthat's let's see how this is on the skin\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's pretty impressive okay so\u00a0\nwe're doing this middle golden shade\nyeah that is very highlighty actually looks\u00a0\nreally nice on the skin it goes on very thin\ndoesn't look like chunky on the skin huh\u00a0\nthat's actually a really nice highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\nformula and I definitely don't feel\u00a0\nlike I see it it looks really good\u00a0\u00a0\nit doesn't look chunky it doesn't look glittery\u00a0\nit looks a little bit like a highlighted wet look\nthis is a nice highlighter formula\u00a0\nI really do approve this one\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't want to say that I'm surprised but\u00a0\nevery time I find something that's like\u00a0\u00a0\nreally affordable because I mean\u00a0\nthese are three full size highlighters\u00a0\u00a0\nand again if you use a code you can get even\u00a0\nmore of a discount and that's a nice formula\nwould be nice I have two different\u00a0\nlip formulas to try out one of them is\u00a0\u00a0\nhey a matte lipstick really like this color I\u00a0\nalso have a I think this is like a matte like\u00a0\u00a0\nmatte lip cream smells just like ingredients\u00a0\nthat's a nice color too like a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nmore terracotta almost but I also have a lip\u00a0\nliner so that's I guess three lip products then\u00a0\u00a0\nso let's start with this one this lip liner\u00a0\nit feels very substantial the color of like\u00a0\u00a0\njust how this looks it looks exactly\u00a0\nlike the lip liners from kkw beauty\u00a0\u00a0\nbefore she discontinued them this one is in the\u00a0\nParisian Chic it's a stay in line lip pencil\nthat's a really nice formula creamy but not overly\u00a0\ncreamy is this going to be one of those underrated\u00a0\u00a0\nbrands that like have really good products but\u00a0\nnobody talks about them I cannot wait to get to\u00a0\u00a0\nthe eyeshadows I feel like that's going to be\u00a0\nthe break Make It or Break It moment okay so I\u00a0\u00a0\nwill say this lip liner is like my skin color\u00a0\nso I have a light medium skin tone if you are\u00a0\u00a0\na fair to light and you're looking for a Light\u00a0\nBeige lip liner that's not too dark I think this\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor would be perfect for you but if you're my\u00a0\nskin color or darker just know that this color\u00a0\u00a0\nit is very light am I gonna do let us Swatch and\u00a0\nsee which one I want to use so this is the one\nthat's the lip cream and then we have\u00a0\nthe lipstick here oh I do like that color\u00a0\u00a0\nI think I'm gonna do this lipstick\nthat is a comfort mat uh oh what I mean with\u00a0\nthat is that it feels creamy but looks matte\u00a0\u00a0\nso it probably has some silicones\u00a0\nin it some comfort matte lipsticks\u00a0\u00a0\nwith silicones are an amazing formula\u00a0\nand looks and feels amazing some do\u00a0\u00a0\nnot I'll put this on and we'll see at the\u00a0\nend of the video if it's acting up or not\u00a0\u00a0\nbut it goes on really beautifully okay let's\u00a0\ndive in to the eyeshadow palettes the one that\u00a0\u00a0\nimmediately grabbed my attention is this pastel\u00a0\npalette it it's just honestly the most intriguing\u00a0\u00a0\npalette I mean the maths are nothing to write home\u00a0\nabout it's just three light mats one is a pastel\u00a0\u00a0\npink the other two are just beiges but these six\u00a0\npastel shimmers look really incredible in the pan\u00a0\u00a0\nand I can't wait to use them on the eyes honestly\u00a0\nthey look so cute and I also was very intrigued by\u00a0\u00a0\nthis all matte palette because I I saw this one\u00a0\nwhile I was still waiting for my Huda all matte\u00a0\u00a0\npalette and I was thinking if you were in the\u00a0\nmarket for all matte palette maybe this could\u00a0\u00a0\nbe an alternative if it's good quality because\u00a0\nit goes from really light to really dark it does\u00a0\u00a0\nhave a little like there's like a mint blue a pink\u00a0\nsome Grays this dark blue like there's something\u00a0\u00a0\na little different about this and then I\u00a0\nhad to get this quad because look at this\nhave you ever seen anything this unusual to\u00a0\nthe drugstore it is an all matte all colorful\u00a0\u00a0\nquad and I saw this and I was like am I like\u00a0\nin another dimension like what year is this\u00a0\u00a0\nI am so intrigued by this and if this is even\u00a0\nsomewhat decent quality this would be such an\u00a0\u00a0\neasy and affordable way to add some colors to your\u00a0\ncollection so I kinda oh my God what am I doing\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna use all of three of these am I making\u00a0\nthis oh I also have this one this is a glimmer\u00a0\u00a0\nShadow we'll try a little bit of this at the end\u00a0\nthis is the celestial lust eyeshadow and I have\u00a0\u00a0\nmine in Songbird it's like a iridescent gold pink\u00a0\nduochrome it looks beautiful okay so I want to do\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething with the uh blue that's why I'm having\u00a0\nthis I love this shirt it's so beautiful I want to\u00a0\u00a0\ndo something oh my god with these two Shadows\u00a0\nhere the mint and the blue they look amazing\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe this one too oh my God they look so cute\u00a0\u00a0\nand something with that Celestial\u00a0\nshade probably on the low lash line\nI think I'm gonna do the green let's do the\u00a0\ngreen and see how that is on the lower lash\u00a0\u00a0\nline I feel like I didn't don't have\u00a0\nany primer on my lower lash line I did\u00a0\u00a0\na powder so I'm not 100 sure how this is\u00a0\ngonna turn out we're getting some pigment\u00a0\u00a0\nwe're getting some pigment I of course I'm gonna\u00a0\nhave to try this out quite a lot more I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nuse this purple as well in the upper part of my\u00a0\ncrease oh this is definitely not as pigmented as\u00a0\u00a0\nthe green was straight out of the gate yeah that's\u00a0\ndefinitely a little bit more on the weak side\njust using a little bit of this up here\ndefinitely not a super pigmented\u00a0\nshade the green seemed a lot better\u00a0\u00a0\nnothing to write home about but something I really\u00a0\nwant to try these two shades here so I'm gonna do\u00a0\u00a0\nthis dark blue in my outer corner that is\u00a0\ngiving more pigment than the purple did\nnot intensely pigmented but\u00a0\ndefinitely doable mm-hmm\nI would say that this is doable but definitely\u00a0\nin the like drugstore category of quality so\u00a0\u00a0\nlet's see how this like lighter\u00a0\nmint is if we can use that here\nyeah definitely a little on the weaker side it's a\u00a0\nshame I had so much like hope for this to be like\u00a0\u00a0\nI was hoping for like one of those BH Cosmetics\u00a0\nmoments but maybe the shimmers will save it\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause the mats are okay but nothing more I think\u00a0\nI'm done with the mats and just initial impression\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're okay but nothing more but let's dive in\u00a0\nto the shimmers I'm gonna start actually with this\u00a0\u00a0\none because it's gonna match so well with this out\u00a0\nhere and I am going to be a think spraying these\u00a0\u00a0\npicked up pretty good but I think it's a\u00a0\nlittle bit more on the drier side so I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna be spraying it to give it a little bit\u00a0\nmore Pizzazz and I don't want a lot of Fallout\u00a0\u00a0\nand since I am using oh that's pretty since\u00a0\nI'm using several different shades it's gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nbe a lot easier for me to use a brush and be a\u00a0\nlittle detailed no that's actually pretty good\u00a0\u00a0\nokay yeah so far I like the\u00a0\nShimmer more than I like the matte\u00a0\u00a0\nso maybe this like pastel palette actually\u00a0\ncould be something so this is the light\u00a0\u00a0\nblue iridescent and I think I'm gonna put\u00a0\nthat on the rest of the lid oh kind of cute\nokay\nand I'll do the green here and then we'll do\u00a0\nthat liquid shadow in the inner corner what do we\u00a0\u00a0\nthink about that and since the mats were a little\u00a0\nweak I'll just blend this Shimmer up a little bit\nthat actually looks good and also something\u00a0\nthat I always do is that I go in again with\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shadow like the dark shadow and\u00a0\nI will reapply in the outer corner\u00a0\u00a0\nabove the Shimmer to make sure that I'm not\u00a0\nlosing the intensity and that my absolute\u00a0\u00a0\nouter corner is still matte because\u00a0\non me I think that that works better\u00a0\u00a0\nso I always go back and reapply the dark matte\u00a0\nafter the Shimmer okay let's do the green as\u00a0\u00a0\nwell and just finish this this one up this eye so\u00a0\nwe can do the liquid Shadow so let's do that here\nyou know what I cannot I cannot prove but this\u00a0\nlike pastel palette with the shimmers I mean the\u00a0\u00a0\nmattes are probably going to be a little mediocre\u00a0\nbut those shimmers are cute I don't know if this\u00a0\u00a0\nbrand has any eye pens but I don't have any eye\u00a0\npens from this brand at least so I'm using this\u00a0\u00a0\none from La girl in my waterline I'll link it\u00a0\ndown below as well it's actually a really good\u00a0\u00a0\nlike minty turquoise you want if you if you're\u00a0\nlooking for a color like this one and it's also\u00a0\u00a0\nuh from the drugstore so I will leave that down\u00a0\nbelow I also did use this mascara I will be using\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one in an upcoming video that hasn't come\u00a0\nyet to my channel that's a little pre-filmed and\u00a0\u00a0\nI did say in that video this is the Maybelline\u00a0\nThe falsi Surreal mascara that I wasn't overly\u00a0\u00a0\nimpressed with it but I will say I have used\u00a0\nthis this is probably the fourth or the fifth\u00a0\u00a0\ntime that I'm wearing it today and with time I've\u00a0\nactually come to like you can see my lashes today\u00a0\u00a0\nI've actually come to really enjoy this one\u00a0\nI still think I like this Sky High more than\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one but I do think that it is a really nice\u00a0\nmascara and it definitely does like elongate and\u00a0\u00a0\nseparate the lashes in a really nice way and\u00a0\nI think it is a really nice mascara so just\u00a0\u00a0\nletting you know that when you hear me talk about\u00a0\nthis in the future just know that I've slightly\u00a0\u00a0\nchanged my mind and I think I said then I thought\u00a0\nit was okay now I definitely think it is like\u00a0\u00a0\nit's good it's not amazing but it's definitely\u00a0\ngood let's try this liquid eyeshadow I haven't\u00a0\u00a0\noh done anything with this but like should\u00a0\nwe just try a little bit in the inner corner\nthat's I I think oh yeah you can see the glimmer\u00a0\nthat I was gonna say I think I see it more than\u00a0\u00a0\nyou do no but no it really does be catching the\u00a0\nlight so let's just put a little bit and just\u00a0\u00a0\nlet this be like a little catching the light in\u00a0\nthe inner corner I actually really like how this\u00a0\u00a0\neye look came out especially with the mint in\u00a0\nthe inner corner and those iridescent Shadows\u00a0\u00a0\nand then with this little glimmer here I\u00a0\nI kind of do like it I mean again the mats\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're okay at best but I really think that\u00a0\nthese shimmers are really nice are they like in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Indie makeup amazing quality no but they're\u00a0\ndefinitely really nice pastels at the drugstore\u00a0\u00a0\nand if you were looking for some pastels and you\u00a0\nwere more into iridescent shimmers than you are\u00a0\u00a0\njust I don't know mattes then I think that this\u00a0\ncould be a nice one I think they're pretty like\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can see some of them are a little bit more\u00a0\nsparkly some of them are a little bit more subdued\u00a0\u00a0\nlike uh Shimmer but honestly I think this palette\u00a0\nis nice is it amazing no I wouldn't say that it's\u00a0\u00a0\namazing but it's definitely a nice palette and\u00a0\nif you were wanting to shop like a drugstore\u00a0\u00a0\nyou didn't want to order from India Brands and you\u00a0\nwanted to have something pastel I definitely think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat this one is the winner at least out of these\u00a0\nthree palettes even though I don't think that it's\u00a0\u00a0\nlike amazing but yeah I'm gonna put on some half\u00a0\nlashes because I love that but at least you get to\u00a0\u00a0\nsee how the look is before I do that but I think\u00a0\nthat is it I've tried all the products let's have\u00a0\u00a0\na chat so we have finally arrived I don't I went\u00a0\non a detour just reading mails and like I found\u00a0\u00a0\nit an energy drink and it's it's been a while it's\u00a0\nbeen a while before I wanted to let you know first\u00a0\u00a0\nabout the lips before I forget it is definitely\u00a0\nnot a full mat it feels like a cream on the lips\u00a0\u00a0\nI would say like it's a velvet mat with a\u00a0\nslight not Sheen it's like less than a satin but\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely not fully matte still very comfortable\u00a0\nhas not like started to misbehave crack separate\u00a0\u00a0\nstart to make lines not even the line like here\u00a0\nit hasn't done that either it's not transfer proof\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I really like the lipstick I think it's a\u00a0\nnice one and off the eyeshadow palette like I\u00a0\u00a0\nsaid my favorite is this one that has the Shimmer\u00a0\nthe pastel shimmers in it I do think this is good\u00a0\u00a0\nthe matte formula is a low like as you can see I\u00a0\nwas able to do something it's definitely workable\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I have other formulas that I prefer the liquid\u00a0\nShadow really nice I think the cheek products are\u00a0\u00a0\nreally beautiful and I do like the foundation that\u00a0\nI have here somewhere hello this one I like this\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom before I definitely recommend it if you\u00a0\nwanted to have something that's like a glowy\u00a0\u00a0\nbut not dewy or sticky medium coverage Foundation\u00a0\nfrom the drugstore I think all the products were\u00a0\u00a0\nreally good but I think the main store of the\u00a0\nshow definitely is this highlighter product I\u00a0\u00a0\nvery much approve of how that looks if you\u00a0\nwere looking for that wet glow that the new\u00a0\u00a0\nrare Beauty highlighters and the new Charlotte\u00a0\nTilbury highlighters are giving but at a very\u00a0\u00a0\nmuch lower cost definitely definitely try\u00a0\nthis one out it's not a dupe but it is so\u00a0\u00a0\nsimilar that if you wear this and someone asks me\u00a0\nwhat it is and I say that it's the new Charlotte\u00a0\u00a0\nTilbury nobody would question me not a single\u00a0\nsoul would question me and you get three full\u00a0\u00a0\nsize I think these are like full size because\u00a0\nthere's a lot of product in here yeah this is\u00a0\u00a0\n15 gram of products so 5 gram 5 gram 5 gram for\u00a0\nless than one highlighter of the high end cost so\u00a0\u00a0\nI would say that that is definitely the winner\u00a0\nof the show I will like I said link everything\u00a0\u00a0\ndown below please let me know if you have tried\u00a0\nthis brand I would love to hear your thoughts\u00a0\u00a0\nand yeah hope you're having an amazing day and I\u00a0\nwill see you real soon again for a new video bye\n[Music] [Applause] [Music]",

So if you picked a too intense color like wicked apple, you can put it on your finger and dab over your lips and it will look super natural but more flustered. 10/10 product",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

find a brow\u00a0\nbrush i'm gonna walk you through my brows i guess\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's the first thing i like to do i don't know\u00a0\nwhy i just like to have my brows done so i'm using\u00a0\u00a0\nthe anastasia beverly hills brow product this\u00a0\nis the dip brow pomade in the shade dark brown\nsee the difference already this is very fast for\u00a0\nme so first thing i'm gonna go into this w7 24k\u00a0\u00a0\nprimer and this is kind of like an oil\u00a0\nprimer it's a very thick consistency so\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm just gonna add a little bit and this makes\u00a0\nyour foundation just a little bit more that\u00a0\u00a0\nglowy it has absolutely no smell it's\u00a0\njust so very hydrating into your skin\u00a0\u00a0\nunderneath i do have spf and on top i'm\u00a0\ngoing to use the milani soft glow focus\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is in the shade nude glow just a\u00a0\ntiny bit like on the high points here\nkind of push everything in i really want to\u00a0\nget the rare beauty concealer brush as well\u00a0\u00a0\ni just love their unique shape i'm going to be\u00a0\nusing one of my favorite foundations this is more\u00a0\u00a0\nof a high-end foundation this is the los angeles\u00a0\ngarland foundation and mine is in the shade\u00a0\u00a0\noh oh w so beautiful it's glass it comes\u00a0\nwith a pump so i'm just gonna pump one pump\u00a0\u00a0\nout because it's very very pigmented so that's all\u00a0\ni'm using for now anyways and see so i'll be using\u00a0\u00a0\nmy moda complexion brush i love how colorful they\u00a0\nare i placed an order of more brushes from mora\nnow look how beautiful this foundation looks so\u00a0\nnice now let me switch to this brush around the\u00a0\u00a0\neyebrows here i'm gonna go into my morphe sponge\u00a0\nand dab everything in and you see how beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nthe coverage is on this foundation looks very\u00a0\nglowy yet it's still gives you more coverage than\u00a0\u00a0\nother foundations i just love it and the design\u00a0\nof the bottle is just so adorable so next let's\u00a0\u00a0\ngo into concealer so i'm gonna use the rare beauty\u00a0\nconcealer and mine is in the shade 170 w so pretty\nso i'll be putting a little bit on the\u00a0\nouter corner of course inner corner here\u00a0\u00a0\nand on the eyelids to prime the eyelids so\u00a0\ni'm gonna use the sponge for now i'm in the\u00a0\u00a0\nbrush for now now let it sit a bit and dry up\u00a0\nbefore i put powder because i've noticed if you\u00a0\u00a0\nput powder right away and it's still a little\u00a0\nbit wet from your sponge and from the concealer\u00a0\u00a0\nit actually cakes up mostly in here if you put\u00a0\npowder to set it so next i'm going to go into\u00a0\u00a0\nbronzing while the eyelids settle and i'm going to\u00a0\nuse the essence sun club matte bronzer mine is in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shade all natural and it smells so nice too so\u00a0\nfor this one i'm gonna use my moda brush this is\u00a0\u00a0\na powder brush but i'll use it kind of brown\u00a0\nbronze i love this bronzer so much and it's such a\u00a0\u00a0\ngood price too it is very inexpensive like it\u00a0\nperforms even better than some expensive ones\u00a0\u00a0\ni've used the fenty beauty one the powder one\u00a0\nand it looks like that one you just have to like\u00a0\u00a0\ndig in so much to get to this point that i'm\u00a0\nalready at so i love this bronzer so talking about\u00a0\u00a0\nbronzers make sure you comment down below and let\u00a0\nme know what is your favorite drugstore bronzer\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe

which i\u00a0\nwould love to have in my collection but this is in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shade dreamy 73 very beautiful very very very\u00a0\npigmented so be very careful i'll show you what it\u00a0\u00a0\ni mean by it it's very pigmented look at that\u00a0\nso i'm just gonna put a little bit on the back\u00a0\u00a0\nof my hand just a very tiny bit and use my pinky\u00a0\nand apply it three dots like that and then just\u00a0\u00a0\nvery gently go with my real techniques\u00a0\nbrush you can see how pigmented that is look\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm using this um 402 brush let's do\u00a0\nthe same thing on this uh on this cheek\u00a0\u00a0\nso this blush reminds me of the rare beauty you\u00a0\nsee how pigmented this is oh let's put some on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe nose as well and if you end up thinking that\u00a0\nyou did go too much feel free to kind of take your\u00a0\u00a0\nsponge and press on it and just melt into the\u00a0\nskin okay perfect and look how much i still

moving my table\u00a0\u00a0\nso now i'm gonna go into this essence nude\u00a0\nhighlighter and mine is in the shade 10\u00a0\u00a0\nbe my highlight and let's use the\u00a0\nthis is my favorite brush to use\u00a0\u00a0\nthe moda pro brush so i'm going to dip into\u00a0\nthis highlighter and highlight this area here\nso just apply it and then use circular motions\u00a0\nvery pretty i'm gonna go into this charlotte\u00a0\u00a0\ntilbury powder and this is in the shade one\u00a0\nfair it's the airbrush flawless filter this\u00a0\u00a0\none right here so i'm gonna use this moda brush\u00a0\nand just kind of go underneath here a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nand then i'm gonna set the eyes with it as well\nwe're gonna start with the eye shadow palette so\u00a0\nfor the eyeshadow palette we have this beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\ncolors right here and i really want to do\u00a0\nsomething with this yellow today let's start\u00a0\u00a0\nwith this peach pink shade right\u00a0\nhere which is the lightest one\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm gonna use this as my transition\u00a0\ncolor so put it just above the crease\nokay so next i'm gonna go into a this\u00a0\none right here and add it to the crease\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm gonna use this moda brush this is a\u00a0\ncrease brush which is another fluffy brush\u00a0\u00a0\nand go into that shade and put it inside\u00a0\nthe crease to make this area a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\none shade darker than what we've used above\nso take your time at blending just use very\u00a0\nlight pressure very pretty and now i'm gonna go\u00a0\u00a0\ninto the darker one here which is this one right\u00a0\nthere and use this angled blender brush by moda\u00a0\u00a0\nand kind of put it in the outer corner\u00a0\nhere just a tiny bit i don't want to go\u00a0\u00a0\ntoo too dark because we're going to\u00a0\nput the yellow all over the eyelid\u00a0\u00a0\nthe same thing on this eye and\u00a0\nthen we're going to blend them\nokay so now we're gonna get our blending brush\u00a0\nand blend this into the crease and outwards\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm doing this nice yellow sunny look\u00a0\nbecause of spring and summer coming but\u00a0\u00a0\nin the month of april here in alberta it has\u00a0\ndecided to snow so i'm gonna insert a clip\u00a0\u00a0\nso you guys can see what it looks like outside\u00a0\nright now look guys what's outside here in alberta\u00a0\u00a0\nsnow in april lots and lots of snow crazy okay\u00a0\nso so far everything looks nice and blended so\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm gonna go in with my finger now and go\u00a0\ninto this beautiful yellow shade let's see\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so let's add this over the eyelid so\u00a0\nwith this one i've noticed a little bit of\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit of fallout so maybe it's best applied\u00a0\nwith a wet brush so let's try that oh still looks\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful so let me get a brush i'm going to get\u00a0\nthis cold beauty brush and i'm going to spray it\u00a0\u00a0\nwith some setting spray which is\u00a0\nthe urban decay all nighter spray\nand dip into this yellow and\u00a0\nmaybe we'll so much at the top\nlet's see if this makes a difference oh\u00a0\nyeah it makes it more like foil on your eye\nit makes it stick that is beautiful this is the\u00a0\nsame thing on this eye so definitely this shade\u00a0\u00a0\nis best used with a wet brush that way you're\u00a0\nnot gonna have fallout because the glitters\u00a0\u00a0\nwill stick to your eyelid and now let's do\u00a0\nthe bottom the bottom lash line and for the\u00a0\u00a0\nbottom lash line i'm going to use this moda brush\u00a0\nit's like a smudger brush and go into that dark\u00a0\u00a0\nshade which is the darkest one the brown smudge\u00a0\nit underneath here i'm gonna blend it all out\ni think it turned out very pretty now for the\u00a0\ninner corner i don't know what i'm gonna use\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me see this i think for the inner corner i'm\u00a0\ngonna go with this beautiful peach one right here\u00a0\u00a0\ni was gonna go with this one here but it's more\u00a0\nglittery so i'll be using a this is my favorite\u00a0\u00a0\nbrush to use for the inner corner this is a morphe\u00a0\nbrush this is one of their blinked brushes and\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me spray this to intensify that inner corner a\u00a0\nbit more so i'm going to dip into that light shade\nit's like a nice peachy color so it's a little\u00a0\nbit more darker but it looks really nice with the\u00a0\u00a0\nlook very pretty i love it and now for\u00a0\nthe underneath the brow bone i'm gonna use\u00a0\u00a0\nmy highlighter my essence highlighter\u00a0\nand highlight this area a bit more\nnow i'm gonna go into my first brush with\u00a0\nthat first peach color that we used and i\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to bring that peach a little bit\u00a0\nhigher here because it kind of got lost\nwe want to have a nice transition from light\u00a0\nto light peach to darker to the brown and\u00a0\u00a0\nto the yellow very nice now i want to complete\u00a0\nthis look with a black liner and i'm gonna use\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is the l'oreal infallible gel liner this is\u00a0\nlike looks like this inside i'm going to use this\u00a0\u00a0\nmoda angled brush looks like this and i will apply\u00a0\nthis at the top right here so i'm just gonna stick\u00a0\u00a0\nblack line now for the inner corner i want to\u00a0\nuse this brush by elf and this is the angled\u00a0\u00a0\neyeliner brush this is what it\u00a0\nlooks like so needle like looking\u00a0\u00a0\nand you want to use this for the inner corner here\nit's easier to get in the inner corner with such a\u00a0\nsmall brush let's do the same thing on this eye so\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's the eyeliner i think it looks so beautiful\u00a0\ni definitely recommend this this is one of my\u00a0\u00a0\nfavorite eyeliners to use this is the l'oreal one\u00a0\nand i also have a maybelline one in black so they\u00a0\u00a0\nare just so pretty so for the underneath here\u00a0\nlike in the waterline i want to use i have two\u00a0\u00a0\nyellows by colourpop i have this regular yellow\u00a0\nlike a darker orange yellow and then i have this\u00a0\u00a0\nvivid color yellow so i don't know what i want\u00a0\nto use let me try it here see which one would go\u00a0\u00a0\nbest with this eye look oh here they are this\u00a0\nis the vivid one and this is the regular one\u00a0\u00a0\nlet's go with the vivid one right why not\u00a0\nlet's try the vivid one and use this in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe waterline here just for an extra pop of\u00a0\ncolor oh i love it okay so this eyeliners\u00a0\u00a0\ni have a review on my channel i believe the\u00a0\nvideo is probably going to be before this one so\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm obsessed with this eyeliners\u00a0\nby colourpop i have them all here\u00a0\u00a0\nright here including some by nyx they're inside\u00a0\nhere and i just love them like just gives the\u00a0\u00a0\nwhole look it brings it to another level\u00a0\nanyway so now i'm gonna do the boring part\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich is going to be applying mascara this is\u00a0\none of my favorite mascaras the wet and wild\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom the drugstore i will apply it enjoy\u00a0\nthis intermission and i'll be right back\nhope you enjoyed the intermission and here is the\u00a0\nlook with the mascara on i think you know how much\u00a0\u00a0\ni raved about this mascara it is my favorite i\u00a0\ndefinitely recommend it it will luminize it it\u00a0\u00a0\nlengthens it just i don't know\u00a0\nbest mascara ever for me anyways\u00a0\u00a0\nso that's applied now let's\u00a0\ngo ahead and do the lips\u00a0\u00a0\nfor the lips i have of course colourpop\u00a0\nlip liner i want to use this nice nude lip\u00a0\u00a0\nliner this is in the shade bff i think that's\u00a0\none of my favorite lip liners from colourpop\nokay so the lips are blind and i\u00a0\nfilled them in a tiny bit with this\u00a0\u00a0\nand i wanna use this a beautiful lipstick\u00a0\nit's called it's by l'oreal it looks like this\u00a0\u00a0\nokay and it's in the shade 107 coconut\u00a0\nplum i'll show what it looks like\nright here it's such a beautiful nude shade it's\u00a0\nnot a matte lipstick i'm gonna go ahead and apply\u00a0\u00a0\nit and show it to you guys it's such a beautiful\u00a0\nnude lip plump basically plumps your lips it's\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of like a lipstick very nice and creamy\u00a0\nwhere is my liner where's my lip liner here is\ni think that this lip color goes really good\u00a0\nwith the eye look then it makes the eyes really\u00a0\u00a0\npop because it brings the attention to the eyes\u00a0\nand not the lips i think it looks very beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nanyways this is pretty much the final look now my\u00a0\nthoughts on this palette i love this palette the\u00a0\u00a0\nmatte some the mattes that i've used are very\u00a0\nvery easy to blend there's no fallout they're\u00a0\u00a0\nvery pigmented as you can see get enough pigment\u00a0\nfor a beautiful eye look now the this one right\u00a0\u00a0\nhere the yellow that i've used and i'm assuming\u00a0\nthe one beside it as well are good shades to use\u00a0\u00a0\nwith a wet brush because then the eyeshadow sticks\u00a0\nto the eyelid a bit better than when using your\u00a0\u00a0\nfinger and it gives it that extra more pigment\u00a0\nas well and the inner corner shade i've used\u00a0\u00a0\nit's very beautiful to be used with a wet brush\u00a0\nor with your finger or a dry brush to use for\u00a0\u00a0\nthe inner corner as you can see there are a little\u00a0\nbit of fallout definitely a beautiful palette that\u00a0\u00a0\ni've received in my boxycharm box and i love\u00a0\nit so this is the final look i hope you guys\u00a0\u00a0\nreally enjoyed it and if you did please consider\u00a0\nsubscribing and give this video a big thumbs up if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou liked it it would mean the world to me and i\u00a0\nwill see you in my next one love you guys bye you",

So if you picked a too intense color like wicked apple, you can put it on your finger and dab over your lips and it will look super natural but more flustered. 10/10 product",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

        "transcript_text": "hello everyone welcome back to my\u00a0\nchannel and welcome to this video\u00a0\u00a0\nwe are going to talk about this palette\u00a0\nthis is the Italian Spritz by Too Faced\u00a0\u00a0\nis this the first Too Faced palette I've\u00a0\never bought it actually might be but I was\u00a0\u00a0\nvery intrigued by this one so we are going\u00a0\nto be trying it out I'm gonna be swatching\u00a0\u00a0\nit I'm gonna be doing two different looks\u00a0\nshowing you what kind of Versatility you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan get with this palette and if you haven't\u00a0\nbeen here before do consider subscribing but\u00a0\u00a0\nalso know that I am a big lover of color which\u00a0\nyou might already see so I will definitely try\u00a0\u00a0\nand make this palette as bold and as colorful\u00a0\nand fun as possible because that's just my jam\n[Music]\u00a0\u00a0\npalette at Ulta and I got I bought\u00a0\nit on Sunday morning and I got it at\u00a0\u00a0\nTuesday lunch and I'm filming this on Wednesday\u00a0\nmorning so I will say I think that they went on\u00a0\u00a0\npretty quickly with this one it is in the tin\u00a0\npackaging and it is called the Italian Spritz\u00a0\u00a0\npalette and if you've been here for a bit you\u00a0\nknow that in Italian splits which is an aperol\u00a0\u00a0\nSpritz is one of my absolute favorite drinks ever\u00a0\nit is right up there together with a Cucumber\u00a0\u00a0\nmartini I love a Cucumber martini I think it is\u00a0\nabsolutely amazing anything cucumbery listen I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ndown cucumber Tom Collins listen all of it I am\u00a0\ndown but I love it Italian Spritz and especially\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen in Italy and also my husband is half Italian\u00a0\nso I think it's just really fun that this is I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink this is the first Too Faced palette I ever\u00a0\nbought I bought it for 54. and at first I was like\u00a0\u00a0\noh that's a little expensive but I actually\u00a0\nlooked and I think their last couple of pack\u00a0\u00a0\nlike tallest or in tin packaging like this have\u00a0\nalso been 54. so it seems to be the price they're\u00a0\u00a0\ncharging for this kind of palette I will say the\u00a0\npackaging is beautiful everything looks beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nand it smells very sweet but still a hint of\u00a0\ncitrus but just it smells very sweet and usually\u00a0\u00a0\na lot of Too Faced palettes and makeup is sent\u00a0\nthat I don't mind that but I know some people will\u00a0\u00a0\nbut when I'm over here I can't smell it I like\u00a0\nreally have to get in there to smell it so it's\u00a0\u00a0\nnot like it's overwhelming by any stretch of the\u00a0\nimagination I will say from just looking at this\u00a0\u00a0\npalette it seems to be mattes and metallics\u00a0\nand then we have two shades here there is a\u00a0\u00a0\nthird formula and I haven't swatched this you've\u00a0\nalready seen the swatches but I haven't swatched\u00a0\u00a0\nthis but maybe you noticed in these swatches that\u00a0\nthese two are a little bit different they are a\u00a0\u00a0\npoured formula I can see that this formula these\u00a0\nare pressed but this is a poured formula so it's\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to be really interesting to see how those\u00a0\nbehave on the eyes we're definitely going to be\u00a0\u00a0\nusing this blue because I love me a good blue but\u00a0\nyeah let's dive in I will link this palette and\u00a0\u00a0\nI will link everything that I have on my face I\u00a0\nthink both this top and these earrings I brought\u00a0\u00a0\nout something really summery they're old usually\u00a0\nlike I buy clothes and then I wear them for years\u00a0\u00a0\nand years and years until they break so usually\u00a0\nif I can link stuff it's always in the description\u00a0\u00a0\nbox but sometimes things are just a little old\u00a0\nand I'm not able to link them but let's jump in\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause honestly I'm very excited is this like\u00a0\nthe two-faced comeback that nobody was expecting\u00a0\u00a0\nbefore we get into the eyeshadow I bought this\u00a0\none as well the order from uh Opa I bought\u00a0\u00a0\nthree things I bought my favorite powder from NYX\u00a0\nbecause I'm almost out I will actually link that\u00a0\u00a0\none down below in case you're interested and then\u00a0\nI bought the palette can I also say the packaging\u00a0\u00a0\nis super beautiful too if you're the kind of\u00a0\nperson who likes to keep the packaging and I\u00a0\u00a0\nbought the new Stila calligraphy lip stain because\u00a0\nthey had an orange so I thought we used that one\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm actually using one of my absolute favorite lip\u00a0\nliners which is from Too Faced so this is the Too\u00a0\u00a0\nFaced lady bold lip liner in badass I've actually\u00a0\ngone through one of these this is my second one\u00a0\u00a0\nso I thought we used a little bit look at this at\u00a0\nleast a little bit of this in the middle because\u00a0\u00a0\nI love that like reversed ombre that looks like\u00a0\na popsicle lip oh doesn't smell like anything\nthat's super pretty and I'm just gonna\u00a0\nagain with the lip liner this is one of\u00a0\u00a0\nthose that you click up I'm just\u00a0\ngonna fix the edge a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nand then I'm gonna go over with the hangover\u00a0\nuh pillow bomb this one is in the cocoa one\njust for a little shine\nthat is a beautiful nude with a Twist I love that\u00a0\nokay big fan so far I will of course review these\u00a0\u00a0\nthings once I've used them a little bit more\u00a0\nbut initial impression big fan of that one a big\u00a0\u00a0\nfan of the color it came in a bunch of different\u00a0\ncolors as well okay eye primer is on and I think\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna start with this in the bottom that's\u00a0\ncalled Capri fun which is like a really bright\u00a0\u00a0\nlike orange yellow so I think I'm gonna do there\u00a0\nis a lot of kick up in the pan so go in a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit more easy than I did don't do what I did kids\u00a0\nbut I'm gonna do one look that's more on a warmer\u00a0\u00a0\npinky orange she something thingamajing and then\u00a0\nI'm gonna do one look with the more berries maybe\u00a0\u00a0\nI'll use the pink there I'll do the next look I'll\u00a0\ndo the pink the berry and like the blue over here\nright maybe even the Black Metallic here and then\u00a0\nI'll do this one with this one the one that's\u00a0\u00a0\ncalled ciao Bellini which is like that peach it\u00a0\nseems like a dual Chrome a peach called duochrome\u00a0\u00a0\nshould we do that and then I can use the\u00a0\nEspresso Yourself to deepen this one up\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'll do a little bit more of a\u00a0\nlook there is some Fallout here I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink I put too much on my brush rookie\u00a0\nmistake yeah I'll do this one and then\u00a0\u00a0\nthe espresso yourself and I'll try\u00a0\nand show you how you can brighten up\u00a0\u00a0\na neutral look if you want to use a brown\u00a0\nand then we'll do the pink and the berry I\u00a0\u00a0\nwill say I'm very impressed with how pigmented\u00a0\nthis one is very pigmented very easy to blend\nthat is a beautiful color very\u00a0\nmuch a fan of that color I think\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna use the exact same\u00a0\ncolor under my eyes as well\nI actually really like this you know I\u00a0\nlove a orange that's like a little yellowy\u00a0\u00a0\nthe only downfall I would see so far is that this\u00a0\ncolor picks up a lot and it's easy to get Fallout\u00a0\u00a0\nand it's easy to get it to be messy in the pan so\u00a0\njust keep that in mind that this is definitely one\u00a0\u00a0\nof those that gets a little bit messy is that\u00a0\none of my hairs holy so this is the espresso\u00a0\u00a0\nyourself and listen I could definitely go for an\u00a0\nespresso ride now I could go for a trip to Capri\u00a0\u00a0\nas well I haven't been to Capri but I have been\u00a0\nto the two islands that are next to Capri which\u00a0\u00a0\nis like the budget version of like they're so\u00a0\nclose to each other you can literally go on a\u00a0\u00a0\nDay Tour on a boat to Capri or to like any of\u00a0\nthe other Islands they're outside of Napoli so\u00a0\u00a0\nI've been to iskia and I've been to puroshira\u00a0\nand they are both like next to Capri really\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful me and Ricardo went there actually for\u00a0\nour honeymoon just before we moved here to the US\u00a0\u00a0\nand I I mean I love Italy uh I do love Italia my\u00a0\nhusband speaks in Italian he speaks fluid Italian\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know much like I do know what all of the\u00a0\nthings in this palette like all of these things I\u00a0\u00a0\nknow what they mean but I don't speak Italian\u00a0\nunfortunately I would love to one day and I\u00a0\u00a0\nknow some people are talking about those like\u00a0\napps where you can learn a language like like\u00a0\u00a0\nBabel like is that good have you tried it is it\u00a0\nany good I would I like it that looks beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nthat looks absolutely beautiful I'm just putting\u00a0\na little bit more of the orange on the edge\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's that's actually stunning is it super dark\u00a0\nno but it is beautifully stunning so this is the\u00a0\u00a0\nshade ciao Bellini and I will say it picks up\u00a0\na little chunky not gritty but it definitely\u00a0\u00a0\ndoesn't feel smooth I'm not going to use that one\u00a0\nbecause I'm out of that one I'm gonna use some Fix\u00a0\u00a0\nPlus just some traditional Mac Fix Plus because I\u00a0\nthink that this one will need it just based on how\u00a0\u00a0\nit felt when I picked it up yeah because it feels\u00a0\nthat's pretty it looks a little bit more gold than\u00a0\u00a0\nPeach on the lid but that could also be that I'm\u00a0\nmatching it with an orange but yeah it definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nfeels like a shade that needs a little bit of\u00a0\na damp brush in order from not to just crumble\u00a0\u00a0\nand fall under your eyes and nobody needs or\u00a0\nwants Fallout like we want the Shadows to be\u00a0\u00a0\non our Lids not under your eyes and\u00a0\nI'm not doing a cut crease I'm just\u00a0\u00a0\nputting it on and blending it out and it\u00a0\nis looking like a peachy gold on my eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nbut yeah I definitely see at least I see a\u00a0\nlittle of the pink peach duochrome in real life\u00a0\u00a0\nit's a very pretty shade but it's definitely more\u00a0\nof a warm peachy gold than it is a straight up\u00a0\u00a0\nduochrome on my eyes I see a little bit duochrome\u00a0\naction but it's not it's not like an intense to\u00a0\u00a0\nChrome by any stretch of the imagination I love a\u00a0\nmatte inner corner I think it's super flattering\u00a0\u00a0\nand eye-opening and just beautiful and if you\u00a0\nhaven't tried it this is your reminder your\u00a0\u00a0\ndaily reminder to try a matte inner corner I'm\u00a0\ngoing to be using this one that's gelat oh I'd\u00a0\u00a0\nlove myself some gelato I actually found a place\u00a0\nhere in Austin that we ate from it's on South\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's beautiful that's on South Congress and\u00a0\nboth me and Ricardo agree that this is really\u00a0\u00a0\nnice gelato it was very high quality you can\u00a0\nalways tell how good someone's gelato is by\u00a0\u00a0\ntheir pistachio gelato or pistachio as Ricardo\u00a0\nalways corrects me because that is the Italian\u00a0\u00a0\nuh because then you know whether or\u00a0\nnot they skimped on the ingredients\u00a0\u00a0\nbut their pistachio gelato was amazing and I\u00a0\nreally really did enjoy it and this looks so\nthat is a beautiful cream like a bright cream like\u00a0\nnot like bright stark white but it's like a heavy\u00a0\u00a0\ncream super pigmented and very beautiful\u00a0\nI will say the Shimmer is stunning and I\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely think it's beautiful on the lid but\u00a0\nthe star of the show so far are definitely the\u00a0\u00a0\nmattes needless to say I am very much in love\u00a0\nwith this look this is how I like to do like a\u00a0\u00a0\nneutral palette because there is a neutral like\u00a0\nGoldy Peach on the lid and there is a brown in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe outer corner but then there is this bright\u00a0\nbright yellowy orange they're just bringing this\u00a0\u00a0\ninto a bright summer mango kind of a feeling and\u00a0\nI'm all about it and like I said before so far\u00a0\u00a0\nthe star of the show are definitely the mattes\u00a0\nI am very impressed with the mats especially the\u00a0\u00a0\norange and that like matte inner Corner they\u00a0\nhave been behaving absolutely beautiful the\u00a0\u00a0\nbrown one is nice but it didn't build as great\u00a0\nit is great on the orange as I was hoping so\u00a0\u00a0\nwith next look I'm actually going to start with\u00a0\nthe darkest first and make sure if that makes it\u00a0\u00a0\neven darker if I start with the darker Shadow\u00a0\nbecause that's usually how it works and if you\u00a0\u00a0\nif you didn't know I love a fully dramatic fully\u00a0\nopaque super dark to super light look so that is\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat we're gonna try and do with the berries and\u00a0\nthe blues so for this look I'm going to be using\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one that's called Mamma Mia and when in Rome\u00a0\nso those are the two I'm going to be using I know\u00a0\u00a0\na lot of people their favorite place in Italy is\u00a0\nRome so far my favorite place in Italy is Florence\nI love Florence it's cute it's old\u00a0\nit's beautiful it's not as big and\u00a0\u00a0\nbusy as Rome and also it's not as much cars\u00a0\nthere as it is in a lot of places in Italy\u00a0\u00a0\nthat is really stunning and it's just it's\u00a0\njust the feeling the food everything is just\u00a0\u00a0\nso beautiful I love that you can walk\u00a0\neverywhere I love walking everywhere\u00a0\u00a0\nand you can go by train really easily in Italy so\u00a0\nif you ever go don't like Rent A Car anything if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou're going in between two cities definitely\u00a0\ntake the train I'm speaking to like maybe more\u00a0\u00a0\nmy American Crew here because I know when I\u00a0\ntalk to Americans about traveling to Europe\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're always talking about renting a car you\u00a0\nreally you don't need to in Europe to rent the car\u00a0\u00a0\njust use public transportation unless you're like\u00a0\nreally going out into like the Wilderness but if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou're just a tourist going between sites I would\u00a0\nsay use public transportation there's really no\u00a0\u00a0\nneed to be having a car and also traveling\u00a0\nby car in these really old European cities\u00a0\u00a0\nnot always the easiest I'm doing one of my\u00a0\nsignature looks for this look just to like\u00a0\u00a0\ntry the colors out and I think that for me when I\u00a0\nwant to try something out for the first time doing\u00a0\u00a0\na signature look something that I know exactly\u00a0\nhow it should be behaving is a really smart way\u00a0\u00a0\nof like seeing about the quality because I can't\u00a0\nremember when or if I tried Too Faced eyeshadows\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm just putting the dark color in the outer\u00a0\nCorner lifting it up a little bit not putting it\u00a0\u00a0\nhere in the inner part because I feel like this\u00a0\njust lifts my eyes so much better and then I'm\u00a0\u00a0\njust gonna blend the edges a little bit with\u00a0\na clean brush really beautiful and then we're\u00a0\u00a0\ntaking the When in Rome oh that is actually\u00a0\nmore pigmented than I thought it was gonna be\noh that's beautiful and we're putting\u00a0\nthis in the inner part of the crease\u00a0\u00a0\nand also on the lid a little bit\nand then we're using just a little\u00a0\nlike bit on the brush just a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit that I have left not picking up\u00a0\nanything more and I'm just brushing\u00a0\u00a0\nthis on the edge to get the like\u00a0\nthe pink Hue on the edge over here\nyou know what I might do because I have two\u00a0\ndifferent poured shimmers here I have this\u00a0\u00a0\nlight blue that I've swatched but I also have this\u00a0\npurple to Pink I might top one eye with each just\u00a0\u00a0\nto show you how this you could create two very\u00a0\ndifferent looks just using these mattes in the\u00a0\u00a0\ncrease and then depending on what Shimmer you\u00a0\nput on because I'm not going to be filming any\u00a0\u00a0\nmore videos after this I'm actually I'm going\u00a0\nto a friend's birthday celebration later today\u00a0\u00a0\nand either I'll go there with one color on each\u00a0\neye or I'll just end up mixing and matching them\u00a0\u00a0\nat the end let me know if you can hear my cat in\u00a0\nthe background I don't think you can but for some\u00a0\u00a0\nreason she is awfully upset about something so\u00a0\nthis is the shade that is called spritzing Glitz\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich is the pink purple oh it definitely needs a\u00a0\nlittle Spritz so let me Spritz again I was trying\u00a0\u00a0\nto just do one without the one with oh my God\u00a0\nlet me see if I can find my kitty so you can\u00a0\u00a0\nsee who's making the noise in the background\u00a0\nbut I don't think you can like really hear it\u00a0\u00a0\nokay this one gave a lot of Fallout like we're\u00a0\ntalking Fallout City maybe this is one of those\u00a0\u00a0\nthat you like finger really is the best yes\u00a0\ndefinitely finger okay sometimes the brush is\u00a0\u00a0\neasier sometimes fingers easier I will say for\u00a0\nmost Shadows it's interchangeable but yeah with\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one definitely definitely fingers I'm gonna\u00a0\ndo the Lake Como which is a blue I've never been\u00a0\u00a0\nto lecomo with my finger I would love to go to\u00a0\nLake Como though oh my God it would be amazing\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe this one needs a little Spritz I'm gonna\u00a0\nSpritz my finger don't judge me you don't get\u00a0\u00a0\nto judge me or maybe a little bit you can judge\u00a0\nme a little bit oh yeah definitely look at that\u00a0\u00a0\noh that's so beautiful why were we\u00a0\nmaking so many noises why are we upset\nshe's like I'm not having any of this not having\u00a0\nany of this okay so I'm gonna use the exact same\u00a0\u00a0\ngelato that I used in my inner Corners before\u00a0\nbecause it was beautiful I'm gonna add a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit more of the dark pink out here I kind of\u00a0\nwanted to add a little bit of the Black Metallic\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I think I'm gonna leave it like this you can\u00a0\nsee it's definitely two different looks one with\u00a0\u00a0\nthe pink and one with the blue oh that did I just\u00a0\nleave that edge all unblended here oopsie but yeah\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm really loving the mattes in this palette so\u00a0\nfar the shimmers are nice they're good but they're\u00a0\u00a0\nnot my absolute favorite but I definitely think\u00a0\nthat this is a really nice palette and I'm excited\u00a0\u00a0\nthat something this bright and fun and good\u00a0\nquality is available uh at like mainstream places\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is the look with the different eyeshadows\u00a0\non like this is a more pink berry look and then of\u00a0\u00a0\ncourse you have this one that's like a berry look\u00a0\nwith a little bit of a pop-up blue I like both of\u00a0\u00a0\nthem honestly and it's really nice to see how you\u00a0\ncan change the look with just a different like lid\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor and of course you could use the black one\u00a0\non top here as well and just make this super super\u00a0\u00a0\nSmoky look that would be beautiful as well and if\u00a0\nyou want to keep it a bit more muted there are a\u00a0\u00a0\ncouple more Goldy coppery versions here plus this\u00a0\nis really dark like tealy blue what I really like\u00a0\u00a0\nabout this palette that we don't usually see from\u00a0\nBrands like Too Faced tart listen you know what\u00a0\u00a0\nwe're talking about this is a half colorful\u00a0\nhalf neutral palette this isn't just a pop of\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor there is a bright pink there is a dark like\u00a0\nburgundy red here this very bright orange this is\u00a0\u00a0\nnot a muted orange this is a bright orange dark\u00a0\nblue light blue like a purpley pink duochrome\u00a0\u00a0\nthere are a couple in this dark Black Metallic I\u00a0\nlove that one I should have used it I did and I'll\u00a0\u00a0\ntry and use this palette again in some kind of a\u00a0\nlook or maybe like a real or something I just find\u00a0\u00a0\nthat this one has more versatility when it comes\u00a0\nto the color Department than you usually see from\u00a0\u00a0\nmainstream brands that like Sephora and Alton I'm\u00a0\nvery excited about that plus this one the shimmers\u00a0\u00a0\nare nice there's nothing wrong with the shimmers\u00a0\nbut the star of the show really are the mattes and\u00a0\u00a0\nthat makes me very happy because sometimes mattes\u00a0\ncan be a little thin or finicky from mainstream\u00a0\u00a0\nBrands I don't know exactly why but I will say I\u00a0\nthink that these are really nice they're blendable\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're buildable they're pigmented but they're\u00a0\nnot too overly pigmented so that they might scare\u00a0\u00a0\nyou like some very pigmented brands are that I\u00a0\ntruly love but I still think that there's nothing\u00a0\u00a0\nthin or like non-pigmented about these I'm very\u00a0\nimpressed I will for sure be playing with this\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit more before I give you my absolute\u00a0\nfinal verdict but right now I'm definitely giving\u00a0\u00a0\nthis a thumbs up I think that this is a really\u00a0\ngood palette and this might be the comeback that\u00a0\u00a0\nToo Faced might have needed when it comes to like\u00a0\ngetting a little bit more hype on social media\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I will say I think this palette is kind of\u00a0\nfun and appealing in a way that's not just super\u00a0\u00a0\nneutral there's a little bit of a there's a little\u00a0\nbit of a spritz to it there's something extra to\u00a0\u00a0\nit I would love to hear your thoughts about this\u00a0\npalette did you pick it up are you aiming to pick\u00a0\u00a0\nit up what do you think about the looks I would\u00a0\nlove to hear all about it down in the comments\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't forget to subscribe and I will see you\u00a0\nagain tomorrow for my new makeup releases bye\n[Music] [Applause]\n[Music]",

You can choose the coverage too, it\u2019s buildable. So if you picked a too intense color like wicked apple, you can put it on your finger and dab over your lips and it will look super natural but more flustered. 10/10 product",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

        "transcript_text": "Hello beautiful and welcome back to\u00a0\nmy channel and welcome to this video\u00a0\u00a0\nwhere we are going to talk about\u00a0\nthe colourpop target situation\u00a0\u00a0\nsituation we are going to chat about the things\u00a0\nthat are available because colourpop has launched\u00a0\u00a0\nquite a few products at Target it's more than\u00a0\n100 products and I am going to go through from\u00a0\u00a0\nstarting from primer ending at lip gloss and\u00a0\nI'm gonna let you know my thoughts about these\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts because I have tried most of them I'm\u00a0\nalso going to do a full face of colourpop at\u00a0\u00a0\nTarget while we talk about this letting you\u00a0\nknow which things I think are amazing and you\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely maybe could pick up if you're in\u00a0\nthe market for new makeup and which things I\u00a0\u00a0\nactually think are not good and you definitely can\u00a0\nfind some better Alternatives at a drugstore and\u00a0\u00a0\nif you haven't been there before do consider\u00a0\nsubscribing because I do upload quite a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nof videos every week all about makeup All About\u00a0\nBeauty all about having fun with makeup and beauty\n[Music] one of the things that are available\u00a0\nat Target from colourpop is the pretty fresh\u00a0\u00a0\nhyaluronic acid painted moisturizer I've used this\u00a0\none for years and this one is still available at\u00a0\u00a0\ncolourpop as well I have mine in medium 9W and\u00a0\nthis is the one that I'm going to take my ring\u00a0\u00a0\noff because this is the one that I'm going\u00a0\nto be using today let me actually shake it\u00a0\u00a0\nI use this with my fingers I feel like this is\u00a0\nthe best way of using this one this is a very\u00a0\u00a0\n40 this is a very light coverage hello\nsir sir okay there we go this is a very light\u00a0\ncoverage very liquidy I feel like what's her\u00a0\u00a0\nname Meredith Duxbury is that her name is that\u00a0\nher I feel like her just with less Foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nI guess for me since this is a tinted moisturizer\u00a0\nit works the best with my hands and I work it in\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's also a primer the primer is a no filter\u00a0\nprimer mat I didn't even know colourpop had that\u00a0\u00a0\nI kind of want to try it and then there is the\u00a0\npretty fresh Foundation that one I have tried\u00a0\u00a0\nand I didn't love it on me I thought it looked a\u00a0\nlittle heavy it didn't look super flattering in\u00a0\u00a0\nmy skin I have combo skin I am 39 and I live in\u00a0\na humid climate so I need something that looks a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle smoothing and it doesn't look heavy on my\u00a0\nskin and I think that this one does that so I work\u00a0\u00a0\nit in with my hands like I would a moisturizer and\u00a0\nthen I use a sponge and I bounce it in at the end\u00a0\u00a0\npretty much like Meredith Oxford is she murdered\u00a0\nthat's her name you know the foundation lady\nscares me but I think that when it comes to\u00a0\ntinted moisturizers I actually think that we\u00a0\u00a0\nhave a similar technique so this is what I\u00a0\ndo with this one the pretty fresh one and if\u00a0\u00a0\nI set this one with powder it wears extremely\u00a0\ngracefully throughout the entire day and when\u00a0\u00a0\nit wears off it doesn't break up it doesn't\u00a0\nwear off in patches it just wears off hello\u00a0\u00a0\nsir it just wears off really gracefully and I have\u00a0\nbeen loving this product for years and if you're\u00a0\u00a0\nlooking for a tinted moisturizer at a drugstore\u00a0\nI would definitely recommend this one but I need\u00a0\u00a0\nto wash my hands in the worst way actually let us\u00a0\nzoom in a little bit so we can see something and\u00a0\u00a0\nI can come a little closer that's Perfection\u00a0\nI feel like the prices of colourpop items are\u00a0\u00a0\npretty typical drugstore at this point I think\u00a0\nthis one is like 16. this is 15 and the other\u00a0\u00a0\nFoundation is 16. they also have a concealer that\u00a0\nis the pretty fresh concealer that one I have the\u00a0\u00a0\ncollector I didn't like that on my under eyes I\u00a0\nthought it was a little bit too heavy they also\u00a0\u00a0\nhave the no filter setting powder I don't think\u00a0\nI have tried that one but I don't have it but\u00a0\u00a0\nI am going to use some of my favorites at the\u00a0\ndrugstore which I would really recommend that\u00a0\u00a0\nI will leave a link to these down below this\u00a0\nis the Super Stay activewear from Maybelline\u00a0\u00a0\nit's wonderful on more textured I am under eyes\u00a0\nand then it is the Covergirl Advanced Radiance\u00a0\u00a0\npowder I use this under my eyes I think both of\u00a0\nthese work amazingly and I definitely prefer this\u00a0\u00a0\nconcealer over the colourpop one if you're looking\u00a0\nfor a concealer at at the drugstore I also really\u00a0\u00a0\nlike the bear with me concealer from NYX I think\u00a0\nthat one is a really good one at the drugstore\u00a0\u00a0\ntoo those are probably like my favorite ones at\u00a0\nthe drugstore this one is very liquidy and just\u00a0\u00a0\nfor me it wears beautifully throughout the day\u00a0\nso I will say when it comes to like concealers\u00a0\u00a0\nfoundations and stuff like that I definitely\u00a0\nhave other drugstore favorites than colourpop\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I like this tinted moisturizer although\u00a0\nI will admit I haven't worn it in a bit and\u00a0\u00a0\nwith this powder I just use a poof mine is from\u00a0\nLH cosmetics and I just set the under eyes and\u00a0\u00a0\naround my nose which is where I tend to get oily\u00a0\nand a little bit in my T-Zone and I'm watching\u00a0\u00a0\nthe rest I am gonna leave B we actually\u00a0\nhave about 30 degrees Celsius which is\u00a0\u00a0\n80s I think here in Austin today so I'm\u00a0\ndefinitely going to need a little powder\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen it comes to brow products uh what I really\u00a0\nlike from colourpop is actually not available\u00a0\u00a0\nat Target and that is their wonderful tinted brow\u00a0\ngel they have the brow gel in a clear one I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nknow if it's the same formula as the colored ones\u00a0\nbut I love their color color brown gels those are\u00a0\u00a0\nabsolutely amazing I think the brow pens are good\u00a0\nbut they're not my favorite brow pens it's more\u00a0\u00a0\nof a if those are the ones available and if you\u00a0\nfind them in your color definitely go for it I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink NYX makes amazing brow products and if I\u00a0\nwere to recommend some brow products from the\u00a0\u00a0\ndrugstore I would definitely go with NYX if I'm\u00a0\ngoing to be totally honest but I do think that the\u00a0\u00a0\ntinted brow gel from colourpop was my favorite for\u00a0\nyears and years and years I used to use that like\u00a0\u00a0\nI've probably gone through six or seven of those\u00a0\nbut they don't have the tinted version at Target\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so I did my brows off camera but I did get\u00a0\nsome stuff sent to me from colourpop and then I\u00a0\u00a0\ndid buy a couple of things myself over at Target\u00a0\nas well and they sent me two of the brow pencils\u00a0\u00a0\nso I have brown I think it's brunette and dark\u00a0\nbrown neither of these are my shade because you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan tell that I'm more of a ginger right now so\u00a0\nthat's why I'm not trying out any of these today\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I do have a little spoolie and it's like a\u00a0\nreally fine tip so I I definitely do recommend\u00a0\u00a0\nthe brow products from colourpop at Target or\u00a0\nfrom colourpop all together I just don't have\u00a0\u00a0\nI just don't have any to try with you today I\u00a0\ndid buy this one myself so this is the bronzer\u00a0\u00a0\nthe powder bronzer and I actually have not tried\u00a0\nthis one this is a new packaging over at Target\u00a0\u00a0\nso that you can see the shade through all of\u00a0\nthe things at Target have gotten packaging\u00a0\u00a0\nthat fits a drugstore where you cannot Swatch\u00a0\nthings so I got the bronzer in Avila Beach and\u00a0\u00a0\nis this still light for me let's try it out and\u00a0\nsee so I did buy this myself and I haven't tried\u00a0\u00a0\ntheir powder bronzer but I love with a burning\u00a0\npassion they're super shock bronzer so this is\u00a0\u00a0\njust the setting powder at this point no it's a\u00a0\nlittle darker it's a little darker let me just\u00a0\u00a0\nwork this in okay so I obviously got a shade that\u00a0\nwas too light for me which is I mean it's giving\u00a0\u00a0\nyou squint a little bit if you squint a little\u00a0\nbit it's giving something but obviously I got a\u00a0\u00a0\nshade that was too light I think there was even a\u00a0\nshade that was lighter than this one so if you're\u00a0\u00a0\nvery fair you should be able to find a shade\u00a0\num but this is um clearly not my shade [Music]\num yeah so this wasn't my shade that that's on me\u00a0\nthat's on me but I thought the formula felt nice\u00a0\u00a0\nand it wasn't too pigmented which is really nice I\u00a0\ndon't like bronzers blushes and highlighters that\u00a0\u00a0\nare too overly pigmented because it just makes it\u00a0\nlook stupid when you get it on the skin it's hard\u00a0\u00a0\nto work with I mean it's giving something it's\u00a0\ngiving something let's work it he worked I also\u00a0\u00a0\nsaw that they had some Super Shock blushes over\u00a0\nat Target but I will say that only one of their\u00a0\u00a0\nSuper Shock blushes was the kind of super sharp\u00a0\nblush that I love which is the shimmery one and\u00a0\u00a0\nthey had I think five mattes and one shimmery\u00a0\none but the shimmery one was a dark one so I per\u00a0\u00a0\nI love the Super Shock formula is amazing it is\u00a0\na cream to powder formula that feels like putty\u00a0\u00a0\nit is beautiful you can use it with a brush you\u00a0\ncan use it with a sponge you can use it with a\u00a0\u00a0\nfinger I prefer using it with a brush but I will\u00a0\nsay it is a beautiful beautiful formula let me go\u00a0\u00a0\nget a brush and we can use this one as a blush\u00a0\nbecause this is the one that has Shimmer in it\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is drop of a hat this is available over at\u00a0\ncolourpop but I will say I love the Super Shock\u00a0\u00a0\nformula but I prefer glowy blush so I think that\u00a0\nwhen it comes to Target I would prefer the Super\u00a0\u00a0\nShock highlighters that they have over the blushes\u00a0\nbecause most of them are matte but if you love a\u00a0\u00a0\nmatte blush that had some options so we are\u00a0\ngoing to just use a little bit of this blush\u00a0\u00a0\nand this drop of a hat is a blush that I had had\u00a0\nfor several years and it's just this beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nwarm Peach with a gold Sheen and I just think\u00a0\nit's so beautiful and I just I just love this\u00a0\u00a0\nformula if you just want a soft wash of color with\u00a0\nlike just a little Sheen use a fluffier brush like\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one if you want your highlighter to show\u00a0\nup a little bit more pigmented use a more dense\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlighter brush or your finger but I do prefer\u00a0\na dense highlighter brush I think that that looks\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful since the bronzer was giving well it\u00a0\nwas putting in minimal effort okay it was put\u00a0\u00a0\nit was putting in the bare minimum I thought that\u00a0\nmaybe a little blushy moment could be the thing\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm actually going to be using this because\u00a0\nI've never used this this was was sent to me\u00a0\u00a0\nand this one is available over at Target and\u00a0\nthis is lunch money so this is a Super Shock\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlighter and this is in lunch money so let's\u00a0\nSwatch this that is giving light let's actually\u00a0\u00a0\nuse my finger now that I have it on okay this\u00a0\nis a little bit of an icy champagne I prefer\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething that is a little bit closer to my skin\u00a0\ntone but this is definitely definitely works on\u00a0\u00a0\nme I feel like it has a somewhat transparent\u00a0\nbass which usually makes these kind of Shades\u00a0\u00a0\nstretch over more skin tones but they did have\u00a0\ndifferent shades to choose from and they also\u00a0\u00a0\nhave a pink highlighter which is called Monster\u00a0\nif you're into trying like a duochrome highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\none of those that are like a pink Sheen I saw\u00a0\nthat they had monster over at Target so as you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan tell that is a really really intense Sheen\u00a0\nand there is no Glitter just a Sheen wow that\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlighter is actually really really pretty on\u00a0\nthe skin I'm kind of impressed by how that looks\u00a0\u00a0\nI mean Super Shock shakes are the glowy and like\u00a0\njust the metallic and the shimmery Super Shock\u00a0\u00a0\nformulas from colourpop is my favorite makeup\u00a0\nformula of all times and I'm so excited that\u00a0\u00a0\nyou now can go into a Target and find it there\u00a0\nso don't be overly surprised that I am impressed\u00a0\u00a0\nby this formula I think I put a lip liner here\u00a0\nokay here's the thing if you've followed me for a\u00a0\u00a0\nreally long time I used to say that I didn't like\u00a0\nthe lip liners by colourpop because I thought that\u00a0\u00a0\nthey were too smeary like they were too creamy to\u00a0\na point where they were hard to be precise with\u00a0\u00a0\nbut then I tried a couple of newer colors I think\u00a0\nlast year and I kind of changed my mind so I want\u00a0\u00a0\nto try this one this one is a BFF this is one of\u00a0\nthe lip liners that are available at Target there\u00a0\u00a0\nare like six ish colors available at Target and\u00a0\nI want to try an original color because this is\u00a0\u00a0\nan old color but a new packaging and I want to\u00a0\nsee if they reformulated the old colors as well\u00a0\u00a0\nor if I just change my mind or if the old colors\u00a0\nhave the same super smoothie formula and it's just\u00a0\u00a0\nthe newer colors that have a better not as\u00a0\nmemory formula so this is like a test for me\nno they have definitely reformulated new ones\u00a0\nas well so now I will say that I do recommend\u00a0\u00a0\nthe colourpop lip liners because they are not\u00a0\nas overly smeary creamy as they used to be in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe very beginning they were so creamy that they\u00a0\nalmost became too much it was hard to be precise\u00a0\u00a0\nwith them because it was almost so creamy that\u00a0\nyou just ended up having wonky lines because\u00a0\u00a0\nit was just too much but this one definitely a\u00a0\nbig Improvement and like I said this is BFF and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen we're gonna go in with one of my favorite\u00a0\nlip formulas that launched last year and I'm so\u00a0\u00a0\nexcited that you now can find it at Target okay\u00a0\nprepare yourself for a barrage of lip products\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm going to let you know about the things that\u00a0\nthey have available right now at Target let me\u00a0\u00a0\njust scroll into the lip products so that we can\u00a0\ntalk about them and I can let you know what I\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel about them because the lip liners I already\u00a0\nlet you know I think that those are really good\u00a0\u00a0\nI think they have reformulated them I really\u00a0\nlike them then we have the blotted lips I've\u00a0\u00a0\nhad them I have the collected them I think they\u00a0\nare drying on the lips I think they're the kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof product that yeah they do give you a super\u00a0\nmatte blotted look but they're also very drying\u00a0\u00a0\nso for me I need to put something on top and if\u00a0\nI'm going to put something on top I might as well\u00a0\u00a0\njust do a hydrating lipstick to begin with why\u00a0\nwould I start with a blotted lip so they're not\u00a0\u00a0\nmy favorite then we have the classical and Lippy\u00a0\nsticks this is a Trio that came out I don't know\u00a0\u00a0\nif they still have the set in store but I do\u00a0\nknow that they have this set online at least I\u00a0\u00a0\nsaw it and then colourpop also sent me a couple of\u00a0\nsingles they are like slim lipsticks and they come\u00a0\u00a0\nout like this the ones that I have seen they smell\u00a0\nlike vanilla the ones that I have seen are either\u00a0\u00a0\nmatte this is Parker and Matt or they are the\u00a0\nmatte X formula the difference between the matte\u00a0\u00a0\nand the math X formula is that the matte ones are\u00a0\nmore of a velvety almost leaning a little bit on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Comfort mat and then the matte X they are a\u00a0\nsilicone mat they are completely matte on the lips\u00a0\u00a0\nbut they're still not that drying tuggy matte but\u00a0\nthey're more of a silicone mat if you wanted to\u00a0\u00a0\nknow the difference between the two then we have\u00a0\nthe tint the lip tints these are like crayons I've\u00a0\u00a0\ntried these before as well and in the beginning\u00a0\nI didn't love them they're like little chubby\u00a0\u00a0\ncrayons like this let me not open it you can see\u00a0\nit in here because I like I said I'm going to be\u00a0\u00a0\ngiving these away personally I like this one only\u00a0\nin a color because I like the color and that is\u00a0\u00a0\nthe red one that they had in collab with the High\u00a0\nSchool Musical I know some people really love this\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is like a sheer somewhat balmy glowy look on\u00a0\nthe lips with a little bit of color I prefer other\u00a0\u00a0\ncolored Bombs over this one because I don't think\u00a0\nthat this is really hydrating but if you can find\u00a0\u00a0\na color you really like you might like them again\u00a0\nthis isn't my favorite formula from colourpop but\u00a0\u00a0\nI do like these formulas this is the so glassy\u00a0\nlipstick or lip gloss this is in local it's one\u00a0\u00a0\nof the colors that I got sent I'm not gonna be\u00a0\ntrying out this one because I have a bunch of so\u00a0\u00a0\nglassy lip glosses in my collection and I really\u00a0\nlike the formula at first I didn't like it but\u00a0\u00a0\nit's actually a more almost like a little thicker\u00a0\nso it like lays on and looks more voluminizing on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe lip but it's not overly sticky but I know\u00a0\nthat I tried this first time I was like oh it's\u00a0\u00a0\nso sticky but actually it's more that it's a\u00a0\nlittle thicker and Lace on the lips it's not\u00a0\u00a0\nthat it is sticky and I needed to try it a little\u00a0\nbit more to differentiate between the two too\u00a0\u00a0\nso I do like this so glassy lip glosses they are\u00a0\nextremely shiny on the lips so if you're looking\u00a0\u00a0\nfor something super shiny at the drugstore I would\u00a0\ndefinitely recommend these and then the Luxe lip\u00a0\u00a0\noils these are some of my favorite products I\u00a0\nhave so many in my collections if you're looking\u00a0\u00a0\nfor lip oil from the drugstore I really like\u00a0\nthese again I'm not going to be keeping these\u00a0\u00a0\ntwo because I have so many in my collections the\u00a0\none that have color I will say it's not giving a\u00a0\u00a0\nbunch of color this is giving a light tint on the\u00a0\nlips this one for example is just going to give a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle beigey milkiness to the lips it's gonna\u00a0\nprobably look really flattering on the lips but\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't think you're gonna get like it's not gonna\u00a0\ngive this kind of a color and if you're choosing\u00a0\u00a0\nbetween a Light Beige and a middle Brown they're\u00a0\nprobably going to give this a similar effect on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe lips so you definitely do not need a lot of\u00a0\nthese like I like a pink and a brown if you love\u00a0\u00a0\nthe formula it's probably going to give you as\u00a0\ndifferent as they are to be honest but I do have\u00a0\u00a0\nsome that are more a little brighter in color and\u00a0\nthose I see more of a difference on the lips but\u00a0\u00a0\nI really do like this formula then we have some\u00a0\nthat I don't have here I'm not 100 sure if I even\u00a0\u00a0\ntried this formula I probably should it is the\u00a0\nglossy lip stain which is a glossy lipstick that\u00a0\u00a0\nleaves a stain on the lips I feel like I have\u00a0\ntried this but I think I had a color that I did\u00a0\u00a0\ncollector because I have a little like a little\u00a0\nmemory that's playing in the back of my head and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen uh on the colourpop website you also have\u00a0\nthe Fresh Kiss good like lip it is a lip cream\u00a0\u00a0\nand I hate that formula the glossy lip stain if\u00a0\nI don't remember incorrectly because I do think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I've tried it but it's the lip creams that I\u00a0\nreally hate it is a smeary liquid lipstick formula\u00a0\u00a0\nthat travels all over your face but I didn't find\u00a0\nthat at um the the Target website I only saw that\u00a0\u00a0\nat colourpop and they also have a lip lacquer a\u00a0\nFresh Kiss lip lacquer same there I only found\u00a0\u00a0\nthat at colourpop and those are the different lip\u00a0\nformulas that they have play they have the glowing\u00a0\u00a0\nlips colourpop did not send me any of these this\u00a0\none I bought myself but I know that this color is\u00a0\u00a0\nin indulge me which you can see I've used quite a\u00a0\nlot of this one this one is available at Target I\u00a0\u00a0\nactually wore this color just the other day\u00a0\nI had to go downstairs on the lips but still\u00a0\u00a0\ngives color it's not as glossy as those click up\u00a0\nlipsticks from and make it by Mario or from tarte\u00a0\u00a0\nbut they are in the same kind of a dimension as\u00a0\nthose just a glossy lipstick and I really do like\u00a0\u00a0\nthese and they have several different colors\u00a0\nat Target so I would definitely recommend like\u00a0\u00a0\nthese if you're going to Target to buy some lip\u00a0\nproducts the glossy lip products from colourpop\u00a0\u00a0\nare really good and I do like uh the Lippy sticks\u00a0\nas well but for some reason I don't have a lot in\u00a0\u00a0\nmy collection and I think it might be just that I\u00a0\nhaven't found the right colors for me that totally\u00a0\u00a0\nlike embody what I like right now but I don't\u00a0\nlisten dislike the formula at all let's go in\u00a0\u00a0\nto some eye products because I do have a couple\u00a0\nof palettes here and I'm going to be using one\u00a0\u00a0\nof them today I just quickly want to tell you\u00a0\nthat these color sticks the eyeshadow sticks\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom colourpop they aren't good you don't need\u00a0\nto buy this product this product isn't good you\u00a0\u00a0\nreally really don't need to buy it another product\u00a0\nthat I have that I think I bought myself and then\u00a0\u00a0\nI got some NPR as well are the party proof eye\u00a0\nprimer this is also available Target I also do not\u00a0\u00a0\nrecommend this product I really do not like this\u00a0\neye primer at all and if you are looking for a new\u00a0\u00a0\neye primer I definitely would not recommend this\u00a0\none I don't think that this makes your eyeshadow\u00a0\u00a0\ngo on more pigmented or anything like that I\u00a0\njust think it is a smeary not my favorite other\u00a0\u00a0\npeople's favorite but not my favorite I would\u00a0\nsteer you in a different direction but then we\u00a0\u00a0\nhave the the eyeshadow palettes I have a stack\u00a0\nof eyeshadow palettes here and I'm going to show\u00a0\u00a0\nyou close-ups of all of these eyeshadow palettes\u00a0\nnow just so you can see how these look a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit more close up but I'm going to be using the\u00a0\none that I'm showing you last on my eyes today\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I feel like that one is the one that is\u00a0\nnot only most my style because it is the blue one\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's called Blue Velvet it is also one that you\u00a0\nmight not see everyone using on YouTube because I\u00a0\u00a0\nwanted to do something blue and show you how fun\u00a0\nand how flattering blue eyeshadow really can be\u00a0\u00a0\non the eyes and when I Swatch this palette it's\u00a0\nswatched absolutely beautiful and I'm so excited\u00a0\u00a0\nto be digging into this one I did notice that one\u00a0\nof these Shadows the Shimmer one at the bottom it\u00a0\u00a0\nfelt a little bit not like a pressed glitter but I\u00a0\ncould definitely see glitter particles in it and I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink this is one of the new because when I look\u00a0\nat the back there are no eye safety warnings on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe back and I think that this is one of the new\u00a0\nprescriptive formulas from colourpop where they\u00a0\u00a0\nare like having smaller glitter particles within\u00a0\nthe eyeshadow and actually making it eyes safe so\u00a0\u00a0\njust know that even some of these seem a little\u00a0\nalmost sparkly to the point of being glittery\u00a0\u00a0\nthere are no ice safety warnings on the back so\u00a0\nthese are all considered eye shadows just so you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow FYI I also wanted to compare some of these\u00a0\npalettes the first palette that's called gone\u00a0\u00a0\nmetal I wanted to compare it to the off quartz\u00a0\npalette and I do think that if you have the off\u00a0\u00a0\ncourse palette you don't need the other silvery\u00a0\nlike gray neutral palette you don't need that\u00a0\u00a0\none also the blue velvet palette is very similar\u00a0\nto the Blue Moon palette not to the point that\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're dupes I don't think there's any Shades in\u00a0\nthese palettes are actually dupes but if you don't\u00a0\u00a0\nuse blue eyeshadow enough you might not need both\u00a0\nof them for sure and I also wanted to compare the\u00a0\u00a0\ngreen palette to the new palette Sage today and\u00a0\nthe one that is called the child palette which\u00a0\u00a0\nwas a collab palette with Queen Star Wars and\u00a0\ncolourpop it came out like two years ago all three\u00a0\u00a0\nof these palettes are if not they're not dupes\u00a0\nI don't know if any of the shades are straight\u00a0\u00a0\nupdos but they are so similar that you definitely\u00a0\ndo not need all three of them I have all three\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I've been sent two of them as PR but if I\u00a0\nwas just in makeup consumer I definitely would not\u00a0\u00a0\nneed all three so if you own any of these other\u00a0\ntwo Pals you definitely do not need the other\u00a0\u00a0\ngreen one from a colourpop as well and I'm sure\u00a0\nthat these two the two like nudie ones here if you\u00a0\u00a0\nhave any of these other like nudie caramelly Brown\u00a0\npalettes from colourpop nine pants you definitely\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't need these so make sure that you are not\u00a0\ngetting dupes because even though these palettes\u00a0\u00a0\nare really pretty they're really nice like\u00a0\nmonochromatic little nine pen palettes they're not\u00a0\u00a0\nthis isn't a new ID for colourpop they've done\u00a0\nthis before and the reason why I bought this blue\u00a0\u00a0\none instead of the Blue Moon even though I own\u00a0\nit is because the blue is my favorite eyeshadow\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor ever this is one of the most used palettes\u00a0\nin my collection but it's old so I wanted to see\u00a0\u00a0\nif I could get a similar effect with this one\u00a0\nand just get maybe a new replacement for it\u00a0\u00a0\nthey also have a bunch of Super Shock shadows I'm\u00a0\nagain not going to be opening these I got a bunch\u00a0\u00a0\nof them but I'm gonna put this in an upcoming\u00a0\ngiveaway they have singles and they have Duos\u00a0\u00a0\nand I really really light so they're from neutrals\u00a0\nthis is a champagne with pink glitter a purple and\u00a0\u00a0\nagain this is champagne with purple glitter really\u00a0\npretty again cream to powder Shadows that you can\u00a0\u00a0\nuse either with your finger or a brush and these\u00a0\nare good quality and especially if you're the kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof person they want to just do a little bit of\u00a0\neyeshadow put it on your lid do some mascara and\u00a0\u00a0\nbe out the door these are going to be perfect for\u00a0\nyou just know that you might be able to see the\u00a0\u00a0\nShimmer and the different sparkles more in store\u00a0\nthan you would online so do check them out if you\u00a0\u00a0\nare able in store otherwise I will say this is\u00a0\na great formula and if you think that you would\u00a0\u00a0\nget good use out of these they do not create\u00a0\na lot of Need for example I definitely would\u00a0\u00a0\nrecommend them and like I said in the beginning\u00a0\nor if I didn't I'm telling you right now check\u00a0\u00a0\nthe description box I will link all of these\u00a0\nthings definitely recommend the Super Shock\u00a0\u00a0\nShadows they are beautiful I also have some cream\u00a0\ngel liners and liquid liners I like both of these\u00a0\u00a0\nformulas and again if you're looking for a new\u00a0\ncolored liner or a neutral liner either liquid\u00a0\u00a0\nor a gel pencil I recommend both of these\u00a0\nformulas as well and I'm going to be using\u00a0\u00a0\none of them okay let me do some primer not this\u00a0\nprimer we're doing another primer not that one\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I love you but I don't love you that much\u00a0\nI'm do I'm gonna do my favorite uh primer on\u00a0\u00a0\nmy eyes and then we're gonna do blue I'm sorry\u00a0\nthat I was talking for so long but I really just\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to recommend to you which ones are good and\u00a0\nwhich ones you can just skip don't get the eye\u00a0\u00a0\nprimer okay spend your money on good stuff that\u00a0\nisn't good stuff okay I'm just gonna do a quick\u00a0\u00a0\nlook for you I think I'm gonna do an all matte\u00a0\nlook because I love an all-matte look I mean you\u00a0\u00a0\nsaw the swatches so I think I'm gonna use this\u00a0\none and maybe this one and then I don't know I\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't know I don't know but I'm gonna try the one\u00a0\nthat's called Capri I'm gonna start with that one\u00a0\u00a0\nah so pretty when you're working with blue\u00a0\neyeshadows or green eyeshadows or whatever\u00a0\u00a0\nlike bright matte that you think is a little\u00a0\nhard to work with try to press it into your\u00a0\u00a0\nprimer without setting your primer don't set your\u00a0\nprimer press the eyeshadow in and then with small\u00a0\u00a0\nmotions small small you do small circular ones\u00a0\njust around the edge to soften it up a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nand we're leaving it like this and then we're\u00a0\ngonna blend the edge with another color but\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't go like blue eyeshadow doesn't like that\u00a0\nokay so I'm gonna do this one now it's called\nI should know this I'm an 80s baby I was born in\u00a0\nthe middle of the 80s so I was a teenager when we\u00a0\u00a0\nwere doing this like 90s disco it was truly a\u00a0\nfun time to be alive so I'm just putting this\u00a0\u00a0\non the edge and a little bit in here it's because\u00a0\nit's easier to blend out this like lighter shade\u00a0\u00a0\nbut don't over blend because we don't\u00a0\nwant it to be too muddy but I'm putting\u00a0\u00a0\nthis lighter shade on the edge and then I'm\u00a0\njust blending that one out a little bit more\u00a0\u00a0\nto make this a little bit softer and a little bit\u00a0\nmore flowing and not so Sharpie as it is here you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan see the difference like it's just a little\u00a0\nbit more flowy I also put some under my eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is how I am doing a quick blue eye\u00a0\nlook and I'm also going to be using some of\u00a0\u00a0\nthese shades on my eyes but I think I'm going\u00a0\nto darken it up I think I might take this one\u00a0\u00a0\nactually the super dark one that's called\u00a0\nat midnight I might actually use that one\u00a0\u00a0\nto darken up with and just use a little bit here\u00a0\nin the outer corner okay I'm just applying some of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe of the darkest shade now in the outer corner\u00a0\nand and the outer part of the lid and I think\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna do the absolute lightest shade it's\u00a0\ncalled Forever mood I'm gonna do that on the lid\u00a0\u00a0\nbut this looks really incredible and I think\u00a0\nthat this is very pigmented and very pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nI mean for being a blue shadow Blues are always\u00a0\na little bit more tricky to work with but so far\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm not having any weird problems and I mean\u00a0\nlike I said blue is my favorite eyeshadow\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor and I feel like I'm pretty good at Blue\u00a0\nI'm pretty good at distinguishing if it is a\u00a0\u00a0\ndecent formula or not okay so this is the light\u00a0\npastel blue oh if you have not been on my channel\u00a0\u00a0\nbefore you might not know my absolute recent what\u00a0\nI say recent recent two years of obsession with\u00a0\u00a0\nmixing pastel shades with darker Shades and just\u00a0\nmaking this the most like dramatic ever I love\u00a0\u00a0\nall matte looks and I love a dark saturated look\u00a0\ntogether with a pastel to create contrast and then\u00a0\u00a0\nto use the matte pastel in my inner corner and\u00a0\na little bit like here and just to brighten up\u00a0\u00a0\nwithout using a shimmer because I have noticed\u00a0\nlike I said I'm 39 I've noticed with time\u00a0\u00a0\nthat my eye looks just look smoother and just a\u00a0\nlittle better uh when I do a matte inner corner\u00a0\u00a0\nso if you are in my age bracket I would a\u00a0\nmillion percent recommend you to try a mat\u00a0\u00a0\nin a corner maybe just a matte beige or a matte\u00a0\nwhite to be honest it's just really really pretty\nI mean I think that that looks great let\u00a0\nme see if I can just follow up with this\u00a0\u00a0\njust blend The Edge a little bit here\u00a0\nwith the brush with the dark color\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I mean that is a 14 eyeshadow palette\u00a0\nfrom Target that's impressive that's\nimpressive so I have a couple of the liquid\u00a0\nliners here I have it in the black the brown\u00a0\u00a0\nand the white the white in Graceland you've\u00a0\nseen me use that so many times on my channel if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou're looking for a white liquid liner I cannot\u00a0\nrecommend graceline Graceland enough and then I\u00a0\u00a0\nhave some cream gel liners and same here they sent\u00a0\nme some more neutral colors it is a white it is a\u00a0\u00a0\nblack and it is a beige so I'm gonna use the white\u00a0\none but I have that over here so I don't need to\u00a0\u00a0\nunpack this one they also have some mascaras here\u00a0\nI have actually where is my other mascara hold\u00a0\u00a0\nhere here are the mascaras that are available at\u00a0\nTarget it is the level up lengthening mascara I\u00a0\u00a0\nactually have not tried this yet but I have this\u00a0\nmyself and then they sent me the act natural\u00a0\u00a0\ndefining mascara are both these in Black both\u00a0\nof these are in Black so maybe we can try these\u00a0\u00a0\nmascaras that I've never tried on one eye each and\u00a0\nwe can see if there's any difference and then we\u00a0\u00a0\nhave the BFF voluminizing mascara and these are\u00a0\nin color so I have the red one here and obviously\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's not correct for this they do have the blue\u00a0\none as well I should have been smart and bought\u00a0\u00a0\nthe blue one so we could have used that with this\u00a0\nbut I didn't but a colored mascara is always fun\u00a0\u00a0\nand especially just on your lower lash line and\u00a0\nthen you can do black on your upper lashes if you\u00a0\u00a0\nwant that really actually like these I don't use a\u00a0\nlot of colored mascaras but if you're looking for\u00a0\u00a0\nblue or a red one these are Target actually pretty\u00a0\ndecent so let's try the level up should I be\u00a0\u00a0\ncurling my lashes a little bit let's try the level\u00a0\nup on this side uh this is an old uh from Makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nGeek I think Makeup Geek is closing down their\u00a0\nsite now so this one will no longer be available I\u00a0\u00a0\ndo like the one from Redford as well this has like\u00a0\na cone shaped pretty long but a little bit slimmer\nbrush I will say this is actually kind of a good\u00a0\nmascara I really like it I like an elongating\u00a0\u00a0\nmascara that really grips onto my hairs and\u00a0\nbends them upwards and I really think that\u00a0\u00a0\nthis brush does that and I like having long\u00a0\nlashes over having voluminized lashes and I\u00a0\u00a0\nreally think that this one did a good job at that\u00a0\nso that mascara I kind of like it let's do the\u00a0\u00a0\nsame on the other eye and then we can do the act\u00a0\nnatural one what does a defining mascara even mean\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so this one has a much thicker brush\u00a0\nI prefer a Slimmer brush okay this brush\u00a0\u00a0\ndoes not grip onto the lashes the way that the\u00a0\nother one did and I don't feel like this one\u00a0\u00a0\nis giving this same good result as the other\u00a0\none did I do think the other one is going to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe my favorite but it was also described as\u00a0\na lengthening mascara so I'm not surprised\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know what this mascara is supposed\u00a0\nto do because honestly it's not doing much\u00a0\u00a0\ndefining mascara defining what defining I\u00a0\ndon't know if you can see but I definitely\u00a0\u00a0\ncan see there is a much better result for my\u00a0\nlashes on this side than it is on this side so\u00a0\u00a0\ndo with that information as you please okay so\u00a0\nI located my white liner this one is from The\u00a0\u00a0\nHigh School Musical collection but it is an exit\u00a0\nwhich is the white liner that is also available at\u00a0\u00a0\num targets I think that this is just like another\u00a0\npackaging for an already existing liner and I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink that this one is a really good white liner\u00a0\nand overall I think that the cream gel liners from\u00a0\u00a0\ncolourpop are good quality liners they had some\u00a0\nDuds back in the day but I do think that they have\u00a0\u00a0\nbeen able to perfect the formula a little bit and\u00a0\nget rid of some of the Duds or perfect like those\u00a0\u00a0\nDuds as well and re-release them better because\u00a0\nI think that these are a good quality product\u00a0\u00a0\nat the drugstore and if you're looking for a\u00a0\ncolored liner definitely definitely recommend\u00a0\u00a0\nit let me put on some falsies I'm not going to\u00a0\nbe using colourpop falsies I haven't seen those\u00a0\u00a0\nat Target and I also don't love I don't love the\u00a0\ncolourpop falsely stuff I'm going to be honest\u00a0\u00a0\nso I can finish this uh whole look up and we can\u00a0\nhave a chat about like top three products I would\u00a0\u00a0\nrecommend if you're shopping colourpop at Target\u00a0\nand also the three products I would not recommend\u00a0\u00a0\nactually there are a couple of products that are\u00a0\navailable from colabob at Target that I didn't\u00a0\u00a0\nmention now and one of them is like the glittery\u00a0\nobsessed it's like a glitter encapsulated in the\u00a0\u00a0\ngel that you can put whatever you want your\u00a0\nhair your face your eyes it's not recommended\u00a0\u00a0\nto use on the eye so do it at your own risk\u00a0\nbut I tend to use them on my eyes that is my\u00a0\u00a0\npreferred way of using glitter they have two\u00a0\ndifferent shades at Target I looked at them\u00a0\u00a0\nin store they seem really pretty they also\u00a0\nhave this brown wax that you're supposed to\u00a0\u00a0\nlike there's a little spoolie that you buy and\u00a0\nyou're supposed to use it I should have bought\u00a0\u00a0\nthat one because I really want to try it that\u00a0\none is available as well I didn't try it myself\u00a0\u00a0\nthey also have the blush sticks it's like a cream\u00a0\nblushness thing I didn't love that product last\u00a0\u00a0\ntime I tried it I kind of feel like I need to\u00a0\ngive it another try but as for right now it's\u00a0\u00a0\nnot my favorite product from colourpop I've been\u00a0\ntrying to film this video for the past like three\nhours because they're doing like some\u00a0\nchainsaw action in the background and\u00a0\u00a0\nit is loud and they're just outside my\u00a0\nwindow I used a little bit of this white\u00a0\u00a0\nGraceland that I really really love and I\u00a0\njust want to show you like how opaque it is\nlike that's that's what you can expect\nI just think this is such an amazing product so\u00a0\neven though I'm technically not going to mention\u00a0\u00a0\nthis Graceland as like my top three I would\u00a0\nrecommend if you're looking for a white liner this\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely definitely could be the one because it\u00a0\nis a great product now let's talk about the three\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts that are my favorite that I think that\u00a0\nyou should be looking at if you are looking at\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor Papa Target and again check the link down\u00a0\nbelow if you want to see what else is available\u00a0\u00a0\nthe palette is amazing like these incredible blue\u00a0\neyeshadows for what 14 I cannot recommend this one\u00a0\u00a0\nenough it is absolutely amazing if you want to\u00a0\nadd some blue to your collection definitely this\u00a0\u00a0\nis the route to go I also really like I love the\u00a0\nSuper Shock cheeks they are my absolute favorite\u00a0\u00a0\nformula especially love the shimmery the glowy\u00a0\nones the highlighters definitely cannot recommend\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Super Shock cheeks enough they're an\u00a0\nincredible formula and I am so happy that\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're now available that you can see them both\u00a0\nat Ulta and also at Target and then I really love\u00a0\u00a0\nthe glowing lips I think this is such a wonderful\u00a0\nlip formula and this is probably these and the lip\u00a0\u00a0\noils I would say the lip oils as well let's put\u00a0\nthose together the lip oils and these are some of\u00a0\u00a0\nmy most used lip products outside of YouTube and\u00a0\nI have a really extensive they're going again I\u00a0\u00a0\nhave a really extensive lip collection so for me\u00a0\nto use these like two drugstore products or like\u00a0\u00a0\ncolourpop products outside of YouTube I think that\u00a0\nthat says something now I want to talk about the\u00a0\u00a0\nthree things that I think that you can do better\u00a0\nyou can do better than these at the drugstore and\u00a0\u00a0\nthese are just my personal preferences but the\u00a0\neyeshadow Stakes these aren't good you don't\u00a0\u00a0\nneed to buy these I feel the same about the\u00a0\neye primer this isn't a good eye primer you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan definitely do better than this and I also\u00a0\ndidn't really love this act natural mascara I\u00a0\u00a0\nlike the other one the elongating mascara that was\u00a0\nactually really nice this one it did nothing for\u00a0\u00a0\nmy lashes it's like black water it did nothing\u00a0\nfor my lashes and definitely this was not my\u00a0\u00a0\nfavorite I also will say for my skin type for my\u00a0\nlike skin like how my skin looks I don't love the\u00a0\u00a0\nfresh Pretty fresh or fresh skin that foundation\u00a0\nand also that concealer they're not my favorite\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts they're not the ones that I would\u00a0\nrepurchase and use again at least not how\u00a0\u00a0\nI remember them from before so those are not for\u00a0\nme but I totally understand who they could be for\u00a0\u00a0\nthese products though I'm not 100 who these are\u00a0\nfor I have heard people having this as a favorite\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I honestly it's one of the greatest mysteries\u00a0\nof our time because I really don't think that that\u00a0\u00a0\nis a good product at all but this is the finished\u00a0\nlook I think it looks absolutely incredible and I\u00a0\u00a0\ncannot believe that this eyeshadow look\u00a0\ncame from a such an affordable palette\u00a0\u00a0\nthese are great Blues listen I will die on this\u00a0\nhill these are great Blues I hope you're having\u00a0\u00a0\nan absolutely amazing day don't forget to check\u00a0\nthe description box for more info don't forget\u00a0\u00a0\nto subscribe before you leave and I will\u00a0\nsee you real soon again in a new video bye\n[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]",

Once you figure out what application technique works best for you, the eyeshadow really pays off. And it does last all day heck, even into the next day. When you apply it, keep your eye closed for about 30 seconds or so, that way the shadow will set and not crease when you open and close your eyes. Shadow doesn&#39;t even need touch ups.\ud83d\udcaf",

Was mich definitiv interessieren w\u00fcrde w\u00e4ren gut reflektierende und nicht zu glitzerige Highlighter. Ich war nie ne Highlighter-Person und teste mich da gerade erst durch. Ich wei\u00df, noch, dass du fr\u00fcher Mal so nen dewy wet Stick empfohlen hast, den es nicht mehr gibt. Sowas meine ich. Deine Tipps zu concealern und lipt tints finde ich auch super. Ich suche gerade noch nach sehr haltbaren lip tints, die gut antrocknen aber dennoch dezent sind und lieb\u00e4ugele mit 3ce. Habe aber das Gef\u00fchl, dass ich damit einen Fehler machen w\u00fcrde. Liebe Gr\u00fc\u00dfe",

Diese Dinger sind ja extra so konzipiert, dass sie die Haut reizen und damit die Lippen aufplustern. Ich glaube teilweise ist da auch so Chili, Pfefferminz und sowas drin. Was ist von diesen Produkten zu halten, selbst wenn man sie ganz gut vertr\u00e4gt, schadet die Irritation der Haut evtl. Auf lange Sicht? Spam over.",

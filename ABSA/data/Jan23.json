        "transcript_text": "We still use the sandwich method,\nbut we don\u2019t use liquid foundation.\nBelieve me, I can guarantee that oily skin will not take off makeup for a day. The moment you open\ntheir color palette forever, you feel like you\u2019re on vacation\n. Hello, everyone, I\u2019m Mudi\n. Welcome back to my channel\nand join me in science.\nRational planting of skin care Today\nwe are not talking about skin care, let\u2019s\ntalk about make-up and\nshare my annual love of make-up\n, not just this year. In fact,\nI have used some products for many years\nbecause they are so easy to use.\nI can\u2019t bear to replace them.\nI don\u2019t use liquid foundation.\nYes , but with them,\nyou can still create a flawless base makeup,\nand if you don\u2019t take off your makeup for a day, it\n \nwo n\u2019t make your skin worse. After you remove your makeup, you won\u2019t get some closed mouth,\nacne, even if\nyou wear makeup every day It will get worse.\nLet \u2019s use concealer first to cover up some dark circles. For\nsmall skin blemishes,\nClinique \u2019s Even Better Concealer\nis too moisturizing and light, and\nat the same time it is a medium-to-high concealer , especially under the eyes.\n \nThere are also a lot of skin nourishing ingredients in the\nEven Better series\n. Some essences\nand antioxidant ingredients are added in it,\nso I have never said that it makes my eyes dry , dry lines,\nor dull skin after removing makeup.\nIts design is also quite interesting. There is a sponge head in the\n \nfront .\nIf you touch up makeup outside, you can use it to blend. The color of\nClinique \u2019s foundation is not too white\n, so I choose the whitest number every time.\nThis is WN01 flax, which looks\nlike my face\n. I have a little acne marks, and the acne marks on the\ncheeks can also be covered with it. It\nis a very versatile concealer. We still use the sandwich method for\nbase makeup\n, but we don\u2019t use liquid foundation. Use loose powder and loose powder to superimpose it like this.\nI believe I can guarantee that oily skin will not take off makeup for a day and\nlast for 10 hours. It\u2019s\nnot a problem,\nbecause we\u2019ve already used concealer,\nso I\u2019ll use loose powder to set the eyes first,\nso that it will be smoother when I put on the powder. It\u2019s like\nabsorbing some oil to fill some skin lines\n. Then I use this Catkin card\nTing\u2019s loose powder, I think it\u2019s a complete replacement for NARS. Whether it\u2019s\nbrightening or oil control, there\n\u2019s not much difference\n. It\u2019s been revised and upgraded.\nI think it\u2019s an old version.\nRemember to buy size 02. Transparent white,\ntransparent\ncolor will not change the luster\nand texture of your makeup,\nand transparent loose powder usually\nhas better oil control and lasting power than natural color. I also highly recommend the\npowder puff\n. It is the foundation of Jane Iredale's family,\nmineral foundation The\npowder puff is\nsuper easy to use and super multi-functional.\nI use it to apply loose powder and powder . Any powder products are very docile.\nYou look ordinary. A\nsponge puff is not even a flocking puff . It is a sponge puff, but after applying makeup, you\nThe skin is super clear, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the accumulation of powder, I\ncan evenly spread the powder on the face,\nthis powder puff is so easy to use,\nif you don\u2019t buy any base makeup products today,\ngo buy\na powder puff, it can save your old base makeup,\nforever Changed make up for ever\nMatte Velvet Skin\nthis me I have used\nmany boxes, and the\niron sheet is the best proof. The color\nY225 is more suitable for yellow 1-2 white. In fact, you are not afraid of a slightly darker base makeup,\nbecause we need to use white powder to set the makeup, and\nyour face will naturally brighten.\nI can\u2019t think of a second\nfull concealer powder in my mind. I can\u2019t think of a second\nblemish eraser\n. Once you apply it on all your blemish lines, the\nspots will disappear. The\nonly and only flaw\nI can find out about this powder\nis that its oil control power is not very high\n. So I recommend that you use the sandwich method,\nloose powder and then loose powder\n, so you can put on a layer of your favorite,\nany transparent loose powder.\nI guarantee that it can make his makeup look 10 layers higher\n. Even in summer, oily skin doesn\u2019t\nhave to worry about oil. It is a\npowder product from Physicians Formula. The\nfirst powder I used in college, the\nfull concealer powder, is from their family.\nLater, I bought this blue package and it is\nalso very easy to use\n \n. The silver package is more suitable for dry skin.\nIt can create an almost full-concealer makeup. It is\na substitute for make up for ever. Then this year I used their products,\nsuch as blush and contouring. I love the butter series of Murumuru\nButter in this series . Then\n \nthese color palettes are all limited color palettes.\n \nI bought two kinds of\ntheir palettes. You can buy them without thinking\nbecause it\n\u2019s so worth it.\n \nYou want any one\nof butter blush .\n13 bucks, the whole plate\nis only 15 bucks. The greatest hit is a bronzing palette.\nWow, this\ngrooming is so beautiful, it\nbreaks my dirty impression of yellow grooming. This grooming looks like it was\nsun -baked Bronze blush that\nAsians can also use. This is also very good-looking\nmurumuru butter blush. I use these two to superimpose a very\nhealthy and natural red bean paste color.\nThen this loose powder is not a loose powder\nbut a powder cake.\nIt evens out the skin tone and smoothes the skin, and it has a\nparticularly good effect of reducing pores visually.\nI will put the links of these single ones below .\n \nBuy whichever color you can buy. It\u2019s\nso easy to use. The highlight\ninside is also good. It\u2019s\nvery beautiful.\nI hope I can buy a single one. It\u2019s called tropical sands\n. The Chinese translation is quite dreamy.\nTropical fine sand\n. You open their color plates forever. At\nthat moment, you feel like you\u2019re on vacation.\nOffice workers , busy mothers\n, right?\nTime to sit there and paint an eye makeup\ndelicately\n. Eyeshadow is your best helper\n, especially\nafter using this eyeshadow,\nI don\u2019t want to touch eyeshadow powder anymore.\nRose ink\u2019s two-color\neyeshadow is one eyeshadow and eyeshadow powder . This powder It has sequins. I used it for the first time.\nThen I remember I went to the supermarket. I was praised for the\nfirst time I used it. I was praised\nby a young lady for its beautiful eye makeup.\nI was taken aback. I said, what did\nI use? don't remember me today\nGod, what kind of\nspecial\neye makeup do you use?\nThen I thought it was just an eyeshadow.\nMaybe it\u2019s because of its sequins. It\nmakes your eyes feel three-dimensional. You\nonly used two colors\n, which makes others feel that you have painted a delicate eye makeup.\nEyes are lifted\nBrightness is also very important.\nI have recommended\nBobbi Brown\u2019s golden pink\nmany times. The\nperfect eye socket\nand the brightening of the front 1/3 of\nthe eye can enlarge the eyes all at once.\nAnd people like us who wear contact lenses\nI ca n\u2019t use sequined eye shadows. Every time\nI use sequined eye shadows on the eye area\n, there will always be powder flying into it,\nand if you wear contact lenses, it will be very abrasive\n. So now I basically use all\neye shadows. No need for powder, the color is really beautiful golden pink\nAnd Golden Bronze is also a brown color.\nI like it very much. The eyeshadow\n \nI have been using before using Rose Inc\nis also very good-looking. It is a super\ncheap eyeliner. I have used it for many years and\nbought one after another.\nIt is not waterproof . Let me\nfirst say that if\n \nyour eyes are prone to dizziness like inner double eyeliner, it\nmay not be suitable for it\n, but if you just have a very daily\nwork makeup and you don\u2019t want to look abrupt, if you\nwant to draw a very natural brown eyeliner,\nit is very suitable for\nNYX The eye pencil\nis a very traditional eyeliner. It is cut off\nwith a pencil sharpener.\nBasically, you have to sharpen it twice .\nThe color will be more intense\n, and you can also draw the V at the end of the eye\nwithout being too sharp. I\nforgot to mention the color number.\nIt\u2019s dark brown\n903. It\n\u2019s super beautiful and looks good in everyday life\n. You can also draw inner eyeliner.\nI also like it because it\u2019s an ordinary pen\nso it\u2019s very hard.\nIt \u2019s not the kind that breaks off when you draw it.\nNo need I am worried that when you draw the inner eyeliner, if you accidentally\ndraw it off or the scum falls into the eyes, it\ncan save your unusable mascara. You\nmust use a mascara as a base.\nIt is cheap and easy to use\n, this pink one from UKISS Eyelash primer\nIt is a\nfan-shaped brush and it is\nalso black.\nAfter you apply it, it feels like a\nvery light mascara,\nbut it can keep your curls lasting all day long, and it\nwill not faint or fall off.\nI feel It is\nbetter\nthan the Aidu yarn I used before. It\nmakes your eyelashes distinct. I\ncan feel at ease when I go\nout with it, especially when\n \nI go out to play . The matte lip balm is dry. The\nlip gloss is glossy and bright,\nand it doesn\u2019t dry out the lips. After using\nit for a few months, it feels very good\n. Sephora\u2019s No. 05\n\"Pure Desire Lip Gloss\" ceiling\nis well-deserved. Beautiful pink,\nvery juicy\nmouth pouty, and\na little lip plumping effect\n, a bit cool on the upper lip,\nbut not that kind\n, you know, I used Buxom\n\u2019s super mint before, it\u2019s not\nsuper spicy,\nit\u2019s very clear The cool feeling of this\ncolor is really good . No. 05 is a must- buy\n. It looks good on any of your lipsticks.\nI like it very much. I will use up\nKVD\u2019s double dare lipstick\nsoon. It\u2019s an old net It\u2019s\nred, the best red bean paste color\non my lips. When the two are\nsuperimposed, the\neffect\nis the very\ntemperament\nred bean paste color on my lips. Pat McGrath\n\u2019s lip gloss, which I like very much, is easy to use.\nFlesh 6 was asked in my video The most lip gloss.\nEvery time I use it, I will comment on it\n. What is your lip gloss, Mudi? It has a reddish brown\ntemperament\n, and it has a good covering effect with just one wipe.\nPat McGrath's covering power is very good.\nIt is not the kind that is very sheer\nDivine rose\nis a pink lip gloss with a little shimmer. I often wear\nthis color alone\n. I usually\ntake\nmy children to school\nor usually Going to the supermarket or something, I\nseem to be using this color 80% of the time. Divine Rose\nPat McGrath does not have a cool feeling,\n \nbut it also has the effect of\nplumping the lips . The above is the makeup I can\u2019t leave without.\nSome products may not be easy to find links.\nI will try my best to put them in the information column.\nThank you for watching\n.

I did\u00a0\nget it when it was on 30% discount I think with\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Sephora collection they do a lot of those\u00a0\nwhere like they have the percentage off for\u00a0\u00a0\nall the regular products and then even more for\u00a0\ntheir collection so I've been excited to try it\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause the glossier bubble wrap eye cream is\u00a0\ndiscontinued and that's the one I have but I\u00a0\u00a0\nhaven't run out of it yet I'm gonna use it until\u00a0\nI run out but I will try this sooner than later\u00a0\u00a0\nfor the video I mean it's got that like unscented\u00a0\nsmell you know everything has like some sort of\u00a0\u00a0\nscent the texture it's very creamy I just put\u00a0\nit on my finger and just on my arm right now\u00a0\u00a0\nit's apply AM and PM on clean dry skin gently\u00a0\nPat around eyes and yeah so the test will be\u00a0\u00a0\nwhether it wears nicely underneath concealer and\u00a0\neverything whether there's more or less creasing\u00a0\u00a0\nand honestly over time whether it hydrates and\u00a0\nactually like brightens the under eye I guess\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe the brightening might be more immediate\u00a0\nyeah I will cut to me trying that product now\u00a0\u00a0\non bare skin under my eyes as well as underneath\u00a0\nmakeup as you can tell it is a different day it's\u00a0\u00a0\neven a different setup we rearranged some of the\u00a0\nlighting and stuff in the room so now I have a\u00a0\u00a0\nmoon behind me but I'm going to start by applying\u00a0\nthe Sephora hyaluronic acid brightening eye cream\u00a0\u00a0\nI will admit I've used this a couple of times I\u00a0\nnoticed a few things that were different from the\u00a0\u00a0\nglossier one I was using I did my skincare and\u00a0\neverything this morning it's been a couple hours\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I'm moisturized and all that I just didn't\u00a0\nuse an eye cream and I also put way too much\u00a0\u00a0\nso don't do that but I'm just gonna blend it in\u00a0\nit feels a bit thicker than the glossier one now\u00a0\u00a0\nthe glossier one is also discontinued so it's not\u00a0\nlike I can compare the two and be like Oh one's\u00a0\u00a0\nbetter buy the other one this one seems to I don't\u00a0\nknow if it's like sinking in better or drier than\u00a0\u00a0\nthe glossier one I feel like the glossier one and\u00a0\nthis one provide the same amount of like Sheen or\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat I could guess is like brightening but yeah it\u00a0\nsoaks in and like feels a bit drier and less like\u00a0\u00a0\nslick it look looks a bit brighter looks a little\u00a0\nbit like there's a Sheen there so I do like this\u00a0\u00a0\nso far I mean this is just my first impressions\u00a0\nof the products because I haven't been using them\u00a0\u00a0\nenough to actually know I've used it like once and\u00a0\ndidn't really notice too much of a difference too\u00a0\u00a0\nmuch of creasing but I'm gonna test it out today\u00a0\nas well and like really think about it the next\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct is kind of a new product actually it is\u00a0\nthe super goop glow sunscreen I have been using\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Unseen sunscreen I think I've repurchased it\u00a0\ntwice and it's my favorite sunscreen under makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nit's got like a clear finish to it it's a little\u00a0\nbit kind of like a primer texture and I love it\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I've run out of it and I had heard the glow\u00a0\nscreen was also a great great product so to my\u00a0\u00a0\nhusband's dismay he likes using the Unseen\u00a0\nsunscreen as well I mean he probably could\u00a0\u00a0\nuse this and be fine I don't know how glowy it\u00a0\nis so I'm excited to be trying this one out and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen if it doesn't work out I'll just get the\u00a0\nother one again but I'm gonna open it and see\u00a0\u00a0\nhow glowy it really is I'm just gonna put it on\u00a0\nmy wrist because I I'm already having makeup on\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I will be wearing it soon to give you what it\u00a0\nlooks like on bare skin as well as under makeup\u00a0\u00a0\ntoo I believe it comes in two shades I will also\u00a0\nmention it is 36 dollars and it has an SPF of 40\u00a0\u00a0\nand the shades are golden hour bronze and sunrise\u00a0\nchampagne which is the one I got there's also a\u00a0\u00a0\nvalue size if you want a bigger size this is\u00a0\njust the standard size because I figured I try\u00a0\u00a0\nit out first they also have a mini size if you\u00a0\nreally want to just try it so yeah that is the\u00a0\u00a0\nconsistency it's got a little bit of a tint\u00a0\nto it that's it going on I don't know if it\u00a0\u00a0\nhas the most glow or what I was like anticipating\u00a0\nmaybe more Shimmer to it it's definitely glowier\u00a0\u00a0\nthan the Unseen sunscreen I will cut to the clip\u00a0\nof me using the product on bare skin right now\u00a0\u00a0\nall right now it is time to apply the glow screen\u00a0\nsuper goop sunscreen I put like that much I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nknow maybe I'll need more and it's got a tint I\u00a0\nthink I mentioned that already I don't know how\u00a0\u00a0\nmuch coverage it'll actually give but I'm just\u00a0\ngoing to apply it it has the same smell as the\u00a0\u00a0\nUnseen sunscreen by supergoop while it still has\u00a0\nlike a bit of a sunscreen kind of smell I'm adding\u00a0\u00a0\na little more it's really not overpowering if you\u00a0\nhave any sensitivities to smell it's not perfumed\u00a0\u00a0\nor anything like I'd say it's fragrance free just\u00a0\nthat smell of sunscreen is in there a bit it's not\u00a0\u00a0\noverpowering and it goes away like that's the\u00a0\nnumber one thing that I really love about the\u00a0\u00a0\nsunscreen I hate when you feel sunscreen on\u00a0\nyour face and you can smell it like all day\u00a0\u00a0\nlong so this one I think compared to the Unseen\u00a0\none obviously you can see this one a bit more it\u00a0\u00a0\nis glowy it provides a nice Sheen to the skin\u00a0\nnow the Unseen one is not mattifying but like\u00a0\u00a0\nit is matte I think it soaks in better this one\u00a0\nalmost feels more like you're wearing sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0\nso if you're not into that maybe go for the Unseen\u00a0\none I do love that one but I really enjoy the glow\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I'm getting I'm getting more into having more\u00a0\nglowy makeup so I'm going to like this I think but\u00a0\u00a0\nnow let me just jump into applying the rest of\u00a0\nmy makeup and also continue with the haul just\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't mind that it's not fully Blended I'm right\u00a0\ninto applying my makeup I've applied concealer\u00a0\u00a0\nand some CC cream I wanted to show you it before\u00a0\nI actually set my face with powder so this is just\u00a0\u00a0\nfresh with a CC cream it's the IT Cosmetics one\u00a0\nI also mixed in the Maybelline Dream Urban cover\u00a0\u00a0\nit's full coverage protective makeup I just put\u00a0\na little bit in because the shade match of this\u00a0\u00a0\nis not so good so just trying to use this one up\u00a0\nbecause I'm not a fan of it on its own anyways the\u00a0\u00a0\nconcealer I used is the tarte ultra creamy shape\u00a0\ntape concealer it's not the like regular one it's\u00a0\u00a0\nthe ultra creamy one which I don't like as much\u00a0\nbut I've been using it up this is it no Powder\u00a0\u00a0\napplied I put a little Cream Blush as well but\u00a0\nthat's kind of irrelevant you can kind of see the\u00a0\u00a0\nglow I feel like of the sunscreen underneath but\u00a0\nnot a crazy amount I feel like it is the perfect\u00a0\u00a0\namount and these are my under eyes and I did blend\u00a0\neverything in with a beauty blender that's how\u00a0\u00a0\nI applied it and it doesn't look like it's like\u00a0\nseparating or like doing anything weird with the\u00a0\u00a0\neye cream that I used so that's a plus I'm just\u00a0\ngonna set my face see how it wears for the rest of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe day as well all right I did a quick job with\u00a0\nthe rest of my makeup I did set my face with the\u00a0\u00a0\nMaybelline Fit Me Loose finishing powder I did\u00a0\nthat on my under eyes with my beauty sponge so I\u00a0\u00a0\nlike basically baked it or not even baked it fully\u00a0\nbut just tapped in the powder with a damp Beauty\u00a0\u00a0\nblender and then dusted it with a brush on the\u00a0\nrest of my face my face it isn't like super ultra\u00a0\u00a0\nglowy I feel like maybe just a hint more than\u00a0\nusual with the glow sunscreen so I do like the\u00a0\u00a0\nway my makeup is wearing the makeup on top of the\u00a0\nsunscreen was pretty Flawless like it doesn't look\u00a0\u00a0\nbad at all I don't think the under eyes I think\u00a0\nthey look okay like the number one thing that I\u00a0\u00a0\nneed in an eye cream is to make my eyes not look\u00a0\ndry and crusty because my eyes can get super dry\u00a0\u00a0\nso I think it's doing okay there was a little\u00a0\nbit of creasing but I honestly don't know if\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's even the eye cream because sometimes that\u00a0\nhappens on any other day with no eye cream or with\u00a0\u00a0\nthe glossier one that I really do like and then\u00a0\nsometimes it doesn't so I don't know I didn't do\u00a0\u00a0\nanything different I think the makeup looks good\u00a0\nso I'm I'm happy with the application the next\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct is the Charlotte Tilbury airbrush Flawless\u00a0\nsetting spray party all night stay all day it is\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely well reviewed but I had never heard of\u00a0\nanyone having tried it and loving it at least that\u00a0\u00a0\nI know of I mean I've taken a pause on watching\u00a0\na crap ton of beauty influencers lately maybe\u00a0\u00a0\npeople have raved about this and I just don't\u00a0\nknow but the reviews are pretty good on Sephora\u00a0\u00a0\nso it's got a 4.4 star rating 87% recommend\u00a0\nit it sounded like a product I'd really like\u00a0\u00a0\nnow I had been using the Nyx dewy finish setting\u00a0\nspray which is at a much lower price point and I\u00a0\u00a0\ndid like it but because of the 20% off I figured\u00a0\nlet me try something a bit better and see what\u00a0\u00a0\nI might want to use for my wedding makeup if I\u00a0\nhappen to do my makeup myself which I'm not sure\u00a0\u00a0\nif I'm gonna do or Implement some products that\u00a0\nI know that I love trying this product out for\u00a0\u00a0\nthat specifically but it retails for 36 dollars\u00a0\nUSD and I won't lie to you I've used it just a\u00a0\u00a0\ncouple times because I ran out of my setting spray\u00a0\nI will spray it on my face now because I haven't\u00a0\u00a0\nsprayed it on yet the spray is really good my very\u00a0\nvery first impression is I really like the spray\nnot too clumpy definitely better than the Nyx\u00a0\none maybe not as good as the morphe continuous\u00a0\u00a0\nsetting spray that's one I've used in the past and\u00a0\none that I would have repurchased but I wanted to\u00a0\u00a0\ntry something new I'm pretty sensitive to Smells\u00a0\nusually and while this does have a little bit of\u00a0\u00a0\nlike not a perfumey fragrance smells like\u00a0\nsomething that I can't put my finger on but\u00a0\u00a0\nlike something familiar let me just get a really\u00a0\ngood whiff I don't know like is it a bit fruity\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm not sure if you've used this product tell\u00a0\nme what it smells like in the comments if you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow but the smell is not too overpowering that it\u00a0\nbothers me and I've liked it so far definitely has\u00a0\u00a0\nset my makeup really well I do love the Charlotte\u00a0\nTilbury what is it called the finishing powder\u00a0\u00a0\nI've used that recently and I really love it\u00a0\nso I bet you the combination of that and this\u00a0\u00a0\ncould be magic as well as maybe some of her\u00a0\nother products as well but yeah I definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel the makeup like locking in maybe drying a\u00a0\nbit drying? I don't know that is my face I mean\u00a0\u00a0\nI've been sweating filming in this room all day so\u00a0\nthe makeup's probably not sitting well already so\u00a0\u00a0\nI'll try it again and give you another update\u00a0\non it last but not least is the setting spray\nI love the spray on this and I actually really\u00a0\nlike the scent it's a really nice fragrance and\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm really liking it so far the one thing I\u00a0\nfeel when I do spray it like after it dries\u00a0\u00a0\nit really feels like your face is like locked\u00a0\nin I don't want to say it looks dry but it like\u00a0\u00a0\nfeels a bit dry like it's set not in a bad\u00a0\nway I don't think it feels like it's working\u00a0\u00a0\nand that's a good thing I guess that is all\u00a0\nfor the makeup application and yeah that is\u00a0\u00a0\nit for my mini Sephora haul for 2023. if you\u00a0\ndid like this video don't forget to give it\u00a0\u00a0\na like subscribe if you haven't already\u00a0\nand comment down below what your must try\u00a0\u00a0\nSephora product is whether it's something you\u00a0\nrepurchase multiple times or something you're\u00a0\u00a0\nlooking to buy soon I appreciate you watching\u00a0\nhave a wonderful rest of your week bye [Music]",

        "transcript_text": "hi guys welcome back today I'm going to be trying\u00a0\nout some new things I purchased from the drugstore\u00a0\u00a0\nI didn't buy everything for full face so I'm going\u00a0\nto throw in some other things I've been trying out\u00a0\u00a0\nso before we get started I would love for you to\u00a0\nsubscribe if you haven't already and let's get\u00a0\u00a0\ninto it I got this new headband from kodaly and I\u00a0\nfeel like Louise from Bob's Burgers I don't know\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat to do with these things do I tuck them or\u00a0\ndo I let them fly I'll let them fly I feel like\u00a0\u00a0\nLouise okay so I didn't purchase these but these\u00a0\ncame in at the perfect time these are the elf\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor correctors and this morning I went out for\u00a0\na walk it's super beautiful and wintery outside\u00a0\u00a0\nit looks like a winter wonderland but I didn't\u00a0\ncover my face well enough so I got a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nof wind burn on my cheeks here and I also have\u00a0\nsome other healing acne scars and my under eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nthat we can test these out on so these are fun and\u00a0\ncolor correcting can seem intimidating I remember\u00a0\u00a0\nI felt super intimidated by it when I was learning\u00a0\nall about makeup but the easiest way to know which\u00a0\u00a0\none you need is by looking at a color wheel so if\u00a0\nyou have dark under eyes that lean a bit blue or\u00a0\u00a0\ngreen you can use an orangey color corrector like\u00a0\nthese the orange one is best for deeper skin tones\u00a0\u00a0\nand the peachy one is best for lighter skin tones\u00a0\nand they'll help to correct the discoloration\u00a0\u00a0\nunder your eyes you can also use the orange one\u00a0\nfor brow covers as well as to color correct like\u00a0\u00a0\na beard Shadow because beard Shadows often lean\u00a0\na bit more blue so this will help to balance it\u00a0\u00a0\nout and cancel out that color and if you have\u00a0\nsome healing acne scars or your under eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nare leaning more purple a yellow one will help to\u00a0\nbrighten that up and neutralize that discoloration\u00a0\u00a0\ngreen is awesome at color correcting redness so\u00a0\nthis is what I'm going to be using on my little\u00a0\u00a0\ncheekies here and I wish there was a purple in\u00a0\nhere as well because that helps to brighten up\u00a0\u00a0\nyour skin especially if you have some dullness\u00a0\nbut I'm going to be trying out the peachy one\u00a0\u00a0\nfor under my eyes the other one for my acne scars\u00a0\nand the green for the redness and you don't want\u00a0\u00a0\nthese to be full coverage you just want it to be\u00a0\nsheer enough to kind of correct that spot and then\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can add your foundation or whatever and it's\u00a0\nnot going to shine through what you have going on\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm going to take a bit of the green on the\u00a0\nback of my hand because this seems to be quite\u00a0\u00a0\npigmented for a green color corrector and I'm just\u00a0\ngoing to take the tiniest amount and I'm going to\u00a0\u00a0\nlightly dab on my wind burn here and you can\u00a0\nsee already how effective that is and this seems\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a really nice formula it has a very thin\u00a0\nconsistency I did try out a few of them the other\u00a0\u00a0\nday so this isn't my first time using them I found\u00a0\nwhen I directly applied it I'll show you like that\u00a0\u00a0\nto a red spot it applied way too much and it\u00a0\nlooked too vibrant so going off of a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\non your hand is much better because that's going\u00a0\nto shine through foundation and I'm going to do\u00a0\u00a0\nthe same thing now with the yellow because I have\u00a0\nthis healing acne spot right here that leans a bit\u00a0\u00a0\npurple so I'm doing the exact same thing taking\u00a0\na little bit on the back of my hand thank you\nI'm blending that away and now I'm taking the\u00a0\npeachy one and I'm going to apply that same\u00a0\u00a0\ntechnique applying some on the back of my hand\u00a0\nand taking my finger and you can see I have kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof like this purpley bluish tone right here but\u00a0\nnot in my inner corner I'm just going to apply it\u00a0\u00a0\nwhere it's needed you don't want to add too much\u00a0\nof this because then you're going to be going in\u00a0\u00a0\nwith so much more concealer or Foundation than\u00a0\nyou actually need you want this to make your\u00a0\u00a0\nlife easier so you don't have to go in with too\u00a0\nmuch okay I went more in depth with the color\u00a0\u00a0\ncorrecting tutorial than I intended but now let's\u00a0\nmove on so I picked up the Nyx blur blurring tint\u00a0\u00a0\nFoundation I picked up the shade zero five vanilla\u00a0\nhopefully this is going to match because it looks\u00a0\u00a0\na little orange but hey that's okay maybe I can\u00a0\nmix in a little bit of the blue to counteract\u00a0\u00a0\nthat okay it's gonna be good and I really like\u00a0\nhow these two products look together super\u00a0\u00a0\nsuper cute and I'm going to use my BK beauty\u00a0\n101 brush to apply and important when you're\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing over the areas you color corrected you want\u00a0\nto bounce your brush you don't want to swipe it\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause that's just going to move that product\u00a0\naround and your hard work is going to be useless\nthis feels a little bit dry maybe I'm not\u00a0\nreally loving this immediately [Applause]\u00a0\u00a0\num I feel like it's very texture enhancing\u00a0\nalthough I think it's supposed to be the\u00a0\u00a0\nopposite so I'm just going to go over with a\u00a0\nsponge maybe I apply too much I feel like my\u00a0\u00a0\ntexture looks exaggerated there's some dry patches\u00a0\nit's catching on right in the center of my brow\u00a0\u00a0\nhere which I wasn't aware of and my pore is\u00a0\nin the center of my cheeks right here look\u00a0\u00a0\nreally enhanced hopefully you can see here I feel\u00a0\nlike it's making my skin look very dull we'll see\u00a0\u00a0\nhow that sets in but if it continues looking like\u00a0\nthis I know I'm not going to be reaching for it\u00a0\u00a0\nso now for my concealer I picked up the essence\u00a0\nkeep me covered concealer and I grabbed the shade\u00a0\u00a0\num warm shell this one says it has\u00a0\nbuildable medium coverage so let's\u00a0\u00a0\nsee I'm just going to start off with a little\u00a0\nand I'm going to blend that in with my sponge\nthat one looks quite promising it Blended\u00a0\nin really nicely no issues whatsoever my\u00a0\u00a0\nunder eyes look nicely corrected it's not\u00a0\na very blurring formula it just makes my\u00a0\u00a0\nunder eyes look good and a little bit of it\u00a0\nwent a long way especially since I had that\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor corrector it did its job really\u00a0\nnicely I'm going to see how it builds\nyeah and it builds up really nicely it's\u00a0\nquite flattering I dig it now I'm going\u00a0\u00a0\nto take a nice fluffy brush with my elf\u00a0\nPrime and stay powder set my under eyes\nto bronze and Contour I'm going to do\u00a0\nthis Duo again I really like the time\u00a0\u00a0\nI used this combo so I'm taking\u00a0\nit the elf luminous putty bronzer\u00a0\u00a0\nin the shade vacay mood and this is kind\u00a0\nof like a more Contour color for my skin\u00a0\u00a0\ntone and I'm just going to put some in\u00a0\nthe hollow of my cheek blending upwards\u00a0\u00a0\nfor a lifted effect speaking of vacay mood I'm\u00a0\ngoing to be going on vacation from February\u00a0\u00a0\n1st to the 13th so please let me know what you\u00a0\nwould like to see because I have to pre-film I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink six videos so let me know I actually might\u00a0\nhave to pre-film even more than that now because\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause right before I started filming I got an\u00a0\nemail inviting me to my first brand trip so that\u00a0\u00a0\nmight be happening I don't know for sure yet but\u00a0\nyeah every video recommendation leave them in the\u00a0\u00a0\ncomments so now I'm taking my Revolution ibrite\u00a0\nconcealer in the shade deep caramel and with this\u00a0\u00a0\nI like to work in sections because I don't want it\u00a0\nto dry down so quickly because then it's hard to\u00a0\u00a0\nblend it out yeah I'm not sure I'm liking the\u00a0\nNYX Foundation I feel like products are going on\u00a0\u00a0\ntop of it a little bit oddly and I'm just really\u00a0\naware that I have some dry patches all of a sudden\u00a0\u00a0\num and I started off with a very hydrated base\u00a0\nfrom my skincare it seems to have sucked all of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe moisture from my skin and made it evaporate\u00a0\nI don't know how it did it it is kind of weird\u00a0\u00a0\nthough like I do look diffused like my skin looks\u00a0\nblurred but at the same time enhanced I don't know\u00a0\u00a0\nwith the science of that is what like I don't\u00a0\nknow how that's happening this is not applying\u00a0\u00a0\nthe same way that I know so while I was roaming\u00a0\naround and looking at the new things I spotted\u00a0\u00a0\na bright light in pink so I wanted to see what\u00a0\nit looked like compared to the Charlotte Tilbury\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one looks like it might be a little cooler\u00a0\nbut I wanted to see anyways but before I do that\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm going to highlight with the bright light in\u00a0\nstrobe champagne oh also I wanted to tell you\u00a0\u00a0\nguys this because I thought it was so funny\u00a0\nthe other day I got a really cute comment\u00a0\u00a0\nabout my teeth they're like I really like\u00a0\nyour teeth don't ever change them and I really\u00a0\u00a0\nappreciate that I don't have any plans on changing\u00a0\nmy teeth but something did because that night\u00a0\u00a0\nlike probably half an hour\u00a0\nafter reading that comment\u00a0\u00a0\nI chipped my front tooth I don't know if you\u00a0\nnoticed but it's like a little rounded it's\u00a0\u00a0\nnot a square I don't know how I chipped my tooth\u00a0\nI was just watching TV and I ran my tongue over my\u00a0\u00a0\nteeth and I was like hmm that feels a little\u00a0\ndifferent freaking chipped it have no idea\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat I did the only reasonable explanation I have\u00a0\nis maybe I like chipped it on my water bottle\u00a0\u00a0\nbut even so I don't think I did I feel like I'd\u00a0\nremember the Bonk feels weird I don't like it\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I'm getting it fixed tomorrow but I just\u00a0\nthought it was so ironic that happened yeah\u00a0\u00a0\nthat highlighter really stuck down differently\u00a0\nthan usual I don't know I feel like my skin\u00a0\u00a0\nlooks patchy this is not going the way I wanted\u00a0\nbut let's see if this is a good dupe or not oh\u00a0\u00a0\nthis might be a lot more pink not bad though the\u00a0\nCharlotte Tilbury one is definitely more peachy\u00a0\u00a0\nin tone but like the shine is very similar this is\u00a0\nthe revolution one and this is Charlotte Tilbury\u00a0\u00a0\nso the Finish is very very similar if anything\u00a0\nthis one looks more glossy whereas this one's\u00a0\u00a0\nmore shimmery I'm kind of happy that it's a\u00a0\ndifferent tone fits in my collection better\u00a0\u00a0\nthat way so since it's applying weirdly with\u00a0\nthe sponge tip like how the highlighter went on\u00a0\u00a0\nand the bronzer I'm just going to take some in the\u00a0\npalm of my hand and I'm using my quo Beauty angled\u00a0\u00a0\nfoundation brush and I'm going to apply it this\u00a0\nway because I feared that by applying a couple\u00a0\u00a0\ndots with the sponge tip that it would just sink\u00a0\nright in to the foundation and get stuck so this\u00a0\u00a0\nway I'm not going to give it the opportunity to\u00a0\ndo so I'm not sure I like that tone of pink just\u00a0\u00a0\non its own I don't think it looks very smooth\u00a0\non my skin either um so I'm just going to take\u00a0\u00a0\nsome of my setting spray to hopefully kind\u00a0\nof rehydrate things and maybe that will help\nnow that that setting spray has set I'm\u00a0\njust going to add some setting powder\u00a0\u00a0\nto the center of my face and I'm using\u00a0\nthe elf one again same with my under eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nand I think I'm going to add a powder blush on top\u00a0\nof this just to make things look softer because\u00a0\u00a0\nit's looking really not great I know I'm probably\u00a0\ngoing to get comments wishing I had washed off the\u00a0\u00a0\nNyx product but I wanted to give it the benefit of\u00a0\nthe doubt to see if it was going to sink in nicely\u00a0\u00a0\nor what and I wanted to see how it worked with\u00a0\nother products and now that I've seen it I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it and it's also good for you guys to see so\u00a0\nI'm just going to add a pink blush on top of this\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is not one from the drugstore but I just\u00a0\nneeded to even that out it was bugging me\nand the blush I used just in case if you're\u00a0\ncurious was the M Cosmetics Heavens glow\u00a0\u00a0\nradiant Veil blush in the shade cherub and\u00a0\nI'm also going to use a powder bronzer to\u00a0\u00a0\nsmooth things out this is the L'Oreal\u00a0\nsoft matte bronzer in the shade 300.\nbut now it's time for the brow\u00a0\nintermission so please enjoy\nI want to do a light eye I feel like I've been\u00a0\ndoing a lot of bigger eye looks but I'm just\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to use my elf no budge cream eyeshadows\u00a0\none in the shade plateau and the other in Sand\u00a0\u00a0\nDune I'm starting off with sand dune with this\u00a0\nflat little detail brush from colourpop it's the\u00a0\u00a0\ne29 I'm just taking a small amount of that and\u00a0\nI'm just going to enhance my lash line foreign\nmore in the center of my lashes and then I'm\u00a0\npulling inwards as I get to the outskirts of\u00a0\u00a0\nmy outer corner I didn't want to take this too\u00a0\nfar out I wanted it just on my lash line like so\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'm doing the same thing with the darker\u00a0\none just gently tapping directly in the pot\nand doing the same thing usually I\u00a0\nflick outwards but with this look\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm flicking inwards because\u00a0\nthis is just to enhance and\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm going to take Sand Dune again just\u00a0\nto enhance my lower lash line a touch\nI'm taking a bit of my highlighter I'm just going\u00a0\u00a0\nto put some in the palm of my hand I\u00a0\nwanted to enhance the glow of my lid\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm just taking a tiny amount with my fingertip\u00a0\nand I'm drawing it up from the center of my eye\nand for my mascara I'm going to be using my\u00a0\nelf big mood mascara in the shade deep Brown\u00a0\u00a0\nI wanted to give you guys a little update\u00a0\nabout the elf lash and roll I really like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe effect and how it builds it's really\u00a0\npretty but it does crumble not a lot but\u00a0\u00a0\nit crumbles like near the end of the day\u00a0\nI'll have a few flecks of mascara under my\u00a0\u00a0\neyes they don't smudge thankfully they're easy\u00a0\nto like flick away but just wanted to let you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow it is a little crumbly so that's\u00a0\nwhy I'm opting for the Deep brown one\nand there's my quick little simple but flattering\u00a0\neye look now let's move on to lips and I didn't\u00a0\u00a0\npick up any lip liners but I picked up one\u00a0\nof the last NYX fat oils this one's clear\u00a0\u00a0\nUnfortunately they do have a few other Shades\u00a0\nthat look stunning but my local place only had\u00a0\u00a0\nthe clear one so I'm going to try out the formula\u00a0\nand go on a hunt for the tinted ones if I like it\u00a0\u00a0\num so I'm going to line my lips with\u00a0\none of these I don't know which one\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is M Cosmetics bunny which\u00a0\nis a bit peachy maybe and the other\u00a0\u00a0\none is makeup forever boundless Berry\u00a0\nI think boundless Berry works better\nforeign\nmore of a diffused lip line I'm taking an\u00a0\neyeshadow brush I'm just going to sweep across\u00a0\u00a0\nthat line I created and since this is a clear lip\u00a0\noil I'm diffusing this into the center of my lip\u00a0\u00a0\njust so that there's no line of demarcation or\u00a0\nlike an obvious lip line the packaging super cute\u00a0\u00a0\nI love the lime green and the applicator kind of\u00a0\nlooks like the Dior one I'll whip it out let's see\u00a0\u00a0\nidentical I almost put that applicator right\u00a0\ninto here that would have not been very good\noh it feels more lacquery than some other lip oils\u00a0\u00a0\nit feels a lot like the Dior one it has\u00a0\nthat resistance when you're applying it\u00a0\u00a0\nbut it doesn't feel sticky or resistant feeling\u00a0\non your actual lips I like to do that a bunch\u00a0\u00a0\nof times with new glosses or lip oils to see\u00a0\nif it creates any of those gross gloopy lines\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I think this one passes the test that's nice I\u00a0\ndo like this texture the smell is a little strong\u00a0\u00a0\nhopefully that dissipates it smells like\u00a0\nsomething from my childhood it smells like\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe oh what is that it smells like maybe a hubba\u00a0\nbubba gum flavor or kind of citrusy watermelony\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat is that but here is the look um there's\u00a0\nqualities I dislike in qualities that I really\u00a0\u00a0\nenjoy I think I saved it with the layers\u00a0\nof powder and setting spray and such\u00a0\u00a0\num but yeah that Foundation I think is a no-go\u00a0\nfor me I'm willing to try it out again but I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nhave the utmost confidence in that product I'm\u00a0\nhappy I layered on things I've tried before to see\u00a0\u00a0\nhow drastic of a difference the application was\u00a0\nlike the application of the Revolution concealers\u00a0\u00a0\nand bright lights was awful I really did not like\u00a0\nworking with these on top of that foundation and\u00a0\u00a0\nI just feel like things are sitting weird it\u00a0\njust feels dry I brought you in as close as\u00a0\u00a0\nI can but hopefully you can see like my forehead\u00a0\ndoes not look great like especially in this area\u00a0\u00a0\nright here there's some areas it's clinging to but\u00a0\nit's looking a lot better but I had to layer like\u00a0\u00a0\nso many different products to make it look good\u00a0\nwhich I don't have to do with other foundations so\u00a0\u00a0\nif it came between this and another Foundation\u00a0\nI'd probably grab the other Foundation super\u00a0\u00a0\ncute packaging though but the actual formula is a\u00a0\nno-go for me but moving away from that Foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nI really enjoyed the elf color correctors they\u00a0\nwere very effective they did their job I like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe formula of them as well they're super seamless\u00a0\nlike I feel like they'll blend into many of your\u00a0\u00a0\nroutines really easily I don't think this is\u00a0\na product that I'm going to implement into my\u00a0\u00a0\neveryday routine I think I'll gravitate towards\u00a0\nthese when I want a more perfected base or if\u00a0\u00a0\nI had no sleep it was very effective under my\u00a0\neyes speaking of my under eyes I actually really\u00a0\u00a0\nenjoyed this concealer I feel like I will be using\u00a0\nthis quite a bit the formula was really nice easy\u00a0\u00a0\nto use I really liked its buildable coverage it\u00a0\nwas it was just simple and seamless to work with\u00a0\u00a0\nso thumbs up for this one and now that I've had a\u00a0\nchance to talk with this lip oil on I really enjoy\u00a0\u00a0\nit I'm going to go on the hunt for other colors\u00a0\nI need to see what the tinted versions look like\u00a0\u00a0\nreally cute it feels really nice it feels very\u00a0\nvery similar to the texture of the Dior ones\u00a0\u00a0\nand the gloss is so pretty every time I look at my\u00a0\nmonitor here I just look at my and lastly for the\u00a0\u00a0\nblush from Revolution I'm going to have to give\u00a0\nthis another shot with a different Foundation it\u00a0\u00a0\napplied weird on top of that like the other ones I\u00a0\nfeel like this video was a bit of a roller coaster\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I appreciate you coming along with me I really\u00a0\nhope you enjoyed it even with a couple hiccups if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou did make sure to give this video a like I\u00a0\nwill link everything I used in the description\u00a0\u00a0\ndown below so feel free to check that out and\u00a0\nI'll see you in the next one bye guys [Music]\nthank you foreign\n[Music]",

        "transcript_text": "Today, I'm going to teach you how to get\nplastic surgery\nwithout the surgery part.\nThese simple makeup tips and tricks will\nhave you looking\nyour absolute best\nin the most powerful phase\nof your female life,\nwhich is age 50 and beyond.\nIf you're new here,\nmy name is Gabi and welcome to my channel.\nI've been a makeup artist and hairstylist\nfor over 17 years,\nworking with thousands of different women\nof all different ages.\nMy channel is all about empowering you\nto feel your best and never\nabout shaming you or encouraging you\nto repeatedly fight against aging\nor fight against your beauty insecurities,\nwhatever that may be.\nI'm going to have an honest moment\nwith you and tell you that I hate\ntitling my videos with the word \u201cyounger\u201d\nbecause that really is not what\nthis is about.\nA woman's worth\ndoes not diminish with her age.\nYou are not invisible after 50.\nI see you.\nIn fact, you're just getting started.\nI feel like I need to say that\nright off the bat because I'm\nso against using the keyword younger.\nBut I know that's what\npeople are searching for and clicking on.\nAnd I want you to find this video\nso I can help you feel better after 50.\nToday, I want to show you some of the common\nmakeup mistakes\nthat I see my mature clients making.\nAnd then I want to show you\nhow to adjust a few simple things\nto just make it\na lot more flattering for you.\nLet's go!\nThe first mistake that I often\nsee mature women make with their beauty\nroutine is ignoring their skincare\nand then going in with very dry\nmakeup products.\nIn my opinion,\nNo one over the age of 50\nshould be using a powder foundation.\nAs we age,\nour skin loses luminosity and hydration.\nIf you want youthful looking skin,\nyou really do\nneed to have like a radiance\nor a glow to it.\nA powder foundation not only sits\nin the preexisting fine lines\nand wrinkles, making them look a deeper,\nbut it also flattens the skin out\nand makes everyone just look a lot\nless healthy in general.\nThis is how we're going to correct that.\nThe first thing we want to do in\nour routine is take the necessary steps\nto enhance our glow.\nExfoliating once or twice a week\nis one of the most important things\nthat we can do to achieve that radiance.\nThis is my beautiful\n50 plus year old model,\nAngie, who came into the studio\nto help us out today. In the comments,\nlet me know what you guys think\nis Angie's most beautiful feature\nand what you would play up\nif you were the one doing her makeup.\nIt takes a lot of courage to strip\neverything off and expose yourself\nto hundreds of thousands of people.\nSo it's really important to me\nthat our models feel supported.\nIn the comments section.\nOn Angie,\nI started off by applying an AHA+PHA Exfoliating mask.\nThis is a chemical exfoliant\nso it doesn't have granules\nlike the typical facial exfoliators\nthat we think about do.\nThis sits on top of the skin\nand exfoliates chemically,\nand it does a great job of it.\nOnce that was on and doing its job,\nI applied some hydrogel under eyemasks to hydrate.\nAny fine lines in the delicate eye area.\nIf you have issues under the eyes,\nit's very, very normal.\nThese types of under eye mask\nwhich sit on top of the skin,\ncan really help to wake up that area\nbefore makeup application.\nThe one that I used here was the one that\nwas targeted towards minimizing wrinkles.\nI will leave a list of everything\nused in the description box below.\nSo if you're curious,\njust go check the description box.\nIt will be there, I promise.\nWhile that was sitting on the skin,\nI washed Angie's hair and prepped it\nwith a leave in conditioner and a serum.\nWe'll tackle that a little bit later.\nThe next step was to apply a hydrating\nmoisturizer and sunscreen as a skin prep.\nOnce that absorbed into the skin\nand the skin was looking\nnice and supple, I applied the Charlotte\nTilbury Wonder Glow Primer.\nThis primer is beautiful under foundations\nbecause it has a natural\nglow and luminosity to it\nthat is not sparkly.\nOn top of that,\nI use the IT Cosmetics CC cream as my base.\nInstead of reaching for Powder Foundation\nHigh Coverage\nFoundation, Matte Foundation,\nfind something for you.\nIt doesn't have to be It Cosmetics,\nbut whatever you like,\nthat is soft and luminous instead.\nThis is literally the best piece of advice\nthat I can give you.\nEven if you follow\nno other tip in this video,\nyou will already look ten years younger\njust by doing proper skin\nprep and using the proper face makeup.\nInfusing radiance really is the absolute\nkey in mature makeup application.\nThe next mistake that I often see\nwomen make is attempting to correct\ndarkness under the eyes with concealer\nthat is too light.\nThis does one of two things.\nIt will either create an ashy cast\nwhich is extremely unflattering\nand make you look sickly,\nor it will give you this reverse\nraccoon effect where the skin around\nthe eyes looks too white.\nThis type of lightness around the eyes\njust enhances any lines and wrinkles\nthat you may already have\nand doesn't actually correct anything.\nIf you then add powder foundation on top\nto set the concealer,\nyou get this really dry,\ncreepy wrinkly situation going on.\nNo, no, let's not do that.\nWe're not going to do that anymore.\nThe way to brighten under the eyes\nwithout this happening\nis to use a color corrector.\nIf you have blue pigmentation\nunder the eyes,\nyou need an orange\nor a peach based corrector,\nbecause orange and blue are opposite\non the color wheel.\nSo they neutralize the tone out.\nI am using the Mac Prep and Prime Color\nCorrector with the warmth of my fingertip\nto stipple it on top of the areas\nwhere I see any blue tones.\nAfter that I go in with the concealer\nthat is the correct shade\nand I stipple it\nlightly over top of the corrector.\nThen you can use the tiniest amount\nof translucent powder to set it\nso it doesn't crease.\nNow here is a stab that I often see\ngetting missed.\nIt is absolutely essential that you prime\nand even out your eyelids\nwith the concealer and a bit of powder.\nYou don't need any fancy products.\nAll you have to do\nis use the same concealer on the lids\nthat you used under the eyes,\neven out the area, and set it\nwith a powder before you apply eyeshadow.\nThis keeps the shadow looking\nabsolutely perfect, allows it to blend\nseamlessly and also keeps the oils\non the lid from creasing your shadow.\nNow I know what you're about to say.\n\u201cWhat about Eyelid Primers, Gabi?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think of those?\u201d\nI never ever use lid primers.\nI personally feel like\nthey are a complete waste of money.\nA concealer and a translucent powder\nworked perfectly for me every single time,\nand I've been a makeup artist\nfor 17 years.\nMistake number three is applying the wrong\neyeshadow color on the wrong spots.\nI saw a video of Tara Reid on Tik Tok,\nwho is actually only 47,\nand it was really the perfect example\nof what not to do.\nIf you look at Tara Reid\nand then you look at Jennifer\nAniston, who's 53, you can see where\nthe placement issues are.\nNotice how much fresher Jennifer looks.\nOkay. Here is the big mistake\nTara Reid made.\nIf you put dark eyeshadow on the entire\nlid and light eyeshadow on the crease,\nthe lid will become smaller\nlooking and sink in.\nAnd the crease\nwhere you have the most sagging here\nwill come forward and look saggier.\nThen if you put black eyeliner\nall the way to the end of the lash line\nfollowing the lash line,\nyou're going to get this sinking down\neffect on the side of the eyes,\nmaking them look droopier.\nIf you then add a heavy strip lash\nthat is not well fitted to the eye.\nThe end result is smaller,\nsaggier, wrinklier looking eyes.\nYou combine that with the drying\nfoundation mistake and it's a hot mess.\nIt's really bad.\nIt looks really, really bad.\nThis is how we're going to fix it.\nSo after applying that concealer\nand powder\nto prep the lid, like I mentioned before,\nyou're going to use windshield\nwiper motions to apply a medium\nmatte shadow to the crease area.\nIf there's any sagging in this area, it's\ngoing to immediately recede\nand minimize it.\nThen on the lid, you're going to use\neither your fingers or a brush\nto brighten that up, making the eyes\nlook much bigger.\nMakeup is all about playing with\nthe illusions of light and dark, right?\nHighlight and contour.\nSo light draws attention and makes\nthings come forward.\nSo if you want your eyes to look bigger,\nyou need to make them brighter\nand lighter in the lid.\nDark recedes and hides things.\nSo if you have like a looser crease,\nadding a darker matte\nshadow will draw it into the shadows\nand make it look less noticeable.\nHere is another trick for you\nif you want to give yourself a mini\neyelift using eyeshadow and a small packed\nbrush,\nfollow the lash line, but instead of\nfollowing it to the end of the lashes\nbefore you get there,\ntilt your brush up and blend that out.\nThis will lift\nthe corner of your eyes upwards.\nThis is so easy to do\nbecause you're using eyeshadow.\nIt's very easy to blend in.\nIt's not nearly as harsh\nor difficult to control as eyeliner.\nThen to really maximize\nthe lift in the eyes, you can use a lash\ncurler then a lash primer.\nThen mascara.\nThe lash primer will bulk up the lashes\nand make them look a lot\nthicker, fuller, and hence more youthful.\nThe fourth mistake I often\nsee made involves lips: using no lipstick\nor lipstick that is too nude,\ntoo matte, or too dark is a big no no.\nA youthful mouth is plump and supple, and\nas we age, our lips naturally thin out.\nSo we need to use lipstick\nto recreate that illusion of fullness.\nIf you look at Angie here with matte lips\nversus here with a soft\nbut still more pronounced moist lip,\nyou will notice\nhow the second lip\nis significantly more flattering overall.\nWe have to keep thinking about\nthe play of light and dark in makeup.\nIf I chose a really dark matte shade\nfor her, it would make her lips recede\nand look smaller,\njust like it did for her eyes.\nIf I do a nude matte lip,\nit washes her out.\nSo in order to enhance that glow in her\nface, I needed to add a lighter color\nwith some vibrancy\nand some hydration to her lips.\nMistake number five is applying a powder\nblush too low on the face.\nIf you apply a blush too low, you collapse\nthe face and make it look sallow.\nSo try doing this instead.\nTry replacing your powder blush\nfor a cream blush with a peachy pinky tone\nand place it on top of the apples\nof the cheeks moving up the cheekbone.\nIf you want a little extra radiance,\nyou can also use a highlighter stick\nand stipple it on top of the cream blush\nusing your fingertips.\nAfter her hair and makeup was done,\nof course, I went in\nand I did a beautiful blow out\nwith some of the soft curls\nbecause we all know what an enormous\ndifference a beautiful head of hair makes.\nAnd this is our finished result.\nThis is what Angie looked like\nwhen she came into the studio.\nThis is what she look like\nafter a lot of makeup mistakes.\nAnd this is what you look like\nwith the corrections applied.\nShe is beautiful. She is radiant.\nShe is an absolute queen.\nThe best part is that this makeup\ndoes not wear her.\nIt just enhances what she already has.\nNow, if you embrace her natural hair\nor want to embrace it like Angie does,\nthen you should check out my video\non the five tips that will have you loving\nyour gray hair\nnext because this one's over.",

I use most of these techniques in my beauty routine and it&#39;s very hard to adjust to at first because when I was younger I used a cat eyeliner look which looks horrible now.  Thank you for doing these videos.  I&#39;m 62 and although I embrace my age I feel beautiful with a touch of makeup.",

I think a full face of your holy grail drugstore products would be fun too! Or another one of the bracket tournament videos you just did with a different product like foundation or something!",

In this video, I'll be unboxing the latest and greatest from Fenty Skin, Cay Skin, and Sephora. From cleansers to moisturizers, I'll be giving you an in-depth look at each product and sharing my honest thoughts and experiences. Whether you're a skincare beginner or a seasoned pro, you won't want to miss this video! So grab a snack, sit back, and let's dive into the world of skincare together.\n\nThese products are great for anyone who suffers from dry skin, and are looking for ways to hydrate their skin. Sometimes, we focus a lot on exfoliating and cleansing our skin, which is great, however it can leave our skin very dry, so we must add the hydration back into our skin. I will show you how it looks on my skin too, does it have a shine and glow to it, how it feels and smells.\n\n#fentyskin #skincarehaul  #fentyskinreview #cayskinunboxing #sephoraskincare #beautyhaul #skincareaddict #skincareobsessed  #skincaretips #skincarereview \n\n\nSubscribe Here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8zY3Eqv-dSYVnQXmo8AexQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 Download the app \u2935\ufe0f\nhttps://share.stationhead.com/OVJuAavxODD\n\nWebsite - https://carlottascorner.com/ \n\nFollow me on Social Media: \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/carlottascorner/\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/iamcarlottascorner/\n\nRecommended Playlists: \n\nEntertainment Tea - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5dzUDR9Uck&list=PLt0Kxm087MZu7ToCfAQ\n\nCarlotta's Corner: The Vlog - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_VzvxJQmLU&list=PLt0Kxm087MZuEM-8xFxzz_-wPoiLA3X0M\n\nCorner Conversations - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNCEkv1A4Og&list=PLt0Kxm087MZupJ3SlPExdrkBwbIAa6E4p\n\nListening Lounge - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws4LLDolFdE&list=PLt0Kxm087MZsePrAm1DiCnq3hTSkshKAy",

I recently cut bangs to hide the furrow lines.  Brighter lipsticks balance the silver hair, subtle eye shadows because I wear glasses.  I started taking 50+ vitamins going through perimenopause, and now I&#39;m over that hill.  I&#39;ve never had as many compliments on my hair, the &quot;color&quot;, the cut, and my complexion as I&#39;ve had the last three dye free years. Nature really does give us the color we&#39;re supposed to have. I&#39;ve gone to a single, soft shimmer just on my lids as they&#39;re hooded, simple smoked eyeliner, and it works. The shimmer gives a brightness behind my glasses. I still use Double Wear and still get compliments. Basically, we need to do what works for us.  This works for me. I&#39;m still glam, just older and more sparkly.",

There is much power in good physical and mental health that translates through our physical attributes - my skin has never looked better by reducing processed sugar and carbs, increased hydration and physical movement. I have always adored make-up and enjoy watching your videos for new ideas xx",

I found that none of the ones I used have enough coverage: after couple hours my face is red again. Or maybe it will be possible to make a video about proper makeup for us - young ladies at heart \u263a - who suffer from Rosacea? Thank you in advance.",

I recently cut bangs to hide the furrow lines.  Brighter lipsticks balance the silver hair, subtle eye shadows because I wear glasses.  I started taking 50+ vitamins going through perimenopause, and now I&#39;m over that hill.  I&#39;ve never had as many compliments on my hair, the &quot;color&quot;, the cut, and my complexion as I&#39;ve had the last three dye free years. Nature really does give us the color we&#39;re supposed to have. I&#39;ve gone to a single, soft shimmer just on my lids as they&#39;re hooded, simple smoked eyeliner, and it works. The shimmer gives a brightness behind my glasses. I still use Double Wear and still get compliments. Basically, we need to do what works for us.  This works for me. I&#39;m still glam, just older and more sparkly.",

I found that none of the ones I used have enough coverage: after couple hours my face is red again. Or maybe it will be possible to make a video about proper makeup for us - young ladies at heart \u263a - who suffer from Rosacea? Thank you in advance.",

        "transcript_text": "I can bet anything that every woman wants to look great, chic, with full\nmake-up, with full marathon, and just like from the cover of a magazine. I made this video for those women who\nare far from the world of beauty, cosmetics, visage. But after all, every woman, as I said,\nwants to look attractive, presentable, feel chic. Therefore,\ntoday I have prepared a basic set of cosmetics and accessories that will help you make a basic business make-up.\nAnd to this make-up in the evening, you can bring your lips with red lipstick. And you already have an evening bow,\nwhat else could be better. Here we go! Of course, now I am smarter and more\naware of the application steps of all products. So I want to start from the base.\nActually, I read a lot of useful reviews and decided to buy a base from Bobby Brown. Most likely you\nhave already seen it somewhere - this is the most popular base. This is how it looks. In fact, friends,\nwhat is this base? It's basically a cream. What is this base for? It serves to\nmoisturize and nourish your face as much as possible. Because moisturizing is considered one of\nthe most important steps in applying your makeup, of course after cleansing your skin. So,\nwhen you apply this base, you will notice that the skin really becomes more nourished,\nhydrated. Makeup, tonal foundations, correctors, especially\nunder-eye concealers, are very easy to apply on it. It's a good thing, I'll say this. I paid $80 for this base. And at first I didn\u2019t\nknow that this base should do this so that I could calmly pay that kind of money for it. But\nthe base is really good. It really hydrates the skin. But in my skin care kit of my\nproducts, there are some pretty good creams that cost 3-4 times cheaper. And I get\nexactly the same effect as this base from Bobby Brown. It's worth trying this base. It\nsmells great, it's nice, it has a good consistency, it's really moisturizing.\nBut for this money, friends, I would probably buy something else. I would just buy a good night\nmoisturizer and apply it before makeup. Sorry, but that's just my opinion. By the way, what\ndid you forget to say? None of these funds, which I will now name, are sponsored. There are no ads in this\nvideo. I just recently started making videos. I just created this channel,\nso I don't have ads yet. I bought all the products from this video myself, with my own money, I\nchose it myself, read the reviews. Therefore, today I will share with you purely my opinion. Moving on,\nafter applying this moisturizing base, or cream, if you have one, I apply a primer.\nThis primer is from Laura Mercier Pure Canvas Primer. It was recommended to me by the lady in the shop. Sephora and Douglas stores are popular\nin Poland. There I always buy all my cosmetics, because I\nknow that there will be no fakes, the quality is always good, everything comes on time, and the prices are normal.\nWe'll be back! What does a primer do? After you have applied a moisturizing base to your face, you\napply this primer in such cases: if you have large pores, if they are really visible,\nor if you have oily skin. In my case, I have combination skin - my t-zone and chin\nbecome oilier at the end of the day. And the cheeks are drier. In real life, my pores are normal,\nI would not say that they are very wide, but when I apply all these tonal foundations,\nall these concealers, I want to smooth out the tone of my face a little. To make the skin smooth for\nthe next stages of makeup. So this primer worked well for me. It is also not cheap, I\npaid about 50 or 60 dollars for it, which is not so cheap as we would like. But it is worth noting\nthat you will need it very, very little. I apply it literally a drop on the cheeks, chin and\nforehead. This is enough for me absolutely, so I hope that it will last long enough.\nWhat about tonal foundations? I have tried a lot of foundations. There is little\nthat suits me to make my makeup look as natural and natural as possible. But at the same time,\nI would like some imperfections, some pimples or something else to be\ncovered with a tonal foundation. I was looking for. And finally I found it! This is the Armani Luminous\nSilk foundation. I bought a small size because I was tired of spending money on all these tonal\nthe basics, oh, then they just didn\u2019t suit me. So here I already took a small size for myself,\nand it\u2019s good, because the first time I didn\u2019t hit the color at all. When I chose the tone\nin the store, the lighting there is completely different from that at home or on the street. And when I applied this tone\nat home, my face just turned white. My tone is in number 5. It turned out to be too light for me,\nbecause I use self-tanner. And when I applied self-tanner all over my body,\nI got a white mask on my face. It seemed the most bizarre. So of course\nI had to go back to the store and buy a second foundation - exactly the same,\nbut much darker so that I could combine them. And what do you think friends?\nYes! I bought another foundation. The one in number 5 is lighter. And the one\nin number 6.5 - this color is much darker. I combine them together, mix and apply\non the face. Today I am wearing these tones. I really, really like the effect. This tone somehow\nsmoothes everything, everything becomes somehow cool. It can also be layered. That is, if the first time\nyou applied this tone and it still does not overlap, then you can apply this tone again. And then\nit will work, you will have a more even skin tone. This is a bestseller, which is why I turned my\nattention to it. I paid 40 dollars for each of them. But again, I use it very little.\nI think it will last me a very, very long time. So my friends, I highly recommend it. If\nyou are looking for something? Then at least you can go to some nearest store and see\nhow it works for you. We have such a service. I think it's very popular when you come in,\nchoose products, and then ask to put all this on you. You walk, look closely, and if you\nlike it, you buy it. How do I apply foundation? I have two brushes. I beg your pardon,\none of them is dirty, because I did my makeup with it today. This brush is from it Cosmetics. It is\nthe most comfortable. It is very soft, very elastic. I wash it every time\nafter I use it. This brush is not cheap. I paid for it like\n30 or 25 dollars. For a brush, it's not that cheap. But when you buy it for a year,\nthen in principle you can invest. On the other side of the brush is a small concealer brush\n. It is also the most comfortable. I really like her. The second brush,\nwhich I like a little less, but it is also very cool, is the brush in\nnumber 56. It is also very soft, very cool, it is very convenient to apply the product on the face. When I\npaint, I first apply foundation on the face with a brush, and then to remove all unnecessary,\nI use a blender. Such a classic sponge. I think every beauty lover has one.\nThis is not the original beauty blender, this is such a sponge from Real Technics. I got it\nwhen I bought a set of brushes. A very convenient thing: with this side I blot my face.\nHere. I go under the eyes, near the nose, in short - I think the girls will understand me.\nWell, if the guys are watching me, then yes - a convenient thing, I think it will suit absolutely everyone. As\nfor the concealer, of course, after reading a bunch of reviews, I opted for Armani Power\nFabric. But please note, this is Power Fabric - it is not Luminous Silk. My foundation is\nLuminous Silk and this is Power Fabric. This is a slightly different line, it is as chic as possible. I\nnever thought that concealer would look so natural,\nso chic on the face. I had several concealers before, but I always miscalculated\nwith color. And in the end, the effect was obtained when I had such white circles as a panda. It all\nlooked terrible. In real life, it was still all right, but when I turned on the camera and started\nrecording my videos, I didn\u2019t like the effect at all. And this concealer is amazing,\nI have color 6.5. Let me show you what a brush looks like? There is a lot of product here. I think\nit will last me at least a year, maybe two. If it can be used two years after opening.\nAll in all, a great product, I recommend it! I apply concealer either with this brush from It Cosmetics or\nwith the brush from Sephora in number 57. It is also very, very comfortable. The reviews wrote that if you have problems\nwith the concealer, then perhaps the problem is not in the concealer itself, but in how you apply it. So\nbronzer! What bronzer do I use? Of course, today we will go through all the bestsellers that\nare on the market. Here's a Benefit bronzer in Hula. This is the most popular bronzer.\nThis is how he looks. In principle, the bronzer itself, and the bronzer. Great bronzer, easy to apply, easy to blend,\nno problems with it. The easiest way to work with this product.\nOnce I succumbed to marketing and bought another sculptor. Here's one from Fenty Beauty. Well\n, as you can see, I only used it once. It didn\u2019t fit me at all\n, I probably need to be able to use it. In general, it is not bad, but it needs to be shaded well immediately. I\nremember I once applied it, blended it, but when I went outside, I noticed that the strip\nremained on my face. I did not really shade it and I had to rub everything with my fingers. In general\n, probably a good product, this is not my product. As for the bronzer brush, I use this one\nfrom Real technicks in number 400. It's a basic brush and it's very popular. Sold in all sets.\nI think this is a multifunctional brush. You can use it to apply bronzer, blush, powder,\nand highlighter. She won't have any problems. And so - blush! What I really, really wanted to buy,\nbut what I didn\u2019t fit at all. Why? Because I personally noticed such an effect on myself\nthat when I apply blush before shooting. It creates such a look as if I\nwent too far with the bronzer, and as if my cheeks are somehow dirty. I don't like this effect.\nIn real life I use it. I have Nars blush. A very popular shade. He looks\ngood. The only thing I don't like is that it has big glitter in it. Good blush,\nbut the second time I will not buy them. Blush brush. I use a brush from Ecotools. Also very popular\nbrushes, soft, wash well, beautiful. They are inexpensive. I bought this brush in a set. By the way,\nI recently decided to invest in my brushes. And I bought a new set of brushes from the brand Rephr.\nIn general, when I test them, I will tell you about my impressions. So, one of the most important\nproducts for any blogger is powder. Because nothing ruins your look so much,\nwhen you put on your makeup, sit in front of the camera, and your face shines. In general, when the face shines\nlike a pancake, this is not good. This really spoils the frame, it's hard to\nfix it later on editing. I don't like this effect. I tried several powders and settled\non one of the most important bestsellers - this is Laura Mercier. Powder without shade, it is transparent,\nit takes on your complexion and your color. She's just awesome. I\nrecommend this product with all my heart. I had to buy a puff for this powder, because they probably\ndecided to save money and did not put a puff in powder, which costs 60 or 70 dollars. But\nin fairness, it should be noted that I have a small the size is not a full size\njar. But it will last me a long time. Because you apply it in a very, very small amount.\nShe's just awesome. For example, today I'm sitting in front of the camera, the lamp is frying me, it's\n35 degrees outside, I don't turn on my air conditioner, because the sound will be much worse, so\nthis powder is just number one for a blogger. I apply it with a puff. And everything is not as simple as\nwe would like. Now I'll show you how to apply it. Take powder, pour a little bit into the lid,\nthen take a puff, smear everything with this puff, take it later, start rubbing it, as you would\nlike to wash it. And then with such movements apply on the face. And the coolest thing is that it\nis applied on the face as easily as possible. Nothing complicated. Or I can sometimes apply it with this brush\nfrom Real Technics. I really like her. Brush in number 402. Also a very functional brush\n, I think it will suit everyone. The entire list of these products will be in the description of this video. You\ncan easily find any of the products. Thank you very much for your attention! I hope that\nI was able to help you in some way in choosing products. Friends, please write\nif you have such a starter kit, such a kit for a beginner, or just a cosmetic bag for all\noccasions? Maybe you have some favorites too? Products I don't know about yet?\nPlease write to me in the comments. I will be very interested. Subscribe, friends, to the channel.\nClick the bell to be notified of new releases. If you like\nthis release, then I invite you to watch this video. I think you should come and\nenjoy it too.

I recently cut bangs to hide the furrow lines.  Brighter lipsticks balance the silver hair, subtle eye shadows because I wear glasses.  I started taking 50+ vitamins going through perimenopause, and now I&#39;m over that hill.  I&#39;ve never had as many compliments on my hair, the &quot;color&quot;, the cut, and my complexion as I&#39;ve had the last three dye free years. Nature really does give us the color we&#39;re supposed to have. I&#39;ve gone to a single, soft shimmer just on my lids as they&#39;re hooded, simple smoked eyeliner, and it works. The shimmer gives a brightness behind my glasses. I still use Double Wear and still get compliments. Basically, we need to do what works for us.  This works for me. I&#39;m still glam, just older and more sparkly.",

I found that none of the ones I used have enough coverage: after couple hours my face is red again.

        "transcript_text": "today I'm going to show you guys how to\napply lipstick on dry leaves High\npigmented leaves or thin leaves if you\nhave any of these I got you covered you\ndon't need a lip liner plumper or\nanything else just a lipstick you like\nwithout further Ado let's just get right\ninto it\nfirst thing first we will talk about the\nbasics your lips are hydrated and you\nwant to get that classic for red lip\nlook at this stage you should prepare\nyour skin around your leaves to make\nyour lip color Stand Out people tend to\nforget this step but I always tell\npeople how important it is to apply\nconcealer or foundation around their\nleaves it makes a huge difference for\ncreating a sophisticated look if you\ncompare your lips with and without\nconcealer you will see that one looks\nmore delicate after that you are going\nto start from the inner corner of your\nleaves there are multiple ways to apply\nlipstick and there is no such a wrong or\nright way but my makeup Academy in all\nmakeup tutors recommend starting from\nthe inner corner of our leaves since it\nis hard to reach once you apply lipstick\nto the middle once you reach the inner\ncorner of your leaves you should slowly\nswipe towards the middle of your leaves\nat this stage you don't have to worry\nabout growing a perfect line you can\ndraw multiple times but not too many\nsince it might look too patchy if the\nlipstick lines is too obvious I found\nthat it makes the hole look a bit\nold-fashioned so I like blowing the edge\na little\nafter perfectly applying on the lower\nlip now I'm moving to the upper lid for\nthe upper Leaf I personally think\nthey're starting from the cute people is\na bit risky since it might create a\nnatural look so I like starting from the\ninner corner of my lips at this stage\ntoo starting from the inner corner and\nthen swiping inward you could apply a\nfew times and then try to find if there\nis any empty part and building them with\nlipstick\nif you have crack or dry leaves you\nmight have noticed your leaf sketch\nflaky after applying lipstick you might\nhave tried to put a lip balm on but it\ndidn't work the best thing to do at this\nstage is to use a leaf mask leave masks\nare Ultra thick and Ultra hydrating\nformulas that restore dry and cracked\nleaves you can put a lot of it on before\ngoing to bed or a bit before you apply a\nlipstick the limos I would like to\nintroduce today is audio Care Plus party\nbig mask it's not rich label lip mask\nwhich helps nourish the leaves for an\nextra boost of moisture with coconut\nwater hibiscus flour extract vitamin C\nand vitamin E it does not feel slippery\nor have that cold feeling but just\nsticks onto your lips which I love about\nI got this product from the flip app and\nyou can purchase I do care products and\nmany other brands products there easily\nit is a plus form that emphasized that\neveryone can make money by posting their\nown reviews or even just buy shopping I\npurchase multiple products from I do\ncare and this sleep mask has become my\nfavorite product from them if you like\nto selfie truthfully you can download\nthe flip app for free today and use code\nIDC 30 for 30 of your first audio care\npurchase on the app now let's move on to\nhyperpigmented leaves\nmy subscriber dbr has high probability\nleap and has kindly offered to be a lip\nmodel for this video if you look at her\nleaves the inner corner of her lips are\ndarker than the rest of our leaves and\nthe color of them are uneven firstly I'm\ngoing to apply a lip mask since her lips\nwill be dry after removing the surface\nlayer of the lip mask I'm going to apply\na layer of concealer in order to create\nan even canvas I will apply a bit of\nconcealer around her leaves these steps\ncan allow you to create an opaque clean\ncanvas as well as improving the\npigmentation of the lipstick you are\ngoing to use after blending the\nconcealer we are going to apply a base\nlipstick base lipsticks are lipsticks\nwith the shade closer to your natural\nskin color for her more like a nude page\nyou are going to apply it to make your\nlips one shade if you apply other\nlipsticks of your choice having this\nface layer where it enhance their other\nlipstick shade make your look more\nsophisticated and finished it after that\nI will finally be applying a red\nlipstick just as I have done previously\nI'm going to start from the inner Corner\nsometimes you can accidentally draw the\nliner over your natural lip lines if so\nyou can use a Q-tip with a bit of\nconcealer and swipe it over the lip\nlined part at this stage if you find it\ndifficult to apply lipstick and draw\nsophisticated lines use a thin lip brush\nor concealer brush instead it should be\nflat and has a bit of tension it will\nhelp you to draw the lines you want a\nlot easier you don't have to try and\nmake a perfect line all at once you can\njust slowly start filling your bottom\nlips since our lip lines run vertically\nif you like to increase the pigmentation\nof the lipstick it is better to apply a\nlipstick vertically by filling in the\nvertical lines and then try to blur the\nedge to make a softer look after that\nopen your mouth slightly and check if\nthere's any empty part of your inner\nleaves that have been made do the same\nfor your upper leaves start drawing the\nlines from the inner corner and then try\nto fill in the upper leaves I'm not\ntrying to draw a perfect line instead\nI'm using a Q-tip to make the lines\nclearer this does not require any\nprofessional technique and even if you\nare a makeup beginner you can get a\nsophisticated folded look now it's the\nfinal look if you compare before and\nafter you could see how it has changed\nif you want more pigmented leaf look you\ncould apply more layers of it lastly I'm\ngoing to talk about how to apply\nlipstick on thin leaves\nmy subscribers Sabrina has thin leaves\nand she has kindly helped out my video\nbeing a lead model if you see her leaves\nher lips are relatively thin compared to\ndevious and mine her bottom leaves are\nasymmetrical what I would do is I'm\ngoing to make her lips symmetric and try\nto make it Fuller but in a natural way\nsince our lips are also a bit dry I put\na bit of lip mask and then remove the\nsurface layer of it as I'm going to over\ndraw lip lines it is crucial to make a\nclean and even canvas so I'm going to\napply a bit of concealer around her lips\nas well and then draw the lines with a\nnude beige lipstick I used previously to\nguide the lines I'd like to draw to draw\nthe exact lines I want I'm using a flat\nbrush again now I have made her leave\nsymmetrical and overdrew the leaves a\nlittle and then I'm going to fill in\nthem with a red lipstick I'm going to\nmake the butter knit Fuller than the\nupper lips as you would be more ideal\nfor a natural look I'm starting from the\ninner Corner as always and try to follow\nthe guidelines I do previously I slowly\nfill in the lace with the lipstick\nproduct on the brush and then add more\npigmentation to it for thin leaves I\nfound that instead of lowering the edge\ndrawing the obvious line to fill in the\nasymmetric leaves would be better since\nwe are creating a fake line so I'm not\nreally blurring The Edge especially on\nthe bottom lips after finishing the\nbutter leaves I'm doing the same for the\nupper leaves but for upper leaves since\nthe cupid bow lies on the upper lips are\nobvious I'm not drawing the lines there\nas it would make them look more mature\nand unnatural so I would just leave the\nlines more transparent if you compare\nbefore and after you can see a huge\ndifference the lips are Fuller but in a\nnatural way so this was all about how to\napply lipstick or many different types\nof lace I hope you find this video video\nvery helpful shout out to my subscribers\nStevia and Sabrina for being model for\nthis video thank you so much if there's\nanything you want to know about lipstick\napplication or even lip product\nrecommendation please let me know on the\ncomment below I'd like to know about\nthat thank you so much for watching I\nwill see in the next one bye",

I recently cut bangs to hide the furrow lines.  Brighter lipsticks balance the silver hair, subtle eye shadows because I wear glasses.  I started taking 50+ vitamins going through perimenopause, and now I&#39;m over that hill.  I&#39;ve never had as many compliments on my hair, the &quot;color&quot;, the cut, and my complexion as I&#39;ve had the last three dye free years. Nature really does give us the color we&#39;re supposed to have. I&#39;ve gone to a single, soft shimmer just on my lids as they&#39;re hooded, simple smoked eyeliner, and it works. The shimmer gives a brightness behind my glasses. I still use Double Wear and still get compliments. Basically, we need to do what works for us.  This works for me. I&#39;m still glam, just older and more sparkly.",

I found that none of the ones I used have enough coverage: after couple hours my face is red again.

        "transcript_text": "Hey guys! So today we've got the brand new\u00a0\nCharlotte Tilbury Glow Glide Architect Highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\nthis comes in six different shades and  is $58\u00a0\nCanadian Dollars and of course the shades are gorgeous\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is the one I have right here this is called\u00a0\nmoonlit glow it's an iridescent Ivory and then\u00a0\u00a0\nyou've got Gilded Glow, a true gold champagne\u00a0\nglow a sparkling champagne color and then\u00a0\u00a0\nPillow Talk glow again that's stunning that is a\u00a0\nneutral pearly pink highlighter it is stunning so\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful rose gold true rose gold highlighter\u00a0\nand bronze glow which is a Golden Bronze color\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is the one I picked up moonlit glow\u00a0\nI honestly think that this is going to be\u00a0\u00a0\nstunning so actually this I thought would pull\u00a0\na little bit more on the gold tone side but when\u00a0\u00a0\nI swatched it which I will do for you right\u00a0\nnow this actually pulls a lot more silver\nstill really really pretty it is kind of like a\u00a0\npearlesque champagne really light it's got gold\u00a0\u00a0\nin there it's got silver it's like a neutral\u00a0\nhonestly it's just gorgeous and that's colored\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it Glides on like a dream let's start there\u00a0\nnow the formula is made to feel like it goes on\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a liquid but it is a powder and it 100% is\u00a0\na powder. It swatches gorgeous like it's just\u00a0\u00a0\nstunning so this glow boosting formula claims\u00a0\nto help blur the skin after you've highlighted\u00a0\u00a0\nso instead of emphasizing it's gonna blur, so\u00a0\nI'm very excited to try that out and test it\u00a0\u00a0\nout with you guys so let's just dive right in!\nCharlotte suggests six different ways to apply\u00a0\u00a0\nthis product which is amazing and I can't wait to\u00a0\nshow them all to you now there are five ways that\u00a0\u00a0\nI normally go in like we all do pretty much to\u00a0\napply our highlighter but she does recommend that\u00a0\u00a0\nplacing the highlighter on the jawline will do and\u00a0\nI will share that with you in a moment but to me\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm just like really on the jawline highlighter\u00a0\nI don't see that happening but we will test it\u00a0\u00a0\nout and try it out together so we're gonna go\u00a0\nin I'm just gonna pick up this is my favorite\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlighting brush it's not a Charlotte Tilbury\u00a0\nthis is actually a Colourpop F33 brush and\u00a0\u00a0\nI just love this brush for applying highlighter\u00a0\nbecause it's just so soft and just fluffy and\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful just applies it's gorgeous but if you\u00a0\nguys have a brush that you really really love\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I've been on a brush Journey right now\u00a0\nand I've been purchasing a couple of brushes now\u00a0\u00a0\nif you have a brush just one brush two brushes if\u00a0\nyou have the whole collection that you super love\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me know in the comments down below because\u00a0\nI am looking to buy some different brushes and\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm like really stepping out into like the higher\u00a0\nend brushes but let me know if you guys have like\u00a0\u00a0\nan elf brush you super love or a Mac brush let me\u00a0\nknow what your favorite makeup brush is because\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm super curious okay so let's just dip right\u00a0\ninto this for an instant lifted effect on her\u00a0\u00a0\nwebsite she recommends that we take it from the\u00a0\ncheekbone and glide upwards to the temple and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen blend it out so I'm going to go ahead and do\u00a0\nthat so I'm just going to pick up a little bit of\u00a0\u00a0\nthis product we're just going to do a full face\u00a0\nwith this I'm just going to tap off a little bit\nokay that is stunning that is a beautiful\u00a0\nhighlighter it is definitely very soft and less\u00a0\u00a0\nstriking than say a Scott Barnes which has been\u00a0\nmy go-to highlighter for a while or Pat McGrath\u00a0\u00a0\nI love a Pat McGrath but this is just that's a\u00a0\nbeautiful shade do you guys see that hopefully\u00a0\u00a0\nthe camera is picking it up it's just stunning and\u00a0\nit's not emphasizing anything so I love that for\u00a0\u00a0\nbigger and brighter eyes we're going to move on\u00a0\nto step number two and we're going to apply this\u00a0\u00a0\nright here to the inner corner of the eye to\u00a0\nthe outer corner of the eye and right there in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe center of the eye as well applying it to the\u00a0\ninner corner of the eye is going to draw your eye\u00a0\u00a0\nInward and make your eyes look a little bit more\u00a0\nPoppy and just bigger and just accentuate that by\u00a0\u00a0\napplying some right here on your outer Corner\u00a0\nthat's going to make your eyes look wider and\u00a0\u00a0\nlarger and then by applying it right here just on\u00a0\nthe top of your lid in the center of your lid it's\u00a0\u00a0\njust going to really emphasize your eye look and\u00a0\nmake your eyes pop now contouring your nose I went\u00a0\u00a0\nin earlier with just a little bit of bronzer just\u00a0\ndown the center of my nose because that's how I\u00a0\u00a0\nnormally do it I have like a nose that I actually\u00a0\nreally kind of like if you guys want to go in with\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit more Contour go for it but seriously\u00a0\nI've been really just you know going with more of\u00a0\u00a0\na natural beauty look lately so I am going to\u00a0\ngo in with a little tiny brush right here I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna actually I'm not going to go in with much\u00a0\nmore highlighter than I have on the brush from\u00a0\u00a0\nthe previous look but I'm just going to just go\u00a0\ndown the center of the nose just a little bit and\u00a0\u00a0\nshe recommends just putting just a little bit on\u00a0\nthe tip Charlotte calls this her nose exclamation\u00a0\u00a0\npoint you can draw the highlighter down the center\u00a0\nof the nose and then add a little bit on the tip\u00a0\u00a0\nand then just blend that out with your finger if\u00a0\nyou feel like you've added too much to diffuse\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shade for step four we're going to apply\u00a0\nthis just under our brow bone to give a very\u00a0\u00a0\nlifted effect to the eye look I'm going to take\u00a0\njust a little bit again smaller brush is the best\u00a0\u00a0\nI like this one just because it's kind of soft\u00a0\nand pliable and it's not terribly sharp but you\u00a0\u00a0\ncould go in with a more denser pencil brush\u00a0\nif you really wanted more of a defined look\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm going to apply this where she suggests\u00a0\nwhich is right here if you guys notice when\u00a0\u00a0\nyou're looking at your brow you're going\u00a0\nto go from basically the tip of your nose\u00a0\u00a0\nall the way up to that High Point that's where\u00a0\nyou're going to start at that high point so you're\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to start right here and just add a little\u00a0\nbit of that Shimmer right there and that's just\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to make your brow Pop I tend not to go in\u00a0\nmore than that area because if you go in a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit more it's going to draw your face in this way\u00a0\nit's going to make your brows look a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nrounder you're going to look a little bit more\u00a0\nsurprised if you're going for that look all the\u00a0\u00a0\npower to you you're going to look fabulous but if\u00a0\nyou don't want to look so surprised and you want\u00a0\u00a0\nto look younger more blown out and just Angelic\u00a0\nlike definitely stay with that guideline step five\u00a0\u00a0\nFuller looking lips now my best recommendation\u00a0\nfor this is to actually go in with your Contour or\u00a0\u00a0\nyour bronzer and add a little bit just under your\u00a0\nlips right here to kind of give a shadow right\u00a0\u00a0\nunder your lip and then go in with the highlighter\u00a0\nright here at your Cupid's bow I'm gonna just\u00a0\u00a0\ndraw down on either side of my Cupid's bow not\u00a0\ngoing in directly in the center but right here\non the very top of the lip I just added just a\u00a0\nlittle bit and that really just brightens the\u00a0\u00a0\nface now step six the jawline Yes you heard\u00a0\nme right so on Charlotte's website she says\u00a0\u00a0\nto get a really sculpted framework for your face\u00a0\nin seconds to go in and add a little bit of this\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct on your jawline to avoid the chin which I\u00a0\nwould completely recommend so I usually go in and\u00a0\u00a0\nadd a little bit of Contour right here just under\u00a0\nmy jaw and I stop I'll sometimes add a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nright here but I usually stop right about here and\u00a0\nI blend that out I blend it down which is going to\u00a0\u00a0\nmake just a little bit of a concave effect to make\u00a0\nyou look a little bit more snatched a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nmore thinner it's a really amazing effect and\u00a0\nI definitely recommend you guys try it out if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou haven't seen it I've put it in a bunch of my\u00a0\nvideos this happens to be a Smith brush but just\u00a0\u00a0\npick up a smaller fluffier brush to apply this\u00a0\nso we're going to tap that off because you don't\u00a0\u00a0\nwant a lot of highlight on your jawline now we're\u00a0\ngoing to place this I'm going to start right here\u00a0\u00a0\njust kind of at the tip of my ear down down\u00a0\nand just right there I'm not going to go past\u00a0\u00a0\nright here so this is like a three-quarter Mark\u00a0\nbetween here and your chin and I'm just going to\u00a0\u00a0\ngo in with such a slight amount because I don't\u00a0\nwant that area of my face to Glow it's just going\u00a0\u00a0\nto look beautiful so I didn't apply any on the\u00a0\nother side you can totally tell the difference\u00a0\u00a0\nI honestly like the blur like this is really\u00a0\nbeautiful I like the Highlight right here the\u00a0\u00a0\neye highlights stunning it's beautiful I love how\u00a0\nit's eye friendly that's amazing right here we've\u00a0\u00a0\ngot a beautiful highlight on the jaw normally\u00a0\nI wouldn't place it there if it was like a red\u00a0\u00a0\ncarpet event or something like that then yeah\u00a0\nokay maybe I'll I'll do that just so that the\u00a0\u00a0\ncamera has that flash and you've got that pop of\u00a0\nhighlight there but for regular everyday you know\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to work I probably wouldn't bother to put\u00a0\nit on my jaws because I don't I wouldn't I just\u00a0\u00a0\nwouldn't but what do you guys think let me know\u00a0\nin the comments down below I love this product\u00a0\u00a0\nnow if you're looking at this side the finished\u00a0\nside it's stunning and then you've got this side\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't have any product on there big difference\u00a0\nright so this is 58 Canadian I think it's really\u00a0\u00a0\nreally beautiful and the price point is pretty\u00a0\ndecent now comparing it to something like say a\u00a0\u00a0\nNars highlighter or a Fenty highlighter it they're\u00a0\nall in the same price range so I think it's really\u00a0\u00a0\nreally pretty and honestly for a Charlotte\u00a0\nTilbury product like this is just it's glowy\u00a0\u00a0\nit's bright it's uplifting it's stunning I do 100\u00a0\nrecommend it I think it's beautiful and I think\u00a0\u00a0\nyou'll super love it as well let me know if you\u00a0\npick it up if you guys want an amazing beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nFoundation that will pair beautifully with this\u00a0\ndefinitely watch my video on the Charlotte Tilbury\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful skin Foundation right there all

I recently cut bangs to hide the furrow lines.  Brighter lipsticks balance the silver hair, subtle eye shadows because I wear glasses.  I started taking 50+ vitamins going through perimenopause, and now I&#39;m over that hill.  I&#39;ve never had as many compliments on my hair, the &quot;color&quot;, the cut, and my complexion as I&#39;ve had the last three dye free years. Nature really does give us the color we&#39;re supposed to have. I&#39;ve gone to a single, soft shimmer just on my lids as they&#39;re hooded, simple smoked eyeliner, and it works. The shimmer gives a brightness behind my glasses. I still use Double Wear and still get compliments. Basically, we need to do what works for us.  This works for me. I&#39;m still glam, just older and more sparkly.",

Thank you for doing these videos.  I&#39;m 62 and although I embrace my age I feel beautiful with a touch of makeup.",

I do use a setting spray at the end to ensure I don&#39;t have a powdery look. I have some liquid foundations but they don&#39;t set on my skin and I stay sticky all day long - even my hair sticks to my face even after using a setting powder! No ma&#39;am, powder foundation is where it&#39;s at - for me. I still love your videos and appreciate all of the tips - you rock!!",

Game. Changer.!",

May I ask - what foundation would be the best to use to cover Rosacea? As I got older it&#39;s taking over my whole face. I found that none of the ones I used have enough coverage: after couple hours my face is red again. Or maybe it will be possible to make a video about proper makeup for us - young ladies at heart \u263a - who suffer from Rosacea? Thank you in advance.",

I still love to experiment with new makeup looks, but basically deep down I know what works and what I did 20s and 30s just doesn\u2019t serve me anymore. Your application was spot on and I picked up a few good tips!  So thank you!",

        "transcript_text": "Hello everyone, I\u2019m Mudi,\nwelcome\nback to my channel\nand join me in scientific skincare and rational planting of grass. Today\n, I\u2019m reviewing Neutrogena\nMineral UV tint , a physical sunscreen that\u2019s\n \nabout the same price as ELF\nwhoa glow . What\u2019s the difference between the two? The\ndifference is that they are suitable for any skin type.\nI put them together because they are very similar in\nmany aspects.\nBoth have touch-ups\nand will not turn white. They will\ngive you a slight luster.\nThere is no concealer , but it can neutralize uneven skin tone. It is\nespecially\nsuitable for lazy skin.\nPeople, one-step sunscreen,\ntouch up + sunscreen + moisturizer.\nIt moisturizes well. You\ndon\u2019t have to think too much. You can apply sunscreen before\ngoing out , and they are very suitable for\nsensitive skin. They are all No fragrance and\nno extra fragrance. Adding\nno alcohol, no fragrance,\nno irritating ingredients to stimulate essential oils, in\ntheory , you don\u2019t have to worry about acne,\nstuffy sunscreen\nIf you only buy one can, which one would you choose?\nThey actually have many differences.\nELF is a pure chemical sunscreen.\nIt uses traditional American chemistry.\nSunscreens like\navobenzone are definitely available.\nIt\u2019s very light on the\n \nface and gives you a slightly watery glow on your skin. It\u2019s not that greasy. It\u2019s less\nthan supergoop\u2019s glow. The glow is more natural and healthier,\nnot that It looks like you put on a highlighter.\nI just got it.\nI have used it so much in two weeks. I use it\nalmost every day. It is\nvery suitable for mixed oily skin.\nIts chemical sunscreen is doomed.\nIt is a relatively\nlight and light one\n. Pure physical sunscreen\n, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and\nzinc oxide are actually added to 21.6%\n. When I saw this ratio,\nI thought it must be very greasy,\nbut it\u2019s not as greasy as I thought. It\u2019s definitely not watery\non the\n \nface.\n \nUnlike\nELF, which is watery and light,\nit\n \nwill leave a layer of oil film on your face\n \n.\nYou can feel its sun protection power is overwhelming . It feels safe when you put it on.\nAnd I like that it is color-coded.\nI chose light and the whitest.\nIt\n\u2019s a light pink color that matches my skin tone pretty well. My\nface was a little pale when I first applied it. After 5 minutes or 10 minutes , you can\u2019t feel its color on it. Both\nof\nthem are not concealer.\nIf If you want to choose a concealer that\ncan save foundation, they are neither of them, but you know that the refraction of\nlight and the reflection of light will weaken your pores and your fine lines.\nThat's why I wear them both and I can feel at ease. No more foundation in the future, it can\nstill\nbe called a makeup cream, but you can\u2019t count on acne marks, it\ncan only weaken your blemishes a little bit. In\nterms of moisturizing power, Neutrogena \u2019s may be a little bit better, but both of them are quite good. Moisturizing Neutrogena\n, you feel that you are using a moisturizer and an oil\n, so you must use a loose powder to set your makeup afterwards,\notherwise you will look like an 18 copper person at the beginning. If\n \nyou have sensitive skin and dry skin,\nyou don\u2019t like sunscreen. If you have\nhot eyes, Neutrogena\nwill be more suitable for you\n, because Because of its sunscreen, it is\ndestined to be a milder sunscreen,\nbut do I usually use loose powder to set my makeup?\nI\u2019m sure that ELF doesn\u2019t have hot eyes\n, nor does it make me cry\n, and as a person with mixed oil skin,\nI\u2019m more I like ELF's light and light watery effect\nrather than oily one.\nBut Neutrogena, I\nhave to say here that its\nadvantages are actually better than ELF's\n. The first one is that it has a better makeup effect than ELF\n. It is very easy to apply makeup afterwards\nIt fits well and won\u2019t\nmake the foundation mottled\n. I also said this in the last video on ELF.\nIt will get stuck under my eyes\nand all my lines. You\ncan feel the tint and the touch up as if floating on the skin.\nBut Neutrogena completely melts into the skin.\nI thought that physical sunscreen would be unsuitable.\nNot at all.\nIt is super compliant,\nsuper suitable for wearing makeup, and has\noil control\n. I think it is better than ELF. It\nis the same way of setting makeup,\nso it lasts.\nIn terms of makeup, I prefer\nNeutrogena\nin terms of base makeup, including it. It\n \nwill not make the foundation or your skin dull.\n \nSo many advantages,\nbut its price is twice as expensive as ELF.\nNeutrogena is 30ml\nand ELF is 50ml.\nIf you calculate by 50ml,\nELF is $14\n. If you use Neutrogena for 50ml\n, it becomes $28.\nIt is twice as expensive. Has the price reached 20-30 dollars?\nOnce upon a time , I remembered that it was still 10 dollars\n, especially the price of ELF\n3 dollars. Do you still remember that\nnow it costs more than ten dollars for any item? It is much easier\n \nto use than the previous ones.\n \nSeeing now\n, it is easy to choose the sunscreen in your heart.\nIf you want to wear makeup, choose Neutrogena\n. Its durability\nis much better and the feeling of peeling off the skin is much better. It is also waterproof\n, 80% waterproof\nMinutes is very\nsuitable for summer\nwhen you are prone to sweating and oily.\nIt really has that kind of skin-like feeling. It\nis firmly peeled off. It is the kind of sunscreen\nELF that will not fall off at all. It is not written as waterproof, which\nis relatively more daily\nand more suitable for me . I get used to my daily life, for example\n, I go to a supermarket,\nI go to a park, and\nI don\u2019t need to take two or three hours.\nI don\u2019t need to take off my makeup when I get home.\nWaterproof touch-ups must be done.\nI would suggest everyone to take off your makeup\nor you You can also\nuse a facial cleanser\nwith makeup remover power,\nbut I won\u2019t use makeup remover alone like this kind of non-waterproof and\nvery light one. As I said, you must set the makeup around your eyes and\nuse loose powder to seriously wash\nyou Right now, the eyelids are all fixed,\notherwise this traditional sunscreen\nmight irritate the eyes.\nNow the price is getting better and better.\nThese two products are very qualified in my opinion. I\ndon\u2019t know which one you will choose.\nYes If you have any questions, you can leave a comment below. Thank\nyou for watching.\nDon\u2019t forget to like the video.\nShare, subscribe, and follow my channel\n. See you next time. Bye~",

I recently cut bangs to hide the furrow lines.  Brighter lipsticks balance the silver hair, subtle eye shadows because I wear glasses.  I started taking 50+ vitamins going through perimenopause, and now I&#39;m over that hill.  I&#39;ve never had as many compliments on my hair, the &quot;color&quot;, the cut, and my complexion as I&#39;ve had the last three dye free years. Nature really does give us the color we&#39;re supposed to have. I&#39;ve gone to a single, soft shimmer just on my lids as they&#39;re hooded, simple smoked eyeliner, and it works. The shimmer gives a brightness behind my glasses. I still use Double Wear and still get compliments. Basically, we need to do what works for us.  This works for me. I&#39;m still glam, just older and more sparkly.",

I found that none of the ones I used have enough coverage: after couple hours my face is red again.

        "transcript_text": "hello to all I hope you are well we find ourselves today with a video which\nwill be a tutorial video where we will test products that I have not yet used but that\nI presented to you during my haul sales and it's at the level of Nyx and it's the collection that\ncame out with the film Avatar so I explained to you that I had taken the palette which is\nthis one with all these absolutely magnificent eyeshadows and Farman duo headlights chrome it's really a\nvery very beautiful palette I also took the pandoran Paradise blush palette which looks\nlike this and with it we are going to take the opportunity to also test the new foundation the\nBlur foundation which also released the Nyx brand I'm going to try to use as many\nNyx products as possible for all of this make-up since I still have quite a few you'll find\nall the links in the info bar as I usually do and for\nmakeup we start together uite for this make-up and apply my care and at the level of the base I\nwill use the Shine killer of Nyx it is a primer it is a base that I like which\nreally allows to attenuate the shines that I can have on my face surprising thing it\nis black but it is absolutely not serious I since when you apply it on your face\nit completely penetrates the level of the skin and it leaves absolutely no black veil\nso I apply it very very little I apply it well on the wings of the nose I just smooth\non my cheek I also apply it on the forehead and a little on the chin\nin fact essentially on my middle zone which is the zone that goes going to have the most\nshine as the day progresses since I have combination skin in terms\nof foundation and well we will take the Blur foundation mine is in vanilla shade which is\nshade 05 this foundation it is with medium coverage it has a matte finish and it\nhas a blurring effect I'm going to apply it all of a sudden it's still quite liquid\nand I'm going to work it with my brush\nso that's the brush that came out with the can't stop want stop foundation\nso here it is for the result once I applied the Chevry foundation try\nto zoom in a little bit to show you a little bit more almost it's so here\nat the level of the foundation so it's clear that the finish is matte I didn't put a lot\nI put the equivalent let's say of a pump so it's true that the coverage is average\nwe still see some small imperfections which appear in transparency so it's true\nthat if we ever came to work on the foundation we put on a second layer I\nthink we would achieve a coverage that would be a little bit more important afterwards\nit's not bad on the other hand I can assure you that although I have a combination skin it's a matte finish\nthe skin really needs to be very very b well hydrated maybe my skin is\njust a little bit lacking in hydration and maybe i didn't hydrate it enough this morning here i see it's a\nlittle bit like this like the foundation is settling lay down badly as if I had\ntrouble in high school so you really don't have to have any areas of dryness in your face that's\noften the case with matte foundations you have to have very, very good hydration from the skin\notherwise it will come on the contrary to mark all the small areas of dryness which could\npossibly be there I think I do not know if this foundation it is not specified I did\nnot see it if it was for everything skin type or not I'm not sure if this foundation is suitable for\ndry to very dry skin I'm afraid it marks your skin and gives you\na kind of a little cracked effect I don't know if if you see what I mean we\n're going to go to the level of the concealer the concealer I'm going to pre ndre the born to glow I will put the\nreference for you at the level of the info bar because without unless I can see it it's the Light\nivory it's true that sometimes without the glasses it's not always obvious it's this concealer\nwhich has the little foam tip I'm not going to put it on my mobile eyelid since\nI'm going to come and apply a NYX base and I'm going to work it with a small brush\nfor the eye base I'm going to apply the Ultimate base\nI'm going to use it simply spread with your finger we will be able to use powder I will apply the\nMatt flat stay mat powder mine is in a soft beige shade I will not\napply it with the little sponge that is inside I'm really going to apply it\nwith a big brush I'm going to put it all over the place, even on my mobile eyelid\nI fixed my eyebrows with my Nyx freak control I don't have a Nyx pencil so suddenly\nI left my eyebrows like that I'm going to put you on the other hand a photo of the Swatches of the\nNyx avatar palette and I'm getting closer and we're going to start working on the eyes right away\nyou'll see I think we're going to focus on this part because that it's true that there are\nshades there are tei ntes green here there are shades a little khaki in fact there are really\ncolors that I find extremely beautiful extremely interesting here for the zoom\nwe will start right away I will take a fine brush with a brush 44 Nicks and I will\ntake this tint this green tint which in fact it's a tint that attracted me from the\nmoment I opened the palette this tint I don't know the pigmentation of headlights at\nall we're going to discover all that together I'm going there apply at the level of my eyelid crease\nI'm going to apply it on the first half of my eyelid crease then the headlights I'm going all\nI think to work them work them dry I don't hesitate to degrade well\nto exceed the right\ncrease a little bit like this I then take a Mac 217 brush and I'm going to take this shade\nthis shade I'm going to deposit it obliquely at the level of the last third of my\nmobile eyelid and I'm then going to degrade it to specify the outer corner of my makeup\nI'm going to deg it drag on my eyelid fold to make it connect with the green color\nthat I had deposited just before then I will not cover the green color at all but on\nthe other hand I will degrade it far enough so that the two colors can blend between them\nI then take a 228 brush from Zo\u00e9 va I'm going to take a little bit of this\nkhaki shade not much really very very little I really have almost nothing on my brush\nI just use this khaki shade to brush the outline of my make-up\nto avoid there being, let's say, a brutal demarcation so I apply very little of it because\nit's a color it's a color that shows I'm going to take my 117 Mac brush and I\n'm going to take this green shade I keep the same brush I don't clean it if the green color\nmixes a little bit with brown and well listen why not it will be lower and I'm going to deposit\nthis shade at the level of the last third of my mobile eyelid I'm not going to go up on\nall of my outer corner I'm going to stay only at the level of the mobile eyelid\nand on the other hand I'm going to degrade it at the level of my natural eyelid crease\nI then take a shader brush this one is a 234 Zo\u00e9 va I'm going to take this shade\nso there we're not going to be on a matte shade anymore I'm careful so at the level of\nmatch shades absolutely no fall for the moment we'll see with the shades that\nare slightly iridescent this shade I'm going to apply at the level of my\nmobile eyelid on the first third of my mobile eyelid on the other hand I will be careful\nI will not cover all of the green shade that we had put at the beginning there I\nwill really degrade this dark green shade at the level of my eyelid crease and no higher\nit is a very very beautiful color\nand with the edge of my brush I degrade well\nI blend this color well at the level of my eyelid crease\nas far as my outer corner is concerned I will resume Always use my Mac brush and I'm going to\ntake this color which is a brown color but much darker I just tap\nit on my mobile eyelid so I'm really going to do the rest of my mobile eyelid\nand there I'm going to degrade with the green\nI then take my 234 brush again I'm going to turn it over and I'm going to take this\niridescent shade which is next to the keke shade this shade I'm going to place it at the level of the center\nof my mobile eyelid\nperhaps to be not as iridescent as I thought\nI'm going to take another brush and this shade here I'm going to apply it\nat the level of the inner corner but I'm also going to\nstretch it on the first third of my mobile eyelid so it will\nactually cover the dark green shade that I had applied just before\nis simply to have a little more effect on the eyes we will be\nable to take care of the lower lash line the lower lash line I will take\nthis shade towards iridescent it's really a pine green it's very very beautiful\nI'm going to degrade with the khakimat shade\nfor the start of my lower lash line I'm going to reprogram this little shade\nand I'm going on the other hand with a smuge brush close up a little bit of this shade and\njust come and apply it to my upper rassil at the outer corner\nand I'm going to degrade it to give the effect of a liner\nI'm going to apply the mascara underwise off camera and I'll come back to you to finish\nthe complexion that's it for the final result once we have applied the mascara\nvery good very good we will suddenly move on to the blush and the apple palette from Oran Paradise\ntherefore which consists of 4 blushes which are going to be a little bit they are a little bit little\ncreamy all the same it's cream powder and here you have similar top coats to add\nglitter I'm going I think I'm going to mix these two so I'm going to start\nwith this one it's true that we I have the impression that it's still extremely extremely pigmented\nit's pretty it shows so I take a little which is not too much in my habit\nbut I'm still a little afraid of finding myself a a bit like a Pierrot let's say\nit's really pretty it's very very pretty I like it this color is a\nlittle bloody here for the blush I'm still going to try to apply a little bit this one\nI'm going to apply it on top\nI like the facts\nit tones down the color a little bit but it was it's still a very pretty color I'm going\nto try I'm going to try to apply a little bit of this iridescent tint I'm going to apply it there\nI put very very little very very little because in addition good as I am in make-up in\ngreen tones, it's not bad if we're going to have an effect, but I admit that it's\nnot necessarily something that particularly suits me I tried them like that\nbut hey it's not necessarily what I prefer in the collection I'm going\nto take a Nyx highlighter brush and I'm going to slightly add this glittery shade\nI'm going to use it a little bit of highlighter so I'm going to level it up of my nose\nI'm going to put some at the outer corner\nof my makeup just above above my blush I'm going to degrade it in the direction of my aunt\nand a little at the level of Cupid's bow\nhere we are and we'll be able to move on to the lips and the lips I'm simply going to\napply a soft mat to cream mix mine is in shade L\u00e9on so we are really on\nsomething nude but maybe I would come and put a little bit of blush\nhere and I will indeed re-apply a little bit of the lighthouse\na little bit of the iridescent blush on the lips and we will be done with this look\nwhat to tell you I really like this palette very honestly there is just a little bit\nof the glittery FAR headlights which created my few very small very small very\nsmall fall at the level of my under mourning but really nothing from catastrophic it started with\na brushstroke but you can absolutely if you prefer to start by doing the eyes\nyou will end up with the complexion apart from that the colors are very very beautiful there we are really on\nshades of green j have tried to use all the green shades of the palette it is seen I\nI don't necessarily know if it will come out very well and on camera but in any case I who\nhave a return with a mirror which is a little further away I really see the glass gradients\nthat I applied I find it very very pretty this palette is a real success from Nyx I\nthink this palette goes very well annix with colors that may seem a\nlittle crazy when you see like that but in fact there is everything you can do\nextravagant makeup but you can also do much softer makeup much more\nhappening everywhere here is for this tutorial I hope you enjoyed it don't hesitate to tell me\nin the comments if you have this collection if you know it and if so what is - what do you\nthink of it do you like it or on the contrary were you disappointed I remind you that\nthe sales are until February 7th and that this avatar collection is on sale at Nyx\nyou have 30% off if i'm not mistaken so very honestly it's really worth it\nsince you can have this great palette for just under 30 euros so I\nthink it's a good deal don't hesitate to put a thumbs up if you enjoyed this\nvideo n also do not hesitate to subscribe to my channel to follow me and to support me\nwe will leave it there for today I put you as usual some photos\nof the final look and I say see you very soon for new video bye",

I recently cut bangs to hide the furrow lines.  Brighter lipsticks balance the silver hair, subtle eye shadows because I wear glasses.  I started taking 50+ vitamins going through perimenopause, and now I&#39;m over that hill.  I&#39;ve never had as many compliments on my hair, the &quot;color&quot;, the cut, and my complexion as I&#39;ve had the last three dye free years. Nature really does give us the color we&#39;re supposed to have. I&#39;ve gone to a single, soft shimmer just on my lids as they&#39;re hooded, simple smoked eyeliner, and it works. The shimmer gives a brightness behind my glasses. I still use Double Wear and still get compliments. Basically, we need to do what works for us.  This works for me. I&#39;m still glam, just older and more sparkly.",

I found that none of the ones I used have enough coverage: after couple hours my face is red again.

I recently cut bangs to hide the furrow lines.  Brighter lipsticks balance the silver hair, subtle eye shadows because I wear glasses.  I started taking 50+ vitamins going through perimenopause, and now I&#39;m over that hill.  I&#39;ve never had as many compliments on my hair, the &quot;color&quot;, the cut, and my complexion as I&#39;ve had the last three dye free years. Nature really does give us the color we&#39;re supposed to have. I&#39;ve gone to a single, soft shimmer just on my lids as they&#39;re hooded, simple smoked eyeliner, and it works. The shimmer gives a brightness behind my glasses. I still use Double Wear and still get compliments. Basically, we need to do what works for us.  This works for me. I&#39;m still glam, just older and more sparkly.",

After having oily skin for most of my life &amp; always using mattifying products, i came to find that as i got older, my skin was no longer oily &amp; I had to start moving to more moisturizing &amp; luminous products. Game. Changer.!",

May I ask - what foundation would be the best to use to cover Rosacea? As I got older it&#39;s taking over my whole face. I found that none of the ones I used have enough coverage: after couple hours my face is red again. Or maybe it will be possible to make a video about proper makeup for us - young ladies at heart \u263a - who suffer from Rosacea? Thank you in advance.",

I am also a stylist and makeup artist and in my sixties now. I still love to experiment with new makeup looks, but basically deep down I know what works and what I did 20s and 30s just doesn\u2019t serve me anymore. Your application was spot on and I picked up a few good tips!  So thank you!",

As for Skin Care,\nI recently started using this one from Vichy and on INCI Beauty it has a score of 16.1 out of 20 so \nit's very good, it's like a gel and leaves the skin very fresh and not heavy\non the eyes instead I always use this from the same line which has a score\nof 15.2 on INCI beauty so this one is also very good I put it on my finger...\nI put it on my ring finger because it is the finger that is less strong so it doesn't\nbeats too hard under the eye which is a very delicate point.\nI recently started using this Sephora foundation as a base which is rated very high on INCI Beauty\nat 18.9 out of 20, therefore very good. In fact I'm finding it very good, I use very very little\nas a concealer I use this one from Maybelline So... on INCI beauty it is rated 0 out of 20\nso I would say that I will change it as soon as possible but I want to finish it first before changing it\nHowever I apply a very small amount o product. Then when I finish it I will buy a better one for sure\nMy eyebrows I like to leave them very natural and I have been using this one from Benefit for a\nwhile now, I must say that it keeps them very very firm, it really does its job\nit manages to help me by giving me a natural look but keeping the eyebrows firm\nfor the eyes... since I have slightly round eyes I have to... i mean I like to lengthen the eye a bit so\nI'm using this brown wycon pencil called wonderful eye pencil 105 choco\nI got it thinking it would blend nicely but actually I\ndon't recommend it much for those who want to blend but now I've got this and I'm keeping it\nand then as much as possible I'm going to blend\n I'm going to put on some mascara I use this one\nfrom Sephora and this one is also brown because with my colors of eyes and hair I prefer to\ngo brown rather than black\nnow my favorite lip product is this one\nnuxe r\u00e8ve de miel if you have always chapped lips like me it's perfect, really excellent\nand then it's very moisturizing so even putting it on at night even a little more abundant\nmakes you wake up with perfect lips this one on INCI Beauty has a score of 17.1 out of 20 therefore\nvery very good.

I know your cats refuse to choose your makeup lol but I love seeing you figure out how to make certain products work so I was thinking maybe you can randomly pick two items (like a shadow palette and a lipstick) and build a look around them!

I recently cut bangs to hide the furrow lines.  Brighter lipsticks balance the silver hair, subtle eye shadows because I wear glasses.  I started taking 50+ vitamins going through perimenopause, and now I&#39;m over that hill.  I&#39;ve never had as many compliments on my hair, the &quot;color&quot;, the cut, and my complexion as I&#39;ve had the last three dye free years. Nature really does give us the color we&#39;re supposed to have. I&#39;ve gone to a single, soft shimmer just on my lids as they&#39;re hooded, simple smoked eyeliner, and it works. The shimmer gives a brightness behind my glasses. I still use Double Wear and still get compliments. Basically, we need to do what works for us.  This works for me. I&#39;m still glam, just older and more sparkly.",

I have some liquid foundations but they don&#39;t set on my skin and I stay sticky all day long - even my hair sticks to my face even after using a setting powder! No ma&#39;am, powder foundation is where it&#39;s at - for me. I still love your videos and appreciate all of the tips - you rock!!",

I found that none of the ones I used have enough coverage: after couple hours my face is red again. Or maybe it will be possible to make a video about proper makeup for us - young ladies at heart \u263a - who suffer from Rosacea? Thank you in advance.",

palette I'm getting ready to\u00a0\u00a0\ngo to go look at Christmas lights um and so we're\u00a0\ngonna play around with the coffee shop but I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna do like a smoldering smokey eye I may play\u00a0\naround in their blush too I wanted to come and\u00a0\u00a0\nshow you guys some products that Tick Tock made\u00a0\nme buy so that's what we are going to be doing\u00a0\u00a0\nso guys so I wanted to make this short and sweet\u00a0\nso we are getting straight into this I'm starting\u00a0\u00a0\noff with my Dermablend cover cream this is in\u00a0\nthe shade Olive Brown it's great for that extra\u00a0\u00a0\ncoverage as well as scarves and things like that\u00a0\nthen I'm going to go in and highlight with this\u00a0\u00a0\nHuda Beauty concealer in praline it's super\u00a0\ncreamy great coverage and y'all it just looks\u00a0\u00a0\nFlawless in photos for foundation I'm going to go\u00a0\nin with the Juvia's place I am magic foundation in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shade Burkina and then I'm going to go in and\u00a0\nspray my face with the airbrush Flawless setting\u00a0\u00a0\nspray amazing I like to use this when I am laying\u00a0\nmy concealers and just all my products in general\nmy foundation brush today y'all is one of my\u00a0\nfavorites it's the morphe 5 m446 I actually\u00a0\u00a0\ngot this from Ulta so I don't think they carry it\u00a0\non morphe's website but it's super dense I showed\u00a0\u00a0\nyou guys the elf brush that is kind of comparable\u00a0\nin that scent so if you're looking for something\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit more affordable I think this one\u00a0\nretails for maybe like 15 to 20. this one retails\u00a0\u00a0\nfor maybe three to six dollars if I'm not mistaken\u00a0\nI'm gonna go ahead and blend out my Foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I have not one Juvia's place in quite some\u00a0\ntime so I'm not really sure we're gonna say and I\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't want to put a lot of foundation on because\u00a0\ntheirs is really thick and last time I remember\u00a0\u00a0\nI got quite oily um so we're gonna\u00a0\nsee just put kind of where I needed it\nand I like the coverage as it is so\u00a0\nI may just be okay with one layer\u00a0\u00a0\nbut we'll see I only squeezed out like\u00a0\nI died and I still have some leftover\u00a0\u00a0\nso it's definitely giving me a nice coverage\u00a0\nthis is um the brightening concealer brush\u00a0\u00a0\nso it's very new it's different because\u00a0\nit has this flat um this flat part right\u00a0\u00a0\nhere so if you look at the old brush that\u00a0\nlooks like this you'll see the difference\nit's actually not bad I wish it was a little\u00a0\nthicker because I am fond of this brush right\u00a0\u00a0\nhere because it's a lot more fluffier um but\u00a0\nthis one definitely gets into those creases\nand I like the way it just Blended that out\nso I decided on a cream blush\u00a0\nI'm gonna go in with the elf's\u00a0\u00a0\num blush in Bali y'all I love this\u00a0\nshade it is super super pigmented\u00a0\u00a0\nand this is honestly one of my favorite\u00a0\ncream blushes um that I actually own\njust blending that um blush out with my\u00a0\nbeauty blender and it's been sitting so\u00a0\u00a0\nit's quite dried out I'm next I'm going to go\u00a0\nin and applying another layer of foundation on\u00a0\u00a0\nmy skin I ended up going in with two layers just\u00a0\nfor extra coverage because this consistency of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe foundation is very thick and then I ended up\u00a0\nalso adding another layer of concealer I always\u00a0\u00a0\nsay that I end up going in and it really\u00a0\njust depends on the day because if I'm not\u00a0\u00a0\nsleeping a lot and things like that I'll add\u00a0\nthree layers um but honestly add those layers\u00a0\u00a0\nunderneath your eyes um if you feel like you got\u00a0\nthe coverage you want with the first layer then\u00a0\u00a0\nleave it I'm just a person that I like a lot\u00a0\nmore coverage underneath the eyes especially\u00a0\u00a0\nsince I'm going to take photos and things\u00a0\nlike that I need that to show up on camera\nforeign\nset I like to go in take my\u00a0\nbeauty blender which is still damp\u00a0\u00a0\num but like I said it's been sitting for\u00a0\na while and I'm just gonna go over my\u00a0\u00a0\nface with it just to make sure everything is\u00a0\nseamlessly Blended I do recommend this step\u00a0\u00a0\nif you are a person that is just now getting\u00a0\ninto foundations or you're just wondering why\u00a0\u00a0\neverything does not look Blended so I'm going\u00a0\nto quickly go in and add just a little bit of\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor to my brows I'm taking the McD luxury\u00a0\ncoat brow pencil in the shade dark brown this\u00a0\u00a0\nto add a little bit like I don't want too much\u00a0\ncolor and I also added a little bit of brow gel\nall right you guys so I ended up going in and\u00a0\njust setting underneath my eyes I'm going to go\u00a0\u00a0\nahead and try this puff right here we are going to\u00a0\nset the eyes I love my beauty blender okay I am a\u00a0\u00a0\nDie Hard what I'm going to do is take my powder\u00a0\nand I'm going to go ahead and I'm gonna take my\u00a0\u00a0\npowder I'm gonna go ahead and take my Spike\u00a0\nto um Pat my hand the back of my hand first\u00a0\u00a0\num and then I'm going to go ahead\u00a0\nand press so we're going to see\nI love the coverage first let's just start\u00a0\noff with that love the coverage that I get\nI am still just going to press it\u00a0\nout as I normally would anyways\nmy bad so on the other side what I'm gonna do\u00a0\nI'm going to use my beauty blender and so I\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to see if I see a difference so I'm going\u00a0\nto take my damp Beauty blender and I'm going to\u00a0\u00a0\npress in on this side that sponge just keep in\u00a0\nmind that was not wet and this is a little down\ny'all see anything look at somebody\u00a0\nI said because I'll see it um\nso first off I definitely do see more coverage on\u00a0\nthis side that I use the triangle sponge and I see\u00a0\u00a0\na lot more of a light application with the beauty\u00a0\nblender which is normally my day-to-day anyways\u00a0\u00a0\num so I mean I see it I definitely see it\u00a0\nwhat y'all think yay no y'all see it or no\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm just gonna add a little bit we're gonna\u00a0\npress it in because I'm going to do my eyeshadow\u00a0\u00a0\nokay I definitely do see the difference amount\u00a0\nof powder that it does apply underneath the eyes\na warmer bronzer any day and I'm taking it like\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm just so happy for gross run with this\u00a0\nI feel like the bronzy chocolate that I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nlooking for will probably be between these\u00a0\ntwo right here or maybe this one's pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I really like these this right here so I\u00a0\nthink I'm leading towards this like a muted\u00a0\u00a0\ngold and like a real nice chocolate bronze so\u00a0\nI'm gonna go ahead and add this warm bronzer\nso I'm taking my bronzer um and honestly there was\u00a0\na shade in the same palette that I'm using that\u00a0\u00a0\ncould have been used as a transition color\u00a0\nI didn't see that until like the end of it\u00a0\u00a0\num so I may do another look um with this\u00a0\npalette um but I'm adding my bronzer\u00a0\u00a0\nand my crease and you can use a transition\u00a0\ncolor of your choice it always just depends\u00a0\u00a0\non your color combination for me I tend to\u00a0\nstick with neutrals which is why I'm using\u00a0\u00a0\num a brown inside the crease to kind of warm it up\u00a0\nnext I'm going to go in and add a chocolate shade\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom the palette and I'm focusing this on the\u00a0\nouter edge of the lid now because we're going to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe doing a spotlight eye which means that we're\u00a0\ngoing to pack that color in the center but that\u00a0\u00a0\nchocolate and smokiness is going to be in the\u00a0\ncorner inner Corner as well as the outer corner\nI'm gonna take that shadow at the bottom corner\u00a0\nand we are going to pack that in the middle of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe lid I'm just using a small Shadow brush to\u00a0\ndo so and I did um spray just a little bit of\u00a0\u00a0\nthat setting spray um on my Shimmer Shadows\u00a0\nI always recommend this um but it definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nhelps with Fallout for number one and then\u00a0\nalso it just helps with the pigmentation\nI'm just adding a little bit more of that\u00a0\nchocolate in the inner Corner as well as the\u00a0\u00a0\nouter just to make sure that it's to my liking I\u00a0\npurposely did not go as dark as I wanted to like\u00a0\u00a0\nI really wanted to go real real dark but I was\u00a0\njust like okay Monet we want to make sure that\u00a0\u00a0\nwe are doing this for an outing and this is\u00a0\nsomething that you really can take from day\u00a0\u00a0\nto night and you can always add black if you\u00a0\nare going for that really really dark smoky\u00a0\u00a0\nnow that I have my look complete I'm going to\u00a0\ngo in with my mascara from Nars you guys this\u00a0\u00a0\nis like one of my favorite mascaras you definitely\u00a0\ndon't have to spend the money if you don't want to\u00a0\u00a0\num these are they are um amazing\u00a0\nproducts and amazing mascaras\u00a0\u00a0\num that are a lower price that will do the\u00a0\nsame job I feel like with mascara you don't\u00a0\u00a0\nnecessarily always have to spend that book\u00a0\nso it's definitely based on your preference\u00a0\u00a0\nlashes I am going in with the first pair in the\u00a0\nfluffy me Clash book um it is restocking shortly\u00a0\u00a0\nactually at the end of December um next I'm going\u00a0\nto go in and add my liner I decided to skip out on\u00a0\u00a0\nmy new liner in the inner wall on the water line\u00a0\nand I'm gonna go in with this Cocoa Brown liner\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom Juvia's place instead and we're just gonna\u00a0\nadd a little bit of smoke on the lower lash line\nso I'm going to add just a little bit of\u00a0\ntranslucent powder underneath the eyes and\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm going to add it in other places of my\u00a0\nface as well but mainly underneath the eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nit definitely helps with catching that Fallout\u00a0\nif you guys are new to shadows and you're just\u00a0\u00a0\nscared I love to use this I do this step\u00a0\non my clients as well as myself so I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing in with that same chocolate brown\u00a0\neyeshadow which is the bottom second and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen I'm going to go in with that bronzer\u00a0\nshade that I use as my transition color\nforeign\nforeign\nand apply my blush today the\u00a0\nblush that I am using is the\u00a0\u00a0\num blush by Juvia's this one is in volume\u00a0\nnumber three it reminds me of Raisin if\u00a0\u00a0\ny'all are familiar with like the Mac raisin\u00a0\nblush y'all will know why I'm obsessed like\u00a0\u00a0\nit's amazing now this pink one I'm not really sure\u00a0\nhow I feel about it but we can definitely mix it\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm just gonna put that on top of oh okay\u00a0\npigments pigmented let's talk about it it's real\u00a0\u00a0\nnice so I don't feel like I'm even gonna mix it\u00a0\nwith the pink because it definitely gave me what\u00a0\u00a0\nI needed in one Swatch so and I'm a blush lover\u00a0\nso okay I see you so I'm going to do the same over\u00a0\u00a0\nhere and I still even though I add a cream blush\u00a0\nI am a blush [\u00a0__\u00a0] so I definitely like to add\u00a0\u00a0\na lot more blush like that's just me\u00a0\nI love to add color back into my face\u00a0\u00a0\num so I have like dimension oh that's really nice\u00a0\nit's very very picky to you guys definitely worth\u00a0\u00a0\nit I think it was like 18 but I caught it on sale\u00a0\nwhen they were having their Black Friday sale so\u00a0\u00a0\nI think I may have got it for like either eight\u00a0\ndollars or ten dollars so definitely not a bad\u00a0\u00a0\ninvestment if you are a beginner or just looking\u00a0\nfor some new blushes all right so I'm gonna sweep\u00a0\u00a0\nthe excess powder off from underneath my eyes\u00a0\nof my face and then I'm going to go ahead and\u00a0\u00a0\nset my face with my powder from makeup forever\u00a0\nI get tons of questions on the powder that I use\u00a0\u00a0\ny'all it makes a amazing difference y'all see\u00a0\nthat like it just covered up underneath my jaw\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so I took my band off of my hair so I'm gonna\u00a0\ngo ahead and add just the other products that that\u00a0\u00a0\nis needed which is pretty much the bronzing cream\u00a0\nand the bronzer so I'm gonna warm my face up super\u00a0\u00a0\nobsessed with the look very obsessed and then I'm\u00a0\ngoing to add a few coats of mascara to my lashes\nforeign so I wanted to do like a natural\u00a0\nnude lip um y'all know how I feel about a\u00a0\u00a0\ngood old glossy nude so I'm going to go\u00a0\nahead and add my chocolate brown liner\nand then I'm going to go in with the\u00a0\nlipstick and latte from MCD luxury Cove\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is my most natural nude like I have\u00a0\na few but I love this for the day to day\u00a0\u00a0\num typically when I don't want to wear any lip\u00a0\ngloss but you know what I say you I feel like\u00a0\u00a0\njust popping off and being glossy so I am going\u00a0\nin um also with a cream gloss but I just didn't\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel like that was a look that I was going for\u00a0\nand my cream glosses just work best with no\u00a0\u00a0\nlipstick so I ended up going back in with these\u00a0\nsugar baby gloss and popping that on and this is\u00a0\u00a0\nthe sugar baby Glitz which is just a little bit\u00a0\nof Sparkle but honestly it's the same formula\u00a0\u00a0\nsuper cute y'all see that you guys so this is\u00a0\nthe finished look I hope you guys enjoyed this\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of get ready with me for the holiday\u00a0\nfestivities let me know if you're going to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe trying this look out be sure to subscribe if\u00a0\nyou haven't and thank

I know your cats refuse to choose your makeup lol but I love seeing you figure out how to make certain products work so I was thinking maybe you can randomly pick two items (like a shadow palette and a lipstick) and build a look around them!

I recently cut bangs to hide the furrow lines.  Brighter lipsticks balance the silver hair, subtle eye shadows because I wear glasses.  I started taking 50+ vitamins going through perimenopause, and now I&#39;m over that hill.  I&#39;ve never had as many compliments on my hair, the &quot;color&quot;, the cut, and my complexion as I&#39;ve had the last three dye free years. Nature really does give us the color we&#39;re supposed to have. I&#39;ve gone to a single, soft shimmer just on my lids as they&#39;re hooded, simple smoked eyeliner, and it works. The shimmer gives a brightness behind my glasses. I still use Double Wear and still get compliments. Basically, we need to do what works for us.  This works for me. I&#39;m still glam, just older and more sparkly.",

I have some liquid foundations but they don&#39;t set on my skin and I stay sticky all day long - even my hair sticks to my face even after using a setting powder!

I found that none of the ones I used have enough coverage: after couple hours my face is red again. Or maybe it will be possible to make a video about proper makeup for us - young ladies at heart \u263a - who suffer from Rosacea? Thank you in advance.",

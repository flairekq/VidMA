You know sometimes when you emulsify cleansers, they either go like way too watery or kind of clump up and get kind of gluggy. It just...ahh...it just feels like wonderful, and it washes off super, super easily as well. I know they have marketed it to remove waterproof makeup and I'm not going to say it doesn't. Because, if you do work at it, it will remove the waterproof makeup. But I did personally find that it does take quite awhile and you do have to rub at your eyes for awhile. Now the type of waterproof mascaras I wear are like really seriously waterproof, cause I use a lot of Japanese waterproof mascaras. Which, like literally, barely anything takes it off. I use my mascara removers, like the \"Heroine Make\" one. So, I would still prefer to use something like that and then use this for the rest of my face. The main oil ingredients are Grape Seed, as well as Sunflower Seed Oil. And it does also include Vitamin E for those antioxidant benefits. It definitely has been a hit for me.

Hyaluronic Acid was in absolutely everything and then we started to try like avoid it, because it's in absolutely everything. And then some people can get like irritated from too much Hyaluronic Acid. I feel like the same thing is happening with Niacinamide.

And the two main ingredients, the first two ingredients, are the exact same. It is way more affordable than this one. It is a way bigger bottle with the same ingredients. And it actually has more of a viscous texture, so it has a bit more of a slip. So, with that one, I know that I can use it more as a Toner or a Serum step. Whereas this one, with the bottle and the texture and everything I get so confused to like when in my routine that I should use it that I just end up not reaching for it. Hence, I did open it a while ago, but I had barely used it, because I just end up reaching for my bigger Essences like this. Unfortunately, it has been a \"Miss\" for me.

But this one, it has seven masks for 770 Japanese yen. With the current exchange rate, it's about 85 US cents per mask. So, super, super affordable. The only thing is, you really can only get it in Japan at the moment. So this one is not something that I would use every single day, because it is quite rich in its essence, but something that I would use on special occasions or when I need that extra boost for my skin the next day. The masks are absolutely drenched in essence that contains Niacinamide, as well as four derivatives of Vitamin C. And it's supposed to help with pore care, brightening, elasticity, and glow. And it definitely does give that instant glow after I've used it. Also, there is so much extra essence in this pouch. When my friend gave it to me she was like, \"After you've used up the sheet mask, there is so much Essence in there, so make sure you put your own sheet mask or cotton in there and you can get like an extra two masks out of it.\" I would definitely recommend it more to Normal and Drier skin types, since it is quite rich and it does contain some Essential Oils as well, just as an FYI.",

I'm gonna compare this to the empowered palette  the crushed flakes is not as flaky um and that's  actually a good thing because normally if you are  doing your eyeshadow you can have a lot of Fallout  so um we are obviously only going to be able to  tell when I do my eye looks to see if there is  enough Fallout or if it's minimal Fallout but  from swatching it I can tell that it doesn't have  much flakiness going on which is actually quite  nice the mats are quite buttery so I can tell  that they're going to blend with ease. I feel the really rich in color so I love that about  this palette and then when it came to the mattes  they're really buttery so it was very easy to  blend and use as transition Shades and then with  the metallic Shimmer so I didn't feel it was as  shimmery as I would have liked it to be in fact  I had to go in with this crushed flake Shadow  here to go over the actual color to intensified  and give it the Shimmer that it needed um with the  crush Flex I really liked the fact that it didn't  have as much Fallout as I was expecting it. overall though this  palette is quite Compact and travel size as you  can see uh pigments are really great but if you're  looking for more versatility then I wouldn't  suggest this palette as I would think that the  shades are very very similar other than that it  really is a very nice palette and I mean it's not  as badly priced considering the brand so I would  really recommend this palette ",

The pigment is definitely  buildable and it starts off pretty sheer. I feel like it gives a really pretty, not  exactly natural, but it gives a nice blush.  I have oily skin so I prefer powder blushes.  They just work better with my skin. Looking  at this blush in terms of packaging it is a  little disappointing. Although it's not super  lightweight, there's not a heavy weight that's  kind of expected from luxury brands. Also it's  super small. Tiny product and basically fits  right in the palm of my hand. I know blush  can take a while to get through even if you're  wearing it on a daily basis, it still could take  years to finish. But for the price that's pretty  disappointing. The powder is definitely smooth  and looks really good on the skin. There's also  a light floral scent. I really only smell it when  I'm picking up color on the brush. I would prefer  it to be unscented but thankfully it's not too  noticeable and definitely doesn't last that long. In terms of longevity, I would say it  has decent staying powder. I can usually tell that  the color is still there about six hours later and  then after that it does start to fade. You do have  to build up color with this product.",

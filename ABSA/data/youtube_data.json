        "transcript_text": "- Hello, my lovelies, and Happy New Year.\nToday, it's all about the\nbest affordable makeup of 2021\nfrom my rendition, my opinion, my makeup\nthat I just kept going\ntowards, kept reaching towards,\nand I just couldn't get enough of.\nSome of them are newer products,\neither the beginning of the year, mid,\nor even towards the end of the year,\nand then some of them are\njust rediscovered loves.\nLet's begin, starting\nfirst with the primer.\nThis right here is by e.l.f.\nI don't usually like primers,\nbut this one I actually\n(laughs) really, really enjoyed.\nThis is their Oil Control\nLiquid Lotion with tea tree oil.\nThis might put you off\nif you have dry skin,\nbut I found that this just helped balance\nthe oil throughout the\nday, especially in a humid,\nwarm, hot climate,\ndefinitely towards the\nspring and summertime,\nbut I really enjoyed this\nthroughout the entire year,\nand I would mostly focus in areas\nwhere I would get extra shiny,\nlike right here, the T-zone,\nor just even use it all over my face\nif I knew it was gonna be\nreally hot and humid that day.\nand it also smells really nice.\nbut it doesn't really mattify you.\nIt just gives a really nice, clean base\nto begin your makeup.\nThis does have a little\nbit of a tackiness,\nso I find that my\nmakeup, it adheres better\nwith this lotion/primer, but\nI really enjoyed this product,\nand like I said, don't\nlet it steer you away\nif you have super dry skin.\nJust make sure you prep your\nskin with your skincare,\nand then use this on top\nbefore you apply your makeup.\nFor foundation, this was the product\nthat just kept me excited to\nuse it over and over again.\nThis is the L'Oreal True\nMatch Hyaluronic Tinted Serum.\nI'm in Shade 0.5 to two.\nThis right here is not like\nyour typical foundation,\nwhere it gives you a\ncrazy amount of coverage,\nbut something about this,\nit gives you the coverage.\nIt gives you that beautiful,\nhealthy look to your skin\nwithout making it look shiny,\noily throughout the day,\nand it's just a beautiful product.\nbut I do like to wear this on its own,\nand I do like the dropper.\nYou can apply it with your fingers,\nbut I actually really like\na dampened sponge with this,\nand it just blends so nicely.\nAnd it somehow it looks like your skin,\nbut giving a really good, light coverage\nand just color correcting everything.\nI love the way this\nproduct looks on my skin.\nIf my skin's having a good day, a bad day,\nI find that this just looks\ngreat regardless. (laughs)\nI love this for an everyday\ntype of a base, it's phenomenal.\nThe very first time I looked\nat it and reviewed it,\nin the packaging, in the\nbottle, it looks iridescent.\nIt looks like it has this\npearly, glittery finish,\nbut I don't know, somehow,\nmagically, it looks incredible,\nand it just gives you the\nperfect amount of radiance\nto your skin without looking\nlike a highlighter or an\nilluminator, because in the bottle,\nit looks very much so\ntowards the highlighter, illuminator,\nlike an illuminator for your skin.\nThis product, I can't get enough of it.\nOkay, let's move on to brows, Winky Lux.\nI don't know how many times\nI've repurchased this pencil,\nbut this particular\npencil, it's the micro one.\nand this is their universal shade.\nYou have a little spoolie on one end,\nand then you have the\npencil on the other end.\nJust something about the formula,\nthe way it applies, the way it blends,\nthe way lasts all day long, and the color,\nit's really, really great.\nIt's one of my favorite\npencils from the drugstore.\nIt's not the cheapest,\nbut I really, really, really enjoyed\nthis pencil in 2021.\nSo for a brow gel,\nI don't like many brow\ngels from the drugstore.\nI find that they're either too waxy\nand they just make your brows fall down,\nespecially if you have stubborn brows,\nor they just don't do anything, honestly.\nI do like this one.\nThis is a newer one from the drugstore.\nThis is by NYX, this\nis their The Brow Glue.\nIf you like the laminated\neffect for your brows,\nyou might really enjoy this,\nbut I find that you have\nto work in layers with this product.\nFirst, do a really light layer.\nGive it a little bit of time\nto get tacky and dry down,\nand then go in with a\nvery light second layer\non top to really comb\nand give your brows\nthe shape you want them\nto last all day long,\nand this product, it stays\non my brows all day long.\nAnd it gives just the perfect\namount of crusty brows,\n(laughs) even though we\ndon't like crusty brows,\nbut with this type of a product,\nyou will get a little bit.\nOkay, so for concealers,\nit's the same thing with an eyebrow gel.\nThere were a lot of concealers\nthat I used from the drugstore,\nbut they were more of the\nL'Oreal Infallible concealer,\nthe Cover Girl concealer,\nthe Maybelline Age Rewind\nConcealer, classic,\nbut this right here, I have to say,\never since I tried it,\nI can't stop using it.\nThe NYX Bear with Me Concealer Serum,\nand there is a reason why it went viral.\nIt's a good concealer.\nNot just good, it's a\nphenomenal concealer.\nI am in the shade Vanilla,\nand it's the perfect color\nfor me, which is very rare,\nespecially from the drugstore.\nI feel like I have to really\ncreate my own concoctions,\n(laughs) not even from the drugstore.\nI have two shades I (laughs) usually use,\nAnd I like to use my fingers first\nto get it where I want it to be,\nit's so lightweight, but it\nstill provides you coverage.\nIt's super lightweight under the eyes.\nIt looks so pretty.\nIt's so stretchy and fluid,\nwhere it just goes\nwhere you want it to go.\nYou have no issues blending\nthis concealer out at all,\nbut it lasts all day long.\nIt doesn't really crease under the eyes.\nIt doesn't make your\nunder-eyes look weird, crepey,\ndry, or oily, somehow. (laughs)\nIt just looks really,\nreally nice under the eyes,\nand I like to apply it with a brush first\nand then go in with a sponge if I need to.\nYou don't have to set this concealer,\nbut I find that, if you\nhave an eye mask underneath\nor an eye moisturizer underneath, I like\nto set it just a little bit\nusing a loose finishing powder,\nand this right here, I\nhave rediscovered in 2021,\nthe Maybelline Fit Me in shade\nnumber 10, or Fair Light.\nIt's perfect for my skin tone.\nI like that it has a little bit\nmore of a neutral undertone,\nand I like to use a little\nbrush to work it in there\nand do a very light dusting\nover this concealer.\nAnd I'll focus it most\nright under the eyes\nif I'm wearing mascara right\nhere so it doesn't smudge\nor it doesn't move and transfer.\nAnd this setting powder,\nit's just a really good setting powder.\nA little goes a long way.\nIt never makes my skin\nlook crepey, dried out.\nI feel like it looks\nreally good all day long.\nFor eyeshadow primer,\nthere were two that I used,\nMilani and Wet N Wild, either one.\nBoth are very, very similar,\nbut I feel like I used the\nMilani a little bit more.\nHas a thicker consistency to it,\noh, that's too much,\nand it looks like it's\ngoing to color correct\nor add some kind of coverage,\nbut it really doesn't.\nIt just gives a really nice base\nto your eyelids for your eyeshadow.\nIt does blend out really nice.\nIt's not super, super thick, like a paste.\nIt just warms up.\nFor eyeshadows, there\nweren't too many standouts\nthat I used throughout the year,\nbut this is the one brand\nI just kept coming back to\nin these two shades.\nThis is the e.l.f., their\nBite-Sized eyeshadow palette.\nI like Truffles and Rose Water.\nVery versatile, different\nlooks you can create.\nJust very easy eyeshadows to work with.\nVery pigmented, blendable.\nThey stay on all day with a\nreally good eyeshadow primer,\nand they're just phenomenal,\nespecially for the price.\nYou can't beat them.\nI'm gonna take my finger\nand go in with this beautiful metallic.\nIt's a beautiful, pewter, taupey shade.\nI'm gonna take a small...\nOoh, geez, that went all over my shirt.\n(laughing) That's great, whoops.\nI'm gonna take this shadow right here\non a small little fluffy brush\nand work that into the crease\nand just help blend it all together,\nsoften it up a little bit.\nI'm gonna take a little bit\nmore of that metallic shade\non a little brush\n(bottle spritzes)\nand get it wet.\nI want a little bit more intensity.\nFor eyeliner, I feel\nlike, if it was a gel,\nI either stuck with Milani or Revlon.\nI really like Milani,\ntheir Stay Put eyeliner,\nhonestly, in any shade\nthat they have available,\nbut I'm gonna use, today, After\nDark, which is number one.\nIt's just a nice matte black eyeliner,\nand this one, I like\nthat it's super creamy.\nIt has that kohl consistency\nmixed in with gel,\nbut it stays put once it sets,\nand I do like to work one eye at a time\njust because, like I said,\nonce it sets, it sets,\nand I'm just using an angled brush\nto give a nice wing\nFor mascara primer, classic,\nL'Oreal Voluminous Primer.\nI rediscovered it this year\nagain, and it's just good.\nGets the job done.\nI do like to let it get tacky a little bit\nbefore the mascara to\ngive it some kind of grip,\nbut it's just a classic mascara primer.\nFor mascara, this should\nbe no surprise, (laughs)\nMaybelline Lash Sensational mascara.\nI've tried so many new mascaras\nfrom the drugstore this past year,\nand I found myself just\ngoing back to this one\nand just comparing\neverything to this mascara.\nIt doesn't smudge on me,\nit doesn't transfer, it doesn't flake.\nIt can flake if it's a very,\nvery old tube, (laughs)\njust like any other mascara,\nbut just something about this,\nit's so easy to layer and to build volume,\nbut it also separates your lashes\nand it also lengthens your\nlashes at the same time,\nand I think it is definitely\nbecause of the wand,\nbecause of the bristles, the\nway the bristles are shaped.\nI really enjoy this mascara.\nFor cream bronzer, this\nhas to be no secret,\ne.l.f. Putty Bronzer in Tan Lines.\nIt's just such a good (laughs)\nproduct, it's so good.\nIt's one of my favorites\nfrom the drugstore,\nfrom pro-grade pricing to luxury.\nIt's just so good.\nThe only thing I will complain about is,\nif you're using a bigger brush,\nI wish this pot was a\n(laughs) little bigger,\nbut you can use a smaller brush like this,\nand it fits perfectly in here.\nI like this color.\nI like the way it blends.\nI like that it's buildable,\ndepending on how much product you pick up.\nI like that you can use it with a brush.\nI like that you can use\nit with a dampened sponge,\nwith your fingers.\nI mean, you can just do so many things\nwith this little product right here,\nand I actually do like\nthe size of this product\nbecause it's a great for traveling,\nbut it's also great to\nkeep in your makeup bag,\nand it doesn't take up too much space.\nIt's so good, and I like\nto stamp this product on with a brush.\nAnd I do use it to actually\ncarve my cheekbones out\nAnd my face because I find that the color,\nit's that perfect warmth,\nbut neutral, where it doesn't\nlook dirty on my skin,\nand I do like to layer this product\ninstead of going really\nheavy handed with it,\njust layer it and just place in areas\nwhere I need a little bit of definition.\nI feel like e.l.f., in 2021,\nreally stepped up their game\nwith their CC Cream,\nwith their bronzer, their blushes,\nI mean, their highlighters, their primers.\nThey did a really good job.\nFor cream blush, e.l.f., their\nPutty Blush in shade Tahiti.\nIt looks intimidating,\nbut just on the skin, it looks so pretty,\nand again, I like to apply this\nwith more of a dense foundation brush.\nI'm just gonna work it into the brush\nand just start tapping this.\n2021 was the year of cream\nproducts for my skin,\nfor my blush, for my\ncontour, for my bronzer,\nfor the highlighter,\nbut I do like to top it\nwith a powder product on\ntop just to add longevity.\nBut you can see, just\nworking a tiny little bit,\nit just brings back life onto my cheeks,\nbut in just that perfectly, I don't know.\nThis blush right here is so\neasy to work with and layer.\nFor my powder, contour/bronzer, Juvia's Place.\nThis has a special place in my heart.\nThis is their bronzer\npalette in shade Light.\nI like that I can use\nthis for my skin tone\nwhen I'm pale and when I have\na little bit more of a tan,\nbut I do like to actually\nmix the two shades together\njust to get more of a\ncustom shade for my skin.\nThis powder is just so easy to work with.\nI love the tones.\nI like how soft and buttery\nand how blendable, how\nbuildable the shades are,\njust so easy to work with,\nand I've used this with\nso many different bases,\nand it just works with everything.\nI haven't found one product\nthat it hasn't worked with.\nFor my powder blush, this is the one\nin this particular shade.\nMilani, and this is their Powder Blush\nin shade number 11, Blossomtime Rose.\nI have, I think, two\nbackups (laughs) of this\nbecause I love it so much.\nIt has, I don't know if you can\neven see with the light,\nit has this iridescent,\ntwo-dimensional tone to it.\nIt's peachy, it's rosy.\nIt's so stunning with hint\nof a little bit of a gold sheen to it.\nIt's so pretty. \nOh my gosh, it's so pretty,\nand it's so easy to use,\nand just the way it sits\non top of my cheeks,\nit doesn't exaggerate anything,\nbut it just adds something\nspecial to my cheekbones\non top of any blush.\nFor highlighter, Catrice\nMore Than Glow highlighter\nin shade number 20, Supreme Rose Beam.\nThis right here, it's such\nan oldie, but a goodie,\nand it's just one of my favorites.\nI find that it gives the perfect iciness\nand a highlighter look to\nyour face without looking dry,\nwithout exaggerating any\nkind of texture on my skin,\nand I do like this color, as well.\nIt's definitely a little\nbit more icy and pink\nand more cool-toned,\nbut I find that a little goes a long way\nand it really balances out\neverything else on my face.\nLet's say my cheeks look a little warm.\nIt balances everything out,\nand it's a very easy highlighter to use.\nI mean, you can make it\nlook super wet and dewy,\nor you can really just tone it down.\nI like to use it with a brush first\nand then go in with my dampened sponge.\nI mean, look at that, that's insane.\nDefinitely looks very wet and\ndewy on the skin with a brush,\nbut just to help melt everything together,\njust go in with a dampened sponge,\nand just tap right on top.\nSo for lips, I was really\nthinking to myself,\n\"What were the products that\nI used most consistently\n\"and the shades or whatever else?\"\nI tried so many lip products\nout from the drugstore,\nfrom luxury down to mid-grade,\nand I found that, this past year,\nhaving Emorett and just wanting\nto just cuddle and kiss him,\nI didn't wear too many lip\nproducts besides a good lip liner\nand either a lip gloss,\na lip oil, or a lip balm.\nThat's (laughs) what I\nreally gravitated towards\non an everyday basis, so for\nlip liners from the drugstore,\nthese two are here on my\nfavorites in these shades.\nThe first one is by NYX,\nand this right here is their lip pencil\nin shade N Truffle.\nI like this one so much.\nI repurchased this one so many times.\nIt's just a really good\neveryday neutral beige lip liner\n(laughs) that you can\ngo really intense with\nto just outline and\nreally color in your lips,\nor just do really soft\nstrokes on your lips\nand just get the most\nminimal amount of color,\nbut your lips still look\nreally beautiful, defined,\nand just full of life.\nAnd then the other one, this\nright here is by Milani.\nThis is their Color Statement Lipliner\nin shade number four, All Natural.\nI find that this one's\na little bit more rosy\ninstead of more n and\nmore beigey with the NYX.\nIt just depends\nwhat kind of lip statement\nyou wanna go with,\nbut I find that these two lip pencils,\nthe formula is really stunning.\nThey last all day long,\nand they're very easy to\npair with so many lip colors,\ndepending what color you're going with.\nI think, today, probably go with,\nI don't even know, either one. (laughs)\nMore pink or more beige?\n- Go more pink.\n- Let's go more pink.\nLet's go with Milani.\nHonestly, I would just go like this,\nAnd just really softly blend it\nto the center of my lips,\nbut it's like my lip color,\nbut a little bit warmer and deeper.\nFor lip gloss, (laughs) this right here is\nwhat I really liked from the drugstore.\nIt's the Milani\nand it's their Keep It Full,\ntheir Maxxx Nourishing Lip Plumper.\nI really like this one a lot.\nI love how big (laughs) and jumbo this is,\nand I like the shade 110, Little Secret.\nIt has a good amount of pigment to it.\nI like the smell.\nI like the sensation that it gives.\nIt's not super, super plumping,\nwhere it just feels\nuncomfortable, but it makes\nyour lips just look really\nluscious and delicious. (laughs)\nAnd that completes\nmy Affordable Best of Makeup 2021.\nI love all of these products.\nSome of them were new\nlaunches, new releases,\nbut they've just been a\nstaple in my makeup routine,\nand then others, I've just rediscovered\nor just kept using over the years\nand there's nothing to\nreplace them (laughs) with.\nI'm gonna leave it here.\nThank you for watching,\nspending time with me,\nand I'll see you in the next one\nvery soon, and Happy 2022.\nSo exciting, bye. (Blows kiss)",

        "transcript_text": "[Music]\nhi i'm peyton list and i'm going to walk\nyou guys through my skincare routine and\nmy blushy pinky girls day makeup my\nfirst step is the cerave hydrating\nfacial cleanser\ni use this every day i mean tic toc\nhelped me discover it but then also my\nboyfriend's shower because\nhe uses it and i started using it and my\nskin started getting a little bit better\nand he was like oh maybe it's on\nsomething i'm also breaking out pretty\nbad right now i think it's from the mass\nand also just hormonal acne i just when\ni get stressed or tired or whatever i\ni'm trying to figure it out at this\npoint i just know that my body reacts\nand it's super sensitive and i just\nembrace it and i just try to be kind to\nit and myself because i think\nstressing about it\nisn't going to do anything\nnext i go for my dmk accumist\nis clinical active serum\nholy hendrickson eye cream\ni've started using eye cream\nevery morning underneath my makeup i\nfeel like my makeup just settles on\nbetter so for my lips usually\ni i was using a lip scrub but then i got\nreally desperate one day and i didn't\nhave my lip scrub and i realized just\nputting hot water on a washcloth and\njust kind of going in it exfoliates\nmy mom she really cares about skincare\nand makeup my mom worked for bobby brown\num\nwhen before i was born so she was always\nreally into makeup and taught me a lot\nand i would lock the bathroom door and i\nwould steal all my mom's makeup i\nremember the first time she really\ncaught me was i had stolen a blush\nand i had just put it on to the extreme\nbecause i just thought like flushed\nblushy cheeks were so beautiful\nand she saw me coming out of school and\nshe laughed at me because i just looked\nlike a complete clown i've always loved\nmakeup i really have next i'm going by\npaw paw ointment\n[Music]\ni like to keep it simple with my\nskincare routine i think i used to be a\n30 40 step person my skin routine took\nso long and then i realized that it was\njust making my skin worse it was\nbreaking me out more i didn't need all\nof it i feel like every part of my face\nhas a different texture you know i'm\nbreaking out on my chin but my cheeks\nare more dry and my forehead's more dry\nand it doesn't break out there so i'll\nend up using different products\ndepending on the zone\nof my face which took me a long time to\nlearn my oil-free moisturizer with spf i\nput it on every day because\ni just am so fair and i think sun\nprotection is so important\nthey say you can really tell someone's\nage from the back of their hands\nand i always think about that so i apply\nto spf but i usually apply like a lot of\nfacial products all over my body i\nalways get the advertisements for um\nbooty masks and i was like\nwell if they're selling booty masks\nshouldn't you be able to use your face\nmask on your booty so i started just\nusing like face masks on random parts of\nmy body and just like using the products\neverywhere working in a makeup trailer\nor working with these artists i always\npick their brain i sit down and i'm just\nlike what's your favorite okay we'll buy\nthis moisturizer what what's your brow\ntrick i really enjoy beauty and i love\nthe process and\nwhen going into a character i feel like\nthey make my face look so different each\ntime so two foundations one liquid\nbronzer um this is the giorgio armani\nluminous silk and then the shiseido\nsynchro skin\ni've tried so many foundations\nand this is my favorite i love it it\ncovers up acne but also makes my skin\nlook glowy and it still looks like skin\ni just dab\nall over especially when\ncovering acne\n[Music]\ni definitely did my makeup for red\ncarpets growing up oh my gosh there are\nsome photos that haunt me\num i got a really terrible spray can\nonce\nand it was patchy\nand my foundation was white and my body\nwas orange and it just looked\nabsolutely horrible and i just have to\nlaugh at because when you come into the\nindustry as a kid\nyou're obviously gonna have so many\nmistakes\nand now i just have to look back at it\nand laugh i actually went to my mom one\nday and i was like why\nwhy did you let me wear my hair like\nthat or my makeup or that outfit or\nwhatever she was like you liked it i\nliked it at the time one of my favorite\nsteps brows the anastasia beverly hills\npencil and then the mac eyebrow fiber\ngel on most days when i'm just\nyou know\ngoing to train or\nhave a chill day i'll just use the brush\nnever seen my brows look so good brush\nthem up as much as you can\nand then\nwhile they're brushed up\nif you see the spots\nfill in the spots then brush them back\ndown\ni've dyed my hair blonde for a long time\nand\nonce they dyed my hairbond and they put\nthe dye on my brows they left the\ncolor on my brows too long and they took\nit off and i had no brows left um they\nwere just bleached so i was kind of\nahead of the bleached brow trend but it\nwas not in that you know\ngrowing up i did start you know i had\nall these adults who were\nmuch older than me doing my hair makeup\nand i had to sort of learn how to voice\nmy opinion and say okay no i know we\ncannot touch my hair\nor my face with that product or whatever\nit is because i know it's going to\ndamage it and it was hard to\nto find my voice in that and i always\nthought that you know women seemed\ndifficult and i realized it's okay to\nprotect yourself because no one else is\nthere to do it and at the end of the day\ni'm the one going home and i'm the only\none left with me and my hair's falling\nout of my head and my eyebrows fell off\ni had to learn you know how to defend\nmyself and realize i'm not being\ndifficult i'm not being hard to work\nwith now my hair is healthier and that's\nbecause of me like because i have taken\ngood care of it and i've had to learn\nand\nwork with people who are who are kind\nnow and just like make sure that i have\na really solid team around me\n[Music]\nthese are my player palettes um from my\nmakeup brand play beauty to me just has\ncreated so many different characters i\nlike to have fun with color and like\nexpress myself through makeup and\nwhatever i'm feeling that day or like a\nlot of the times\ni just want to be someone else when i\nwhen i do my makeup and you know i'll be\nlike doing\nauditions or whatever it is or meetings\nand i get to just like\nbe something\nfun shimmery pink\nthat's right here\n[Music]\ni might do a little bit of this shimmery\npink\noh yeah that's okay i'm gonna do that in\nthe corner of my\ni like to slowly you know just take a\nlittle bit at a time and just\nslowly build and pat\ni do usually do\nmy makeup with my girlfriends around\nthat is my favorite time to do makeup\nbecause makeup is not a chore it's a fun\nthing especially if we're going out\ntogether i love getting ready together\nlike i love doing my girlfriend's eye\nmakeup i live in a house that was built\nin the 30s\nand it's a very tiny guest bedroom i\ndon't even think someone could really\nlive in it so i just turned it into a\nmakeup room\nand\nuh like the closet is filled with\nclothes from characters or things i've\ntaken from set which is really fun and\nthen like it's just all my makeup and we\njust hang out in there and play music\nreally loud i like to do my concealer\nafter my eye makeup this is the ysl\num concealer pen which i like because\nit's easy to just\nthrow in your purse\ni just prefer a brush i just like the\nway\nit blends so nicely\ni definitely used to use makeup as a\nform of covering up and i would say my\nin my teenage years i definitely wanted\nto be\nolder i wanted to be perceived\ndifferently it's so funny looking back\nand thinking about how insecure i would\nget and i'd be one of those people that\nsaid i'm not leaving the house without\nmy makeup\ni think quarantine probably helped us\nall you know just realizing how\nimportant underneath is and skin care\nand i think my relationship with makeup\nhas\nturned into something that\ni really prefer and love now it's more\nof a form of expression and\ni just feel so good when i wear it i\nreally love how with campaigns now\nyou know people have their acne out\npeople have their imperfections because\nthis level of perfection that we've been\nstriving for for so long you know the\noverly filtered overly edited retouched\nphotos it's just too much pressure and\nit's not realistic i found this closest\nbronzer at sephora so just like clean\ncruelty free and i'm\ni'm trying to introduce more of that\ninto my makeup bag\ni'm going with the play one stop pop\nblush the next c color which i think i'm\ngonna i might mix it with\nthe pure bliss color this one's a little\nlight\nand i just smile\nand i go just like above the apples of\nmy cheeks\ni\nsaw a trick recently i think it was on\ntick-tock to just\num\ngo with your blush in the areas where\nyou normally highlight and it really\nlifts\nand i really like it\nhighlighter stick\nso next i'm gonna go with my mascara the\ntoo faced better than sex\nmascara\ni'll go in the corner um just sort of\ntry lifting\nso this is a\nreally hydrating tinted lip balm and\nit's strawberry jam and i love that\nthey're all fruit flavored\nmy tatcha\nsilk powder i love tatcha i love their\nskincare products i love all their\nproducts\ni love dewy skin i love it to look glowy\nbut in the right places but i also just\nkind of like set the tone that way and\nthen if i sweat throughout the day i\nreally don't care like i think makeup is\nmeant to be lived in i'm not constantly\ntrying to fix it like i do it and i try\nto do it as best as i can but then i\nwant to live throughout the day and i\ndon't really care my makeup comes off\nand then i finish it off with the super\ngoop\ndefense refresh spray and i love that it\nhas some protection in it\ni'm all done with makeup and i didn't\nwash my hair last night or the day\nbefore i like to wash my hair at least\nnot possible i just throw it up in um a\ncap\nso i'm going to go in with my kerastase\nuh dry shampoo\nlaplace bonding oil\nso i'm gonna go in on the

        "transcript_text": "- Hi, I'm Brooke Shields,\nand I wanna know, do you\nwanna go to bed with me?\n(gentle upbeat music)\nNow for this particular nighttime routine\nI am going to be using\nfive different products.\nSo the first thing that I'm\ngoing to do is remove my makeup.\nSo this ginger turmeric, turmeric,\nnot quite sure how to say it.\nIt's a True Botanicals Cleansing Balm.\nAnd what I love about this balm\nis that is rich and creamy,\nbut does not leave a greasy residue.\nSo I put, I have makeup on right now,\nso I'm going to put it all over my face\nand my lips.\nI'm not scared of it, even on my eyes.\nAnd then I will take a little\nbio-friendly pad, 'cause I don't use\nthe cotton pads anymore, and warm water.\nI put it on the pad, hold it\nbetween my fingers like this\nand do the first layer of removal,\nand you will see how it\ntakes it off immediately.\nI used to use very, very hot water.\nI have a tendency to have\nmore dry skin than oily skin,\nso that's what I love about this cleanser\nis it really keeps your face moisturized.\nAnd I usually finish\nwith just a regular wash cloth that I wet.\nAnd my mother always used to say,\nmoisturizer and cleanser,\nkeeping your face clean.\nShe used to say soap and water,\nand so I used to use bubbly soap\nbecause I thought that that\nsqueaky, dry skin feeling\nmeant that my face was very clean.\nBut because of this, if\nyou notice, just warm water\nliterally took off all the makeup\nand you can see how\nclean it makes your face.\nBut it doesn't make your face feel oily,\nand it doesn't dry it out,\nthat sort of really dry,\nthat kind of dry feeling\nthat I find some soaps do.\nSometimes I have to say I...\nOkay, so I had my eyelashes dyed,\nso they look like they are still dark,\nbut I have been known to go to sleep\nwith not taking my eye makeup\noff, which is really bad.\nBut sometimes if I wear\na waterproof mascara,\nI don't take the time at night,\nbut that's not good for you.\nAlthough I do look at this routine now,\nwhereas I used to look at it as a chore\nthat I had to do for just,\nfor my work or for something,\nnow I look at it as really\nself-care, and the ritual of it\nbefore I go to sleep at\nnight is actually calming.\nSo you saw the first one,\nwhich was the cleanser.\nThe next one is the Chebula,\nwhich is an unbelievable\nactive ingredient,\nand it's called Immunity Serum.\nAnd I'm going to take this,\nit's in a little dropper\nalso by True Botanicals.\nAnd I'm going to put it\nin my hand like this,\nand then I am going to take\nthis Vitamin C Booster.\nNow, when it's in this powder form,\nit stays active and fresh a lot longer\nthan when it's already in a product.\nSo what they did was they separated it out\nand then Vitamin C Booster\nis really just like,\nthis will stay potent until\nthe last little drop of powder\nis taken out of this jar.\nSo, I will put a little bit in like that.\nI mix them together like that.\nI mix them together.\nIt dissolves entirely.\nYou can put it in with the oil,\nbut I like to put it in with the serum\nbecause I feel like it gets\na little closer to my face\nor my skin, or my...\nI don't know, somehow I just like,\nI like the way it feels in the serum.\nSo I put it everywhere.\nBut my mom always said,\nit's good to give\nyourself a little facial.\nLittle teeny facial every night.\nIt doesn't get tacky or\nsticky, but I can feel like,\noh, now I can feel that I\ncan put another product on it\nbecause my skin is already\nstarting to absorb the serum.\nSo I just use the second\nand third with the booster.\nThe fourth product that I'm going to use\nis the Pure Radiance\nOil by True Botanicals.\nAnd look at that color,\nI love the color of that,\nand the smell is just heavenly.\nThis Radiance Oil smells like jasmine,\nit has neroli I think it is,\nor neroli, and then rose.\nI put that all over my face, my lips,\nmy nose, even on top of my eyes.\nSometimes my daytime is a little\nquicker than my nighttime.\nI spend a little bit more time\nat night taking off my makeup\nbecause usually it's being\nout and out in the elements\nall day and also I've had makeup on,\nso I spend more time at night.\nI see a couple of dermatologists,\none mostly for like\nsunspots and for mole checks\nand cancer, things like that, and Fraxel.\nAnd then I see another\none who does like more\nspot therapy and light therapy on my skin.\nAnd I'm willing to try anything.\nThe last product that\nI'm going to be using\nis called Resurrection Radiance Eye Cream.\nNow, I love an eye cream.\nThis one is delicious.\nIt's just, it's thick without\nbeing greasy, it is...\nI like to put a little bit on my hand\nand I like to warm it up a little bit,\nand the warmth somehow\ndissipates it much more smoothly.\nAnd I pat first like that.\nAnd then sometimes if I'm\nin the mood in the morning,\nI usually take one of my little tools\nand then go like that with it\n'cause my eyes kind of can get puffy.\nThey get puffy very\neasily. I have allergies.\nIf I was going to a desert island,\nwell, I would have to bring a product\nthat had a sunscreen in it. (chuckles)\nBut if I was going to\nbe on a desert island,\nI think the thing that I would want\nthe most is the Radiance Oil.\nBecause it can be used on\nmy hair, it can be used...\nI sometimes put it on my lips,\nI definitely put it on my eyebrows\nand I feel like I could\nuse multipurpose with it.\nAlthough I do really love this eye cream,\nI might have to sneak the eye\ncream in to my little sack\nthat I'm taking to the island. (laughs)\nThere's so many trends right now\nit's hard to keep track of them.\nI haven't seen anything\nthat's really crazy.\nI mean, I remember hearing that for bags\npeople were putting\nPreparation H under their eyes.\nI have not tried it, but I\nguess it takes down swelling,\n(laughs) so maybe I\nshould try it. (laughs)\nThat was probably the craziest,\nthe craziest thing that I've ever heard.\nYeah, so I feel like now my face\njust feels so moisturized.\nIt feels like it's gotten\na little attention,\nbut it also feels so\nclean but not dry, so.\nSo, that is it.\nYou can see how healthy and moisturized\nand ready to go to bed my face is.\nSo, come on, let's go to bed.",

Using a brush that you have a bit more control with will allow you to have more control over the blending and placement of the colors.  hope this helps!\u263a\ufe0f"

subscribing so\u00a0\u00a0\ntoday i'm going to be testing some makeup i've\u00a0\nwanted to test for the longest time the it's not\u00a0\u00a0\nit's not majorly pricey but it's not cheap either\u00a0\nand to be honest i was like i wanted to try\u00a0\u00a0\nquite a bit from the range and i couldn't\u00a0\nafford it so i waited until the january sales\u00a0\u00a0\nand i managed to get my hands on some\u00a0\nreal bargains so the company is cc as\u00a0\u00a0\nyou'll probably see from the title and they do\u00a0\nthe most stunning makeup in the world i think\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah it is absolutely beautiful there's so much\u00a0\non the website i was really tempted by the alice\u00a0\u00a0\nin wonderland palettes but looking at the color\u00a0\nstories i thought no i've got loads of colors like\u00a0\u00a0\nthat i'm gonna i'm gonna steer myself away from\u00a0\nthose and i'm gonna go for something different\u00a0\u00a0\nso with that in mind i picked up i got four items\u00a0\nso it's not a full face i've already done most\u00a0\u00a0\nof my base but i got the highlighter which is\u00a0\nthis one here there's loads of highlighters on\u00a0\u00a0\nthere i just picked out this one this is the\u00a0\nliving colorfully dreamland highlight powder\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is the packaging so it's quite basic\u00a0\npackaging but really really sleek and classy i\u00a0\u00a0\nlove this kind of matte rose gold is it rose gold\u00a0\nnot really it's more of a champagne but yeah gold\u00a0\u00a0\nand then inside we have this highlighter just\u00a0\nlook at that look at that detail it is beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\ni'll be honest i don't know if this is\u00a0\ngoing to be a little bit too dark for me\u00a0\u00a0\nbut we'll find out when i try it it's not too\u00a0\nbad it's it's like oh you can actually see that\u00a0\u00a0\nit's um it's like a really nice champagney color\u00a0\nso we may be all right actually so i got that\u00a0\u00a0\nand that was 10 pounds in the sale i'll link\u00a0\nall the products in the description box below\u00a0\u00a0\nfor you if you want to check them out yourself\u00a0\nthen i picked up the setting spray so it's the\u00a0\u00a0\nliving colorfully lasting makeup setting spray\u00a0\nso the packaging is like this very very pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nlike nice iridescent finish on it and then\u00a0\nthis is the spray so it's one of the you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow the ones which is where it got like the\u00a0\nsparkly swirly a bit like the iconic one look\npretty yeah this was this was a\u00a0\nturner as well actually bargain\u00a0\u00a0\nthen i grabbed the i got two products from the\u00a0\nbritish british museum range so this is the luxury\u00a0\u00a0\nsatin lipstick i do like a satin lipstick in\u00a0\nthe shade 306 which i believe is like a deep red\u00a0\u00a0\ni did pick a pink one because i wanted to go for\u00a0\nsomething a bit different to what i normally do\u00a0\u00a0\num but unfortunately they contacted me and said\u00a0\nthat they didn't stock any more of those so\u00a0\u00a0\nthey said did i want to change and i picked this\u00a0\none so that's fine you know these things happen\u00a0\u00a0\nbut the packaging looks like\u00a0\nthis so it's like an egyptian\u00a0\u00a0\ncat so pretty it's good quality packaging as well\u00a0\ni will say and then we've got the branding on the\u00a0\u00a0\ntop there with the british museum and then look\u00a0\nat this i'll put it up all the way this is the\u00a0\u00a0\nlipstick itself so we've got like high lip is it\u00a0\nkind of graphics highla graphics hydra no not high\nhilographics oh what is it well according\u00a0\nto google it's hieroglyphs there we go\u00a0\u00a0\nso yeah it's got egyptian hieroglyphs on it so\u00a0\nyeah and it's a really nice shade of red as well\u00a0\u00a0\nand then in the top we've got the zc logo as\u00a0\nwell it's a really nice shape as well actually\u00a0\u00a0\ni like how it's tapered i'd\u00a0\nimagine that's quite easy to apply\u00a0\u00a0\noh that is creamy really cool i'm looking\u00a0\nforward to trying this yeah so the shades\u00a0\u00a0\nlike that so it is like a really nice deep\u00a0\nred oh yeah nice pigment to it as well\u00a0\u00a0\nand then lastly i picked up the british\u00a0\nmuseum again that's so hard to say\u00a0\u00a0\nit's probably not it's probably just me that finds\u00a0\nit difficult but this one is another egyptian one\u00a0\u00a0\nand this one is the fireworks palette look at\u00a0\nthis look at that oh that is just so pretty\nit's just stunning it's really stunning and the\u00a0\npackaging is such good quality we open it up and\u00a0\u00a0\nit's got frosted plastic over the mirror and\u00a0\nthen we even have like the the cover for the\u00a0\u00a0\nshadows has got the same design on it and this is\u00a0\nthe color story i mean these are just beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nlook at these two here lovely yeah so it's quite a\u00a0\nneutral palette but then there's a couple of pops\u00a0\u00a0\nof like yellow and blue in there as well i love\u00a0\nthis color that's really really nice i think i\u00a0\u00a0\nmight use that today actually so i'll give these\u00a0\na quick swatch for you i couldn't fit them all on\u00a0\u00a0\nat once but there's the fair slot these are\u00a0\nlovely really really nice the shimmers are\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful look that's the one i said i really\u00a0\nliked definitely going to be using that one\u00a0\u00a0\nand there's the last four so yeah really nice even\u00a0\nthis black came off really nice yeah they swatched\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautifully yeah so i have to say they they seem\u00a0\nreally nice from the swatches everything i swatch\u00a0\u00a0\nthe highlight of the lipstick and the palette all\u00a0\nseem really good quality so excited to try them\u00a0\u00a0\nout you have no idea how long i have wanted to\u00a0\ntry these out for so without further ado let's\u00a0\u00a0\nget stuck in right so i'm going to start off with\u00a0\neyes so obviously i'm going into that gorgeous\u00a0\u00a0\npalette i think i'm going to do kind of like a a\u00a0\nneutral look with the obviously the neutral shades\u00a0\u00a0\nand then i want to use that one on my inner part\u00a0\nof my eye just here i might do like a heart half\ni think what i'm gonna do is do like\nso i'm going to create like a a\u00a0\nhalf cut crease i think using that\u00a0\u00a0\nso right first of all what i'm\u00a0\ngoing to do is go into my crease\u00a0\u00a0\nand i think i'm going to go in with this shade\u00a0\nhere in the corner they don't have names so\u00a0\u00a0\ni'll just point did you ever stop and think\u00a0\nwhy spend too much time just getting ready\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me be honest i don't know a single thing\u00a0\nthat's gone on really really nicely actually\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm gonna blend that one out using the other\u00a0\none on this corner here can you see it's got\u00a0\u00a0\na little uh egyptian eye on it nice well i've\u00a0\nswatched it now so it's kind of gone but it did\nmy heart starts racing but i don't know if i\nthat's actually blended really really well\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah what i'm going to do though is i'm just going\u00a0\nto go back in i'll do that off camera because i'll\u00a0\u00a0\nbore you otherwise and then i'll just basically\u00a0\nrepeat that i'll just build it back up again\u00a0\u00a0\nright so i've done that these are so easy to\u00a0\nblend really really good quality eyeshadows right\u00a0\u00a0\nso then on this outer part here i think i'm gonna\u00a0\ntake this dark sort of reddish brown at the bottom\nright so that's that on let me hide this bit so\u00a0\nthat's that on and it when it's on it's not an\u00a0\u00a0\nawful lot dissimilar to this color that i've put\u00a0\nin the crease bearing in mind they look really\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent in the i don't they don't\u00a0\non camera but they do in person\u00a0\u00a0\nthey look this one is a lot darker than that\u00a0\none but it's blended out to quite a similar\u00a0\u00a0\nshade so what i think i'm going to do with that\u00a0\nin mind is i'm just going to dip in a tiny bit\u00a0\u00a0\ninto the black and go right here on my very\u00a0\nouter corner just to deepen it up a little bit\nyeah that's better so yeah like that so it just\u00a0\nlooks a little bit deeper in that corner but not\u00a0\u00a0\nlike overly right okay so the next thing i'm\u00a0\ngoing to do is just go away i'm just going\u00a0\u00a0\nto cut that in a part of my crease and\u00a0\nthen we'll go in with that blue shimmer\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so that's that done didn't\u00a0\nthat played up today to be honest\u00a0\u00a0\nit's taken me ages to do that right so i'm going\u00a0\ngonna go in with this shade just here it's kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof like a a teal blue really really pretty and\u00a0\ni'm gonna pop that where i have cut my crease\nthere's so much that i'm still keeping\u00a0\nto myself cause you don't listen babe\u00a0\u00a0\nbut still you got me missing\nthat is so pretty i absolutely love\u00a0\nthat it went on really nice as well\u00a0\u00a0\nobviously with the brush this is a brush right\u00a0\nthat i got from a next brush kit for christmas\u00a0\u00a0\nit is so good for packing on glitters and shimmers\u00a0\ni i thought it was i did a testing video recently\u00a0\u00a0\nand i wasn't sure if it was a brush or if it was\u00a0\nthe the palette but yeah i've used this loads\u00a0\u00a0\nof time since with loads of different shimmers\u00a0\nand it is so good i absolutely love this brush\nbut yeah so that's that on what i'm going to\u00a0\ndo is just blend that brownie shade back into\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit just to give it a bit more of like a\u00a0\ngradient effect okay so we are looking like that\u00a0\u00a0\nlove this absolutely love this right so underneath\u00a0\nwhat i'm going to do is take the i think i'm going\u00a0\u00a0\nto take the the darker brown shade so that\u00a0\nwas the one next to the black at the bottom\nokay so that's the eyeshadow done i think apart\u00a0\nfrom inner corners and brow bone i'll do that\u00a0\u00a0\nwith my highlighter in a moment um right\u00a0\nso i just pop some lashes and mascara on\u00a0\u00a0\nand then i'll be back so that's that done all\u00a0\ni did was pop some like little like cluster\u00a0\u00a0\ncorner lashes on the outer corners i've got\u00a0\na reappearance of my old mate mr watery eye\u00a0\u00a0\nhere so um just ignore this bit here where\u00a0\nit's worn off i'll sort that out at the end\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's no point in doing it now right so\u00a0\nhighlighter so as i say it's this one here\u00a0\u00a0\nvery very pretty i'm just hoping\u00a0\nit's not too dark so we'll try this\u00a0\u00a0\ni'll just take a small amount to start off with\u00a0\nso i don't know how pigmented it's going to be\nthat is stunning really really nice\nit's not um i mean i didn't take much maybe i'll\u00a0\ntake a little bit more it's not really in your\u00a0\u00a0\nface or anything like that it's it's a really nice\u00a0\nshimmer it's kind of like melts into your skin\nyeah look at that that is stunning i love that\ni can't get over that that is so pretty really\u00a0\nreally nice not too dark at all really nice\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i'm gonna pop some of that on my\u00a0\ninner corners and brow bone as well\nyeah love that highlighter really\u00a0\nreally nice right so we'll do lips next\u00a0\u00a0\nso obviously we're going in with this lipstick\u00a0\u00a0\ni might try it on its own because it's got a\u00a0\nnice sharp point on it so i might be all right\ni'm not that keen on the color the the formula is\u00a0\nreally nice went on really really well i love the\u00a0\u00a0\nshape of it because it makes it really really\u00a0\neasy to apply um but the color is not really\u00a0\u00a0\nme it is a nice red it's not as deep it's a\u00a0\nlot brighter than i thought it was going to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe but it's kind of like um i can't explain\u00a0\nit what kind of i thought it was going to be\u00a0\u00a0\na really deep bit like the one that i tried\u00a0\nin the revolution marilyn monroe video\u00a0\u00a0\ni thought it was going to be more like that uh\u00a0\nyeah maybe with a tan it'd be quite nice but\nyeah it's not really me right okay so what\u00a0\nelse we've got setting spray and that's the\u00a0\u00a0\nlast thing i think right so we'll try that next\u00a0\nso i'm gonna pop some of this on so we'll see\noh it's a very fine mist oh that's nice right\ni can't even feel that go on it is so fine\u00a0\ni know it's there because obviously it feels\u00a0\u00a0\nwet but i can't feel it going on at\u00a0\nall yeah that is a beautiful finish\u00a0\u00a0\nreally really nice they had one that\u00a0\ndidn't have the shimmer particles in it\u00a0\u00a0\num and there's this one you can't see them on\u00a0\nmy skin at all you can't see the shimmer but\u00a0\u00a0\nit does give like a really beautiful glow it\u00a0\nis very very similar to the iconic one actually\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah really nice i can't get over that highlighter\u00a0\ni keep looking at it what i'm going to do is\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm going to change my lip color because a i\u00a0\ndon't think it matches the eye look at all um\u00a0\u00a0\nand and b i'm not overly keen on the color so i'm\u00a0\ngonna do that sort my hair out and i'll be back\u00a0\u00a0\nokay and here is the finished look i'm obsessed\u00a0\ni love this stuff i really really do the palette\u00a0\u00a0\nthe spray the lipstick was really nice it was\u00a0\njust the color and the highlighter all amazing i\u00a0\u00a0\ni need more i really need more yeah there's\u00a0\nnothing more i can say i just loved all of it\u00a0\u00a0\nbrilliant quality beautiful pigment uh went on\u00a0\nreally easy these shadows blended beautifully\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah yeah i'm just i'm just in love with\u00a0\nit i i will get more and i will review\u00a0\u00a0\nmore probably on the next sale though unless\u00a0\nthe sales still on i'll have to have a look\u00a0\u00a0\nso here is a close-up of the eyes for\u00a0\nyou yeah i really really like them\u00a0\u00a0\nreally do i love that blue and um the darker\u00a0\nbrownie shade that i've used on the outer corner\u00a0\u00a0\njust here i think it blended back into that blue\u00a0\nreally really nicely yeah i love it so i hope you\u00a0\u00a0\nenjoyed watching and if you did please give me a\u00a0\nthumbs up and i'd really appreciate it i mean the\u00a0\u00a0\nabsolute world to me if you'd enjoy watching this\u00a0\nvideo and you would like to see more content from\u00a0\u00a0\nme in the future and you would like to subscribe\u00a0\nto

my hair because i\ndon't want it to get in the way\ni actually\ndon't wash my face in the morning unless\ni'm working out and then of course i\nwill wash my face afterwards but usually\ni just splash cold water on my face\nand pat it dry after the cold water\nwould be um\nvitamin c which i'm obsessed with ceo\nbrightening serum\nwhen i was growing up i had kind of\nmostly dry skin so i just kind of\nstarted\nlayering on i think when i was like 14 i\nwould use vaseline\nand just like put it everywhere i know\nthat sounds insane and then i learned\nlike a proper skincare routine after\nvitamin c i would usually probably\ndo a little eye cream again back with\nsunday riley i've been obsessed with\nthis brand ever since\ni first\nspent time in new york\nand my apartment was\nright next to\nsephora which is really dangerous for\nanyone but it's especially dangerous for\na brick because to a brit sephora is\nlike\nlike the most amazing place in the world\nmoisturizer\nthis is key to someone like me who has\nreally dry skin\nthe ice moisturizer\num so i'm just gonna put that everywhere\nas well\nand then apparently you're meant to\nbring it down to your neck which i\nalways forget to do but i'm gonna do it\ntoday for you guys\nrichardson was\nchallenging because\nyour skin is being put through so much\nyou're not getting enough sleep and\nthey're putting makeup on you every day\ni don't usually wear a lot of foundation\nso when you're\nbeing put in foundation every day and\npowder as well powder's something i\nnever usually\nwear in my day-to-day life but obviously\nfor\nso you don't look shiny on screen you're\nkind of caked in powder so\nnot necessarily a ton of obvious makeup\nbut definitely makeup that's gonna clog\nmy pores\nevery day it's very intense for your\nskin i and when you get a spot because\nyou're not able to really look after\nyourself the spot stays for like three\nweeks i had a one spot for three weeks\num which was a nightmare it was very big\nbut you know you just get on with it\nsunday ryan's junior oil i\nlove this product so much i mean\nespecially in winter again\ni put it on day and night and um you\nknow hope for the best\nwhen i have time\nand i'm not feeling super lazy which is\nmost days um i'll do a bit of which i\nlearnt from um\nprobably vogue\nbeauty secret videos when i have an\nearly morning\nwhen i remember i'll put this in the\nfridge the night before and i'll kind of\ndo this in the car on the way to work\nand i feel like it just de-puffs\ni think it was about\n13.\nand\nwhen i started wearing\nspf every day\nand i really do think it's a game\nchanger\ni love wearing wigs on any\njob because\nit kind of saves you the hassle of\nhaving to wash your hair at all\nand um\nand on bridgeton it was ideal because i\ndidn't really want to cut micro bangs\ninto my hair\ni think everyone was very happy when\nthey found out that it wasn't actually\nmy my real hair i don't tend to wear\nmakeup like every day in my normal life\ni'll usually just do a little bit of\nconcealer a brow i'm like\nobsessive about my brows but i'm gonna\ndo like a i don't know i'm going out for\na fancy lunch or something this is\nit's a special occasion i'm gonna start\nwith charlotte tilbury beautiful skin\nfoundation so instead of using a brush\ni'm gonna use my fingers\n[Music]\ni used to cake on makeup when i was a\nteenager\num\ncake it on and also we i i know they\nalways say 90s brows were skinny or the\nbad brows but\ni swear brows 10 years ago were pretty\nbad too or maybe that was just\nmy ear group because we all had like\nreally thin brows and we would pencil\nthem in i think my skin i think the main\nthing i learned about my skin was it\nactually looks better when i wear less\nmakeup because i was caking on so much\nthat it would\nclog\nmy nose that i'd be like flaking and you\njust learn so much i think as you get\nolder about skin and\nand makeup and what works for you the\none thing i have been using since i was\nprobably about 14 is the nars creamy\nconcealer and i actually do use a brush\nfor this\nso\ndon't worry guys\noh wait\ni'm gonna put it on with my fingers and\nthen i'll brush it\nin sixth form i would like\ncake on the whole you know\nthe whole works\nbut i feel like it\nmakeup\nto me then was more of an expression\nof how i felt and now\ni use clothes more i think to express\nmyself\nbut i think back then particularly\nwhen you're at school and you're you\nknow i went to a school as most people\ndo in england that you wear a uniform\nso the only way of expressing\noneself really is through\nmakeup um\nso that's what we do\ni always use charlotte tilbury's brow\ncheek it just glides on really easily so\ni'm just going to brush them up first\ni like to fill in\nunderneath\nbecause i like them to be straight\nwhen i look back at pictures they they\nwere like really long and thin\nand\ni don't know i just i like them chunky\nfat and chunky\nthis is the point where i say\nyour eyebrows are sisters not twins but\nyou've never heard that one before\nokay\nbarbara karanza brow soap\noh baby\nshe's hair\ni'm gonna do a little\nlittle eye contouring i'm just gonna go\nin with this color\ni'm gonna wet this and then i'll be back\nusually i lick it but today\ni'm not putting you through that so i\nput it under a tap\nso my technique\nfor an eye\nis basically just following\nthe end of my brow\nand pointing up towards it\nand sometimes it goes horribly wrong\ndepending on the day\ntoday\ntoday is going away so far next i'm\ngoing to curl my lashes\ncharlotte tilbury full fat lashes\ni think the interesting thing about\nfilming that show is that\nwhen you're in it when you're filming it\nall you're thinking about is\nhow am i gonna\nhow am i gonna stay\nhealthy and\nmentally and physically well enough to\ndo this job\nuh and it's\nyou're not really thinking about what\nit's gonna be or\nhow people are gonna\nsee the show or if they're gonna connect\nto it it's just literally all about like\ngetting through it\nand then covered happened and\nthe show came out\nat a time where everyone was at home and\nso i think in some ways that was a good\nthing but there were\nit was strange being at home with\nplatforms like instagram\nand tick tock and that being the only\nkind of\nresource to see how well the show was\ndoing and suddenly you're kind of it's\nquite overwhelming\nexperiencing it\nat home\nfrom a phone because it doesn't feel it\ndoesn't really feel real it was weird\nstepping out into the real world and\nrealizing that\nthe success of the show in general and\nhow it like touched people and\ni really love it when girls come over\nand in the street young girls and we're\nso affected by it so and it brought\npeople a lot of joy in like that strange\ntimes now i use a little bit of bronzer\ni have the contour one by charlotte\ntilbury and\nit's just so easy to use i'm also\nkind of obsessed with\nanything liquid form i think because i\nhave dry skin\ni just like the sheen that it gives\nand i'm done\njust kidding then we're gonna blend\ncharlotte tilbury\npillow talk lip and cheek glow\nagain it's um\nit's a liquid form which i like because\ni can use my fingers\nthis is my go-to charlotte tubby lip\nlipchi i actually use this in bridgeton\na lot\nlip balm this is the we do\nprotect balm i love this product all our\nproducts are\nsustainable and vegan and\nnatural and\nthey're doing good things for the world\nso\nand if i'm feeling really fruity\nwhich i am we\ndo a little bit of this\nfill in my beauty mark it's funny how\nthe things that you hate when you're\nyounger\nyou\nstart to\nrealize make you\nyou know unique and individual so\nfinishing touch\na little pop\nhollywood beauty light one\nand i use the same\nbrush that i use to do my\nconcealer\nbecause then when i do my concealer the\nnext day get a little bit of\nshine that's still on the brush\nand then\ni would probably let my hair down\nthe amazing thing about we do is that\nall their products double up as things\nso this is\na hair and hand cream which i think is\njust genius\nso i can basically\ndo two things\nat once which if you want in there no\nin a rush\nis the dream put some hand cream on and\nthen put some through the ends\n[Music]\nmason and pierce some hair brush every\ntime i use this it really reminds me of\nmy grandma it was the one thing i always\nused to\nwatch her sort of\nbrushing her hair with mason peasant and\nshe'd get me one\noh she get me one for christmas every\nyear in my teens and i'd lose it all the\ntime\nbecause i was an idiot teenager and and\nnow i treasure them i'm going to finish\nit by spraying some stellar times by\ndoing neutrons i'm obsessed with this\nfragrance\njust put it\neverywhere thank you so much for\nwatching i hope you enjoyed this video\nand um i really enjoyed doing it so um\nthanks folk\nhave a

        "transcript_text": "hey guys it's victoria welcome back to\nmy channel in today's video i'm going to\nbe trying out a new palette from nyx\nthis is the nyx ultimate queen eyeshadow\npalette i picked up the jumbo one so\nit's a very large palette has all these\ngorgeous neutral colors in here\nso i'm very excited to try this one out\ni think i want to do more of a smokier\neye look today but we'll kind of just\nfigure it out as we go along so let's\nget started\n[Music]\nso the shades in here look so gorgeous\nthere are a bunch of matte shades and\na bunch of shimmery colors there's\ngold's neutrals you have some more mauvy\nkind of tones here and this is a really\ngood combination of colors i think i\nhaven't really done a drugstore palette\nin a while\nso i wanted to try this one out\nso i already primed my lids with some\nconcealer\nso i'm just going to start out by going\nin with a fluffy morphe brush and\nthere's no name so i'm just going to\npoint to which color i'm using i'm going\nto start out with this neutral matte\nshade i'm just going to dust this color\nall over the lid\nusing the same brush i'm going to go\ninto this matte brown shade\nand i'm going to focus this shade more\ntowards the outer corners of my eyes and\nalso drag it into my crease just a\nlittle bit to add some more definition\nto the eyes\nso i think that the look that i want to\ngo for today i'm gonna smoke my lash\nline out a little bit more like towards\nmy upper lash line and wing it out so to\ndo this you could either use\na piece of tape and just tape that along\nthe outer corner of your eye or you\ncould use like a stiffer piece of paper\nlike a card and\nrub your eye shadow along that side but\nmy favorite way to do it is just to use\na small angled eyeliner brush kind of\njust like this one and go into a dark\neyeshadow shade and define that line\njust by drawing it there so i'm going to\ngo into this matte black shade\non my brush and i'm just going to follow\nthat lower lash line\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nso now i am going to go into this dark\nbrown shade right here on a small morphe\nblending brush this is a morphe m506 and\ni am just going to blend that shade\nright along my lash line\nand along that\nblack shade that we just applied\n[Music]\nand then i'm going back in with the\nblack eyeshadow and just\nreplacing that\ni'm also pulling it in towards the\ncrease a little bit\nand then i'm going back in with brown\neyeshadow just to\nbring some of that shade back out\nbecause it kind of got a little bit\nwashed out by all the black and now i am\njust going to pop on some lashes so the\nones that i'm using today are from kiss\n[Music]\n[Music]\ni do want this look to be a little bit\nmore smoky i am going to add some black\npencil liner to my waterline as well as\nto my tightline and then i'm adding some\nmascara to my top and bottom lashes\n[Music]\ni forgot to add some eyeshadow to my\nlower lash line so i'm just going to go\ninto this dark brown shade and place\nthat right along my lower lash line\n[Music]\nand i'm going to place a little bit of\nthat black eyeshadow\non the outer half of my lower lash line\ngoing in again with the black eyeshadow\non my angled eyeliner brush\ni'm just adding some inner corner liner\nyou could also use a liquid eyeliner to\ndo this as well\nand to add a little bit of highlight to\nthe eyes although you could leave it\njust\nstraight matte that would look really\ngood too but i am going to go in with a\nmorphe pencil brush and on my brow bone\ni'm going to use this highlighting shade\nand just place that\nand right above my inner corner here i\nwant to add a little bit of shimmer as\nwell so i'm going to go into this\nshimmery color\nor maybe i'll use this one or i should\nuse this one\nuh it's kind of too much of a yellowy\ngold than what i'm trying to go for\ntoday see this shade this gold shade\nthat's a really pretty gold too well\ni'll use this one wait\na sheet i'm gonna use that shade because\nthat'll go better with the smoky eye\nlook so i'm going to into this shimmery\ncolor\nand i'm just going to pop this right\nonto the inner corner\njust because it helps kind of just add a\nlittle bit something extra to the eye\n[Music]\nand now that the eyes are done we can\nmove on to finishing up the face makeup\nso i am starting out by using some\nbenefit cosmetics hula bronzer and\nbronzing my face up\n[Music]\nand using my kylie cosmetics translucent\npowder i am going in to clean up this\ncontour and bake my face\n[Music]\nand i'm adding a little bit of\nhighlighter to my nose i've added blush\nbefore i did\nmy highlighter but i forgot so i'm just\nadding\nsome nyx blush it's in the shade pinched\nand now i'm adding my highlighter\nplacing it also onto my cheekbones\nmy cupid's bow\nand i went ahead and applied a nyx nude\nlip pencil and over top of that i'm\ngoing in with my nyx butter gloss in the\nshade creme brulee i am going to just\nplace this right over top and this is\nthe finished look\nso i love this look i think that it\nwould even be really good for\nvalentine's day because like a nice\nsmokey eye so you could keep it as a\nnude lip or add a red lip i think this\nwould be perfect for that but overall\nthis palette i think that it's a really\ngood palette there are a bunch of shades\nin here all these shades blended\nbeautifully and i know i didn't try out\nthe shimmers too much but when i\nswatched them they were so pigmented and\ni just think this is a really great\naffordable palette if you are looking\nfor something that you can use every day\nwith a bunch of neutrals this is\ndefinitely the palette for that so i\nhope you guys liked today's video if you\ndid be sure to give it a thumbs up and\nsubscribe if you are new hit the bell\nbutton to turn on your post\nnotifications so you're notified when i\nupload a new video and i will see you\nguys next time thanks for watching bye\n[Music]\nyou",

        "transcript_text": "hi i'm michelle of Lab Muffin Beauty\u00a0\nScience chemistry phd and cosmetic chemist\u00a0\u00a0\ntoday i'm going to be reviewing a bunch of korean\u00a0\nskincare products i've recently tried from brands\u00a0\u00a0\ni haven't really reviewed much before and there's\u00a0\nactually some really interesting biology involved\nthis video is sponsored by stylekorean\u00a0\nan online store that stocks a lot of\u00a0\u00a0\nkorean products which i'm sure\u00a0\nno one expected from the name\u00a0\u00a0\nlike and subscribe and click the nerdification\u00a0\nbell so you know when new videos go up\nthe first brand i'm talking about is lagom\u00a0\nlagom means not too little not too much just\u00a0\u00a0\nthe right amount in swedish and that's pretty\u00a0\nmuch what this skincare brand's approach is\u00a0\u00a0\ntheir products try to give skin what it needs\u00a0\nin the right amount and removing what it doesn't\u00a0\u00a0\nneed but not removing too much the main thing\u00a0\nthat made me really interested in lagom is\u00a0\u00a0\nthat the people behind the brand includes\u00a0\na team of 12 scientists and dermatologists\u00a0\u00a0\nas well as one of korea's top makeup artists\u00a0\nwhich is a combination you don't often see\u00a0\u00a0\ni think it's really cool to get this\u00a0\nbroad range of input from a lot of\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent experts i think you end up with\u00a0\na much more well-rounded product that way\ni really love their branding and packaging as\u00a0\nwell their scale logo is really cute maybe i\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it because it's pretty similar to my website\u00a0\nbranding i've tried a couple of lagom products\u00a0\u00a0\nbefore i've reviewed them on my blog and i really\u00a0\nlike the formulations but they just didn't really\u00a0\u00a0\nfit into my routine the cellup gel to water\u00a0\ncleanser is a really gentle morning cleanser but\u00a0\u00a0\ni don't really need a morning cleanser their\u00a0\nsunscreen has a really nice formulation but\u00a0\u00a0\nthe uva protection was a bit too low\u00a0\nfor me it's got pa with three pluses\u00a0\u00a0\nand i just really need uva protection so i\u00a0\nwas pretty excited to try these formulations\u00a0\u00a0\nand i wasn't disappointed the first one i'm going\u00a0\nto talk about is the cellus deep moisture cream\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is one of the nicest moisturisers i've\u00a0\never used i'm not sure if i can say favorite\u00a0\u00a0\nyet but it is definitely up there it's really\u00a0\nlightweight and hydrating you don't need to use\u00a0\u00a0\na lot it absorbs really nicely it has a silky\u00a0\ntexture it works really well under makeup which\u00a0\u00a0\ni guess is not surprising given that a makeup\u00a0\nartist had input i'm actually wearing it now\u00a0\u00a0\ni mixed it in with my foundation it also works\u00a0\nreally well to hydrate your skin overnight and\u00a0\u00a0\nit's one of those moisturisers where your skin\u00a0\nis still hydrated in the morning and surprisingly\u00a0\u00a0\nit was still hydrated after washing with cleanser\u00a0\ni have pretty dehydration-prone skin so finding\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething that gives me that dewyness without\u00a0\nbeing too much or too heavy because i'm also oily\u00a0\u00a0\nis amazing this cream gets my skin to that perfect\u00a0\namount of dewyness where it's not gross and shiny\u00a0\u00a0\nbut it's just really hydrated getting your skin\u00a0\nwell hydrated is a really good way of hiding pores\u00a0\u00a0\nand texture if you plump up your skin then pores\u00a0\nand fine lines look a lot less obvious that's what\u00a0\u00a0\nyou really want if you're going for glowy skin\u00a0\nyou want smoother texture and hydration is one\u00a0\u00a0\nof those things that seems temporary but makes\u00a0\na massive difference if your skin is dehydration\u00a0\u00a0\nprone and you want something that really packs\u00a0\na punch without being too heavy or greasy\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is so good it is fragranced but it's not\u00a0\ntoo strong and the smell goes away really quickly\u00a0\u00a0\nit smells a bit like lemon lollies it has been\u00a0\nclinically tested to be really non-irritating so\u00a0\u00a0\nit should be fine for sensitive skin\u00a0\nunless you're really unlucky in terms\u00a0\u00a0\nof ingredients it's got lots of humectants and\u00a0\nlight emollients and an active called Aqualicia\nAqualicia is listed as hydrolysed vegetable\u00a0\nprotein in the ingredients list it's actually\u00a0\u00a0\nan acacia seed extract mixed with maltodextrin\u00a0\nand this works on aquaporins you might have heard\u00a0\u00a0\nskincare companies talking about nobel prize\u00a0\nwinning science and basically what this is is\u00a0\u00a0\nthe nobel prize in chemistry in 2003 was given to\u00a0\ntwo scientists that worked on discovering channels\u00a0\u00a0\nin cell membranes the cell membrane is like the\u00a0\noutside of a cell the barrier it's sort of like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe skin of a cell if we zoom in it looks like\u00a0\nthis so for a substance to get into a cell it can\u00a0\u00a0\neither diffuse through the cell membrane which\u00a0\nis quite tricky some molecules can do it some\u00a0\u00a0\nmolecules can't and you can't really do much to\u00a0\nhelp that the other option is if it fits into one\u00a0\u00a0\nof these special channels it has a much easier\u00a0\ntime going in it's sort of like a vip entrance\u00a0\u00a0\nthere are tons of different channels and one\u00a0\ntype is for water and these are called aquaporins\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause they're sort of like a special pore for\u00a0\nwater now the top layer of your skin the stratum\u00a0\u00a0\ncorneum or what we usually call the barrier this\u00a0\nacts a lot like a cell membrane much like a cell\u00a0\u00a0\nmembrane there are aquaporin channels in it and it\u00a0\nturns out a lot of ingredients that interact with\u00a0\u00a0\nthese aquaporins are really effective at hydrating\u00a0\ndeep in your skin for example one of my favorite\u00a0\u00a0\ningredients glycerin my precious is one of the\u00a0\nfew molecules that some of these channels let\u00a0\u00a0\nthrough along with water and it's probably one of\u00a0\nthe reasons why glycerin is just so darn good at\u00a0\u00a0\na hydrating skin it also turns out that tons of\u00a0\ningredients that we already use in our skincare\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts seem to do stuff with aquaporins and some\u00a0\nof them aren't really well known for moisturising\u00a0\u00a0\nso for example caffeine and retinoids are really\u00a0\ngood at acting on aquaporins and we all know that\u00a0\u00a0\nretinoids do not hydrate your skin so i don't\u00a0\nthink it's really worth specifically seeking out\u00a0\u00a0\naquaporin products if you want to help hydrate\u00a0\nyour skin it doesn't really tell you more about\u00a0\u00a0\nwhether the product will hydrate your skin than\u00a0\nreading reviews or trying it out on your skin\nthis ingredient has been specifically tested\u00a0\nfor hydration and it works really well\u00a0\u00a0\nit is also a humectant so it could also\u00a0\nbe that long story short whether it's\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Aqualicia or the rest of the\u00a0\ningredients that's doing the work\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is an absolutely gorgeous moisturiser\u00a0\nthat hydrates my skin so much better than\u00a0\u00a0\na lot of other products i've tried so i\u00a0\nthink it's probably the combination of both\nthe next lagom product i tried\u00a0\nwas the cellus aqualene solution\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is an anti-aging and hydrating essence it's\u00a0\na newer launch from lagom it's only been out for\u00a0\u00a0\nless than six months and it is very hydrating\u00a0\ni would say it is kind of violently hydrating\u00a0\u00a0\nit has a really unusual texture that i quite like\u00a0\nit's very thin and it feels like an oil it spreads\u00a0\u00a0\nreally easily and after it's been absorbed\u00a0\nit's not oily it's probably the product with\u00a0\u00a0\nthe most dewiness packed into each drop i've ever\u00a0\ntried on my whole face i needed like four drops\u00a0\u00a0\nand i think it's actually a really good value\u00a0\nhydrating product because you need so little to\u00a0\u00a0\nspread on your face this has a lemon fragrance it\u00a0\nis a bit stronger than the cream but it doesn't\u00a0\u00a0\nbecome too noticeable if you mix it into another\u00a0\nproduct and you don't really need a lot of it\u00a0\u00a0\nas well as Aqualicia it's also got aquatide\u00a0\nwhich is a really interesting anti-aging peptide\u00a0\u00a0\nit works on texture it moisturises skin it's also\u00a0\nantioxidant it's gotten tons of awards and hype i\u00a0\u00a0\nreally like this it is excellent and hydrating but\u00a0\ni guess i'm not quite as impressed by this as i\u00a0\u00a0\nam with the cream because there are quite a lot of\u00a0\nhydrating serums out there although the texture of\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is really lovely and quite unique and i think\u00a0\ni'll be using this a lot more going into winter\nthe next i tried is atopalm and i was\u00a0\nreally excited to try these because atopalm\u00a0\u00a0\nand their parent company neopharm they're really\u00a0\nfamous for doing a bunch of peer-reviewed studies\u00a0\u00a0\non skin care they're particularly well known\u00a0\nfor studies on moisturisers and the impact\u00a0\u00a0\nof moisturising on your skin and on your body\u00a0\nin general if you read articles and textbooks\u00a0\u00a0\nabout the signs of moisturisers you'll just\u00a0\nkeep coming across atopalm and neopharm\nthese products are MLE products and what that\u00a0\nstands for is multi-lamellar emulsion technology\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat it means is that these products use the\u00a0\nright mix of three types of lipids which are\u00a0\u00a0\noily ingredients specifically it's cholesterol\u00a0\nfree fatty acids and ceramides and they actually\u00a0\u00a0\nuse patented versions that they make from plant\u00a0\ningredients this mix is special because it means\u00a0\u00a0\nthat the final product has a really similar\u00a0\nstructural arrangement to the lipids that are\u00a0\u00a0\nnaturally in your skin barrier so the idea is\u00a0\nthese products are really good at meshing with\u00a0\u00a0\nand adding to your skin's lipids so it's adding\u00a0\na barrier to your skin while being as similar to\u00a0\u00a0\nyour skin as possible there's evidence that this\u00a0\nis better at hydrating skin and it makes a really\u00a0\u00a0\ngood base for delivering active ingredients\u00a0\nthe research on MLE has been around for almost\u00a0\u00a0\n20 years so it's actually quite surreal to be\u00a0\nholding and using the products that i keep on\u00a0\u00a0\nreading about so yeah i guess it's pretty obvious\u00a0\nthat i'm probably pretty biased here because i'm\u00a0\u00a0\nreviewing these products after seeing scientists\u00a0\nhype them up ever since i started getting into\u00a0\u00a0\nthe science of skin care i guess to no one's\u00a0\nsurprise atopalm has a really good reputation as\u00a0\u00a0\na dermocosmetic in korea these are those products\u00a0\nthat dermatologists recommend for sensitive skin\nfun fact some of the researchers that did the\u00a0\nMLE research including the founder of atopalm\u00a0\u00a0\nwere involved in developing aquatide which\u00a0\nwas the active ingredient in the lagom product\u00a0\u00a0\nfirst up we have the mle cream this was the\u00a0\nfirst korean skincare product to be officially\u00a0\u00a0\nrecognised by the ministry of food and drug safety\u00a0\nas a functional cosmetic helpful in restoring\u00a0\u00a0\nthe skin barrier function it has the mle in it\u00a0\nwhich is the special mix of ceramides and lipids\u00a0\u00a0\nit's also got a whole bunch of other moisturising\u00a0\ningredients like shea butter hyaluronic acid amino\u00a0\u00a0\nacids and allentown this is a really thick cream\u00a0\nwith a mild eucalyptus scent it feels sort of like\u00a0\u00a0\nyou're getting a really light whiff of a medicated\u00a0\nointment it's targeted for dry and sensitive skin\u00a0\u00a0\nso it's thicker and more emollient than a lot of\u00a0\nthe other products i've been trying but it still\u00a0\u00a0\ndoesn't feel greasy i have oily skin and it's\u00a0\ncoming to the middle of summer here in australia\u00a0\u00a0\nso i haven't really been able to test this\u00a0\nproperly on my face but i did have a flaky elbow\u00a0\u00a0\nfor a week that i just kept on ignoring because\u00a0\nthat's just who i am eventually i remembered i\u00a0\u00a0\nhad a whole bunch of skincare and i should do\u00a0\nsomething about it so i put this on it and it\u00a0\u00a0\npretty much just stopped being flaky overnight\u00a0\nwhich i thought was incredibly impressive the mle\u00a0\u00a0\nlotion is pretty much the same sort of product but\u00a0\nit's in a much more lightweight texture i've been\u00a0\u00a0\nreally impressed by the cream so far i'm going\u00a0\nto have to test it out properly in winter and\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm going to have to try the MLE lotion on my face\u00a0\nin winter but so far everything looks really good\nthe final brand i tried is from neogen\u00a0\ndermalogy it feels like i'm missing a\u00a0\u00a0\nsyllable there dermaled dermology dermalogy neogen\u00a0\nis a brand i've seen around but i haven't really\u00a0\u00a0\ntried them and there isn't that much info\u00a0\nabout the brand online so i don't really have\u00a0\u00a0\na good idea of what the brand story is they have\u00a0\nsome mysterious six core technologies thing and\u00a0\u00a0\nthey might have some clean beauty in there\u00a0\nwhich i think they've rebranded as conscious\nthe two products i tried are snail products from\u00a0\ntheir cica repair snail range snail mucus is a\u00a0\u00a0\nclassic korean skincare ingredient and at least\u00a0\ntwo og asian skincare bloggers named their blogs\u00a0\u00a0\nafter this ingredient 50 shades of snail and holy\u00a0\nsnails it's one of the few gimmicky exotic asian\u00a0\u00a0\nskincare ingredients that stuck around unlike\u00a0\nthings like starfish extract and horse oil which\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm pretty sure no one cares about anymore i think\u00a0\nthat's decent evidence for snail extract working\u00a0\u00a0\nfor a lot of people it's good for a bunch of\u00a0\nthings brightening hydration and smoothing\u00a0\u00a0\nobviously snail mucus is not vegan but the snails\u00a0\ndon't get killed in the process of harvesting\u00a0\u00a0\nnewer processes claim that snails aren't harmed on\u00a0\nthe website in the product descriptions for these\u00a0\u00a0\ntwo products neogen actually says using snail\u00a0\nmucus extracted in a natural way not in an abusive\u00a0\u00a0\nor harsh way in an environment where snails can\u00a0\nlive without stress from the outside environment\u00a0\u00a0\nso they really make a sound like the snails are\u00a0\nin a day spa i'm sure it's not quite that nice but\u00a0\u00a0\ni think it is a lot gentler than it used to be\nso both products have a lot of snail mucus in\u00a0\nthem they also have centella extract which you can\u00a0\u00a0\nprobably tell from the cica repair name the cream\u00a0\nalso has two percent niacinamide both of these\u00a0\u00a0\nhave really gooey textures which is pretty typical\u00a0\nfor snail products they're really hydrating and\u00a0\u00a0\nlightweight and a little goes a long way with\u00a0\nthese the gooey snail texture was actually a deal\u00a0\u00a0\nbreaker for me with the snail cream i found it\u00a0\nreally hard to get a small amount out of the jar\u00a0\u00a0\nit's also a bit liquidy so with my pathological\u00a0\nlack of coordination it feels like it's always\u00a0\u00a0\nabout to spill out of the jar i also just really\u00a0\ndidn't like the scent of this product it has\u00a0\u00a0\nthis berry-ish cherry smell which i just have a\u00a0\nparticular aversion to it's also stronger than\u00a0\u00a0\ni like and so i couldn't really ignore it this\u00a0\ndoes seem to be reasonably good for sensitive skin\u00a0\u00a0\nthough i've seen reviews saying that they usually\u00a0\nbreak out with snail products but not with this\u00a0\u00a0\nthe snail essence is a lot more\u00a0\nmanageable since it comes with a pump\u00a0\u00a0\nbut it does have that same scent i do really\u00a0\nlike the packaging though it's pretty cute and\u00a0\u00a0\nfun but i think i'm just not really the target\u00a0\naudience for this i think maybe i'm just too old\u00a0\u00a0\ni think these products will work really\u00a0\nwell for someone who wants to try some\u00a0\u00a0\nsnail products that target uneven skin tone\u00a0\nthat are also really good at hydrating skin\nso i hope this was an interesting review let me\u00a0\nknow if you've tried any of these products before\u00a0\u00a0\nand what you thought like and subscribe if you\u00a0\nlike science based beauty content follow me on\u00a0\u00a0\ninstagram and tiktok and check out my blog as well\u00a0\nand i'll see you next time for more beauty science",

        "transcript_text": "hi loves this elle welcome back to my\u00a0\nchannel and thank you so much for being here\u00a0\u00a0\nexcuse the head wrap i just got out of the shower\u00a0\nbecause we're talking about skin care today\u00a0\u00a0\nlet's start off the new year we're talking about\u00a0\na brand new skincare line that i've actually been\u00a0\u00a0\nusing for i think about two months now a little\u00a0\nless than two months all right so before we get\u00a0\u00a0\nstarted hit the subscribe button share this video\u00a0\nsomebody think might like it and let's do it\nso today we're gonna be talking all about a brand\u00a0\nthat you guys have asked me so much about and it\u00a0\u00a0\nis dime beauty okay now dime beauty basically has\u00a0\nthe most amazing packaging i mean this packaging\u00a0\u00a0\nis beautiful but when you guys asked me i had\u00a0\nactually never heard of it i just have their\u00a0\u00a0\nwebsite pulled up here right now um and i wasn't\u00a0\nquite sure about it now they do have a few makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nitems as well and they have some wellness and that\u00a0\ntype of thing now what i love about this is that\u00a0\u00a0\nthey started it was like this husband and wife\u00a0\ncouple and then because she saw a need to provide\u00a0\u00a0\nclean um optimized skin care for women of all ages\u00a0\nwhich i love and she says that as a skincare and\u00a0\u00a0\nbeauty advocate herself she wanted to learn more\u00a0\nabout skin care space and wanted to understand how\u00a0\u00a0\nshe could take her skin health to the next level\u00a0\nokay so she basically decided to create this line\u00a0\u00a0\nand she decided to become a master esthetician\u00a0\nwhich i absolutely love and then um during her\u00a0\u00a0\ntime she basically just did a bunch of studying\u00a0\nand she wanted something that really spoke to\u00a0\u00a0\npeople of all ages um and that's kind of where it\u00a0\ncame from but it definitely is in the vein of like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe green beauty space okay so what i decided to\u00a0\ndo was because i felt there were like quite a bit\u00a0\u00a0\nof options and i only did skin care um if you want\u00a0\nme to try some other stuff then let me know but\u00a0\u00a0\ni only did um skincare okay so they do have sets\u00a0\nnow i'm trying to find which set i did okay so i\u00a0\u00a0\ndid something called the works it's 146 right now\u00a0\nbecause they're having a sale it's normally 172\u00a0\u00a0\num and you can also subscribe and save money and\u00a0\nthey can send it to you and blah blah blah blah\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so what this is it says get your dream\u00a0\nskin minus the hassle um our all-in-one base\u00a0\u00a0\nbundle will keep your routine simple while\u00a0\nstill giving you the results that you've\u00a0\u00a0\never dreamed of blah blah blah blah blah okay\u00a0\nso they also put on here the ewg which is a\u00a0\u00a0\nthird party system that is unregulated so\u00a0\nkeep that in mind but they basically put up\u00a0\u00a0\na different ingredients you can go to the website\u00a0\nand then they kind of link these ingredients and\u00a0\u00a0\ntell you how safe they are basically for the\u00a0\nbody and the skin okay so let's start with the\u00a0\u00a0\ncleanser i'm going to show you how all of these\u00a0\ngo on the skin but the cleanser i obviously\u00a0\u00a0\nalready used i'm going to tell you something\u00a0\nabout this this cleanser for me has the worst\u00a0\u00a0\nsmell it literally turns my stomach a little bit\u00a0\nso um i'm i'm i think it's the coconut extract\u00a0\u00a0\nwith i don't even know what else let's see um\u00a0\nit's called their gentle jelly cleanser and it has\u00a0\u00a0\nnothing no ingredients that are are making me\u00a0\nnervous really none of these products do so i\u00a0\u00a0\nlove that um but there is some weird scents going\u00a0\non here so i can't use this so unfortunately this\u00a0\u00a0\nwill be given to somebody that doesn't mind\u00a0\nthe smell around me because i would hate to\u00a0\u00a0\nthis does not need to be thrown away um but it's\u00a0\na gel cleanser so this is not meant for dehydrated\u00a0\u00a0\nor dry skin although it is gentle i find it not\u00a0\nhydrating enough for my skin all right so the next\u00a0\u00a0\none we're going to go into is the super skin toner\u00a0\ni really love the ingredients minus their witch\u00a0\u00a0\nhazel um it's not it's i mean it's high enough on\u00a0\nthis on the ingredient list that if you have an\u00a0\u00a0\nissue with witch hazel this is probably not going\u00a0\nto be for you but i don't notice any sensitivity\u00a0\u00a0\nany weirdness from witch hazel in this so i don't\u00a0\nmind it but i love it has hyaluronic acid it has\u00a0\u00a0\ncoq10 in it um it has aloe leaf in it also aloe\u00a0\nvera um so and and chamomile which is also very\u00a0\u00a0\nvery calming cucumber glycerin um just some really\u00a0\ngreat ingredients so what i would consider this\u00a0\u00a0\nso for me i do just do this use it as a toner i\u00a0\ndon't put it on any kind of pad or anything that\u00a0\u00a0\ni just pat it into the skin now if you are\u00a0\nmore normal dry sorry more normal combination\u00a0\u00a0\noily you could actually use this as an essence\u00a0\nbecause it doesn't treat anything there's no acids\u00a0\u00a0\nin it there's no nothing like that it's literally\u00a0\njust a hydrating toner but for me since we're also\u00a0\u00a0\nin the middle of winter for me it's just not\u00a0\nhydrating enough so i will put this on first\u00a0\u00a0\nand then i would pop another essence on over this\u00a0\ni will give you a general note about all these\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts they sink into the skin so so quickly\u00a0\ni don't know how she does it but no matter how\u00a0\u00a0\nmany layers of stuff that i put on it sinks into\u00a0\nthe skin like an absolute dream so i do love that\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so while the skin is still damp from my toner\u00a0\nand my essence i got the hyper glow which is their\u00a0\u00a0\nantioxidant vitamin c serum this is actually my\u00a0\nfavorite thing from the line it is super super\u00a0\u00a0\nlightweight it has held up it has not oxidized\u00a0\nhardly at all since i've had it and it is super\u00a0\u00a0\nsuper lightweight like i just can't tell\u00a0\nyou enough about how lightweight it is\u00a0\u00a0\nit has no smell to it it doesn't feel stinging\u00a0\nnothing like that um it has uh obviously vitamin\u00a0\u00a0\nc in it and it is ascorbic acid so it is a\u00a0\nlot more stable than most so this is becoming\u00a0\u00a0\nfast my fast friends my favorite vitamin c if\u00a0\nyou want something that's gentle that most people\u00a0\u00a0\ncould use that is a great vitamin c it also again\u00a0\nhas aloe in it vitamin e ferulic acid of course um\u00a0\u00a0\nsodium hyaluronate which is hyaluronic acid it\u00a0\nalso has resveratrol in it which i absolutely love\u00a0\u00a0\nit's another type of antioxidant that's going to\u00a0\nbe supportive to vitamin c it's a beautiful very\u00a0\u00a0\nwell studied antioxidant and very potent vitamins\u00a0\nantioxidant it also has a bunch of other great\u00a0\u00a0\nthings in here as far as hydrators and overall\u00a0\ngreat things for the skin these all are water\u00a0\u00a0\nbased so just keep that in mind as well and then\u00a0\num what i've been going into is the hyaluronic\u00a0\u00a0\nacid serum and i will just do and it's just\u00a0\ntwo two to three drops of these things now this\u00a0\u00a0\nhyaluronic acid serum is thinner than most and\u00a0\nagain it goes in through skin very very quickly\nfeels so good and these products none of these\u00a0\nones that we've used so far have any weird smell\u00a0\u00a0\nto them they have really nothing to them i just\u00a0\ndon't know why that cleanser smells so odd and\u00a0\u00a0\nthere is no fragrance in the ingredients list\u00a0\num the ingredients in the hyaluronic acid are\u00a0\u00a0\nvery minimal which i do love um it's literally\u00a0\njust green tea hyaluronic acid and a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nof coconut extract which is not going to be\u00a0\nsensitizing to you guys if you have a coconut\u00a0\u00a0\num issue with coconut okay obviously if you have\u00a0\na anaphylactic allergy to coconut this these would\u00a0\u00a0\nnot be for you okay all right then let's kind of\u00a0\nfinish this up around it out with their eye cream\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is their luminous eye serum and\u00a0\nit's very kind of like jelly like\u00a0\u00a0\nokay a little bit goes a very long way and it\u00a0\nis very soothing and smoothing to the eye area\nconcealer goes beautiful over it it's very very\u00a0\nlightweight again i don't think that the eye cream\u00a0\u00a0\nis in let's see here yeah the eye cream is not in\u00a0\nthe works i must have gotten that separate yeah i\u00a0\u00a0\nmust have gotten that separate okay they also have\u00a0\na few other eye creams i honestly just got what i\u00a0\u00a0\nfelt was best for me at that time um this product\u00a0\nis gives a little luminosity to under the eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich i don't know if i necessarily agree with um\u00a0\ni just feel like it just looks hydrated um it is\u00a0\u00a0\nvegan cruelty free of course lessons puffiness\u00a0\nimproves dark circles uh youthful appearance to\u00a0\u00a0\nthe eye so this is basically a general eye cream\u00a0\nokay it's just a general eye cream but great for\u00a0\u00a0\noverall anti-aging it's just it's not going to\u00a0\nlike be this miraculous thing to lift and firm\u00a0\u00a0\nthis eye area that kind of thing i just liked it\u00a0\nbecause it was a good everyday eye cream okay now\u00a0\u00a0\nlet's talk about their day cream which is their\u00a0\ndo day cream it has rose hip in it which is a very\u00a0\u00a0\ngentle alternative and a very lower in percentage\u00a0\nof vitamin a so it's not it's not heavy definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nnot heavy but it's also not like super lightweight\u00a0\nso if you are more oily to dry i'm sorry oily\u00a0\u00a0\nto normal you just want to use this sparingly\u00a0\nbut again it sinks into the skin so quickly i\u00a0\u00a0\ncan actually use my josie moran or my kinship spf\u00a0\nover this and i have absolutely no problem with it\u00a0\u00a0\num it takes five seconds for it to sink in okay\u00a0\nand the ingredients in here literally are just\u00a0\u00a0\na bunch of hydrators that's all it is there's\u00a0\nnothing in here i mean it's like squalene and um\u00a0\u00a0\nlinolenic acid it also has ceramides in it um it's\u00a0\njust basically a really beautiful day hydrating\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know moisturizer it's very basic but it\u00a0\nis very pretty i i don't want to discount it\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause it is a ceramide rich night uh day\u00a0\ncream so if that's what you're looking for\u00a0\u00a0\nthis might be something to look into okay my last\u00a0\none that i got is their restorative night cream\u00a0\u00a0\nand it looks very similar to their day cream\u00a0\nokay but i want to tell you a little bit about it\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so it's very similar to the day cream with\u00a0\nall the things i already had talking about talked\u00a0\u00a0\nabout but it also has sea buckthorn in it which\u00a0\nis incredible for the skin absolutely incredible\u00a0\u00a0\nso i love that it has that in it it also has a\u00a0\ntype of triple peptide for collagen production\u00a0\u00a0\nso in the product description it basically\u00a0\nis just a heavier version of the day cream\u00a0\u00a0\nso you really could just use a little bit more\u00a0\nof the day cream and call it a day or a little\u00a0\u00a0\nless of the night cream and use it during the day\u00a0\nyou know what i'm saying so i didn't necessarily\u00a0\u00a0\nneed both of them um but that is just the set\u00a0\nthat i got plus the eye serum now let's break\u00a0\u00a0\nthis down just a touch okay it to me what this\u00a0\nline is about a it's about gorgeous packaging\u00a0\u00a0\ni mean it's been sitting out on my counter because\u00a0\ni think it's so beautiful there's not a lot that\u00a0\u00a0\nsits on my counter like that i'm just gonna say so\u00a0\npackaging does get me sometimes um i don't think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat the price point is horrible for all of this\u00a0\nespecially right now they have a sale going 146\u00a0\u00a0\ndollars for all of this obviously minus the eye\u00a0\ncream don't think that's awful now we're talking\u00a0\u00a0\nabout a retinol this i would not go with a retinol\u00a0\nwith this brand i would stick to our regular\u00a0\u00a0\nretinols okay that we normally use and just pop it\u00a0\ninto this uh you know into this routine because i\u00a0\u00a0\nbasically do the same thing at night and i just\u00a0\nreplace it with my vitamin c with my retinol in\u00a0\u00a0\nit okay so and they do have exfoliating masks and\u00a0\ndifferent types of eye creams um they really have\u00a0\u00a0\nquite an array of different uh skincare in here\u00a0\nso it's not just these items it was just like\u00a0\u00a0\ni didn't know what else to get and i didn't want\u00a0\nto also spend another 38 dollars on like a firming\u00a0\u00a0\nserum which looks really good and then they\u00a0\nhave a blue face oil which has blue tansia in it\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich is all about for my acne sufferers um they\u00a0\nalso have a whole anti-aging line called the tbt\u00a0\u00a0\num anti-aging line as well um they have power\u00a0\npatches let's see what these are i didn't see\u00a0\u00a0\nthese see they're high what is these oh these\u00a0\nare blemish aids so these have salicylic acid\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're pads they're pimple pads that's smart\u00a0\nso they also have those i think pimple pads are\u00a0\u00a0\nfantastic they keep you from picking at your you\u00a0\nknow active acne you know what i mean i just think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat they're great okay so my overall consensus\u00a0\nis that this line is very obviously green\u00a0\u00a0\num vegan cruelty free facing right that's their\u00a0\nwhole thing they really rely heavily on the ewg's\u00a0\u00a0\nrating of each ingredient again ewg is unregulated\u00a0\nso it's for me it's like you need to take that\u00a0\u00a0\nwith a grain of salt but that's a big heavy that's\u00a0\na big play into her brand because it's all over\u00a0\u00a0\nthe website and it basically says like all of\u00a0\nthese products are number one on the ewg scale\u00a0\u00a0\ni really don't think that they're super overpriced\u00a0\num i think they're pretty i really do i know a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nof you guys are using dime beauty right now i know\u00a0\na lot of you guys are really into it and really\u00a0\u00a0\nloving it so um i would love to hear what your\u00a0\nfavorite products are from the brand it's just for\u00a0\u00a0\nme personally like i don't think that a cleanser\u00a0\nneeds to be this much money and plus it's just\u00a0\u00a0\na horrible smell so pick another cleanser i don't\u00a0\nthink the price for these is really that bad the\u00a0\u00a0\nmoisturizers but they're 1.7 fluid ounces would\u00a0\nprobably last you three to four months because you\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't need very much my out my the outstanding one\u00a0\nin this whole line is their vitamin c it's a high\u00a0\u00a0\ndose vitamin c but done very gently really buffed\u00a0\nwell with great hydrating elements and hydrating\u00a0\u00a0\ningredients and i think that's just really\u00a0\nwhat we look for in a vitamin c is something\u00a0\u00a0\nlike that and again it being so lightweight and\u00a0\njust so diverse that every skin can use it it is\u00a0\u00a0\nmy standout product from this brand and from a lot\u00a0\nof brands it's definitely one of my 2021 favorites\u00a0\u00a0\nsince i started using this in 2021 all right\u00a0\nso let me know what you guys think let me know\u00a0\u00a0\nif you guys have tried these and i'll see you guys\u00a0\nin the next one let's look for me to you bye loves\nso\nyou",

I use the lash serum every night, and I think it\u2019s effective . Hyaluronic acid and hyper glow would probably be my favorites. Thirsty face mist is really nice . I use it my after my makeup as a setting spray . I also like their clean perfume . I think overall it\u2019s a very nice line for the price points.",

I have sensitive skin and the formulation in Hyper Glow is so mild, and leaves my skin hydrated and brighter. I have been using the Hyper Glow serum for about 2 months and I can certainly see a difference. It has Vitamin C and it&#39;s the right percentage for me, since as I said, I have sensitive skin.<br>I use Hyper Glow sometimes at night, but mostly during the day, underneath my Sun Block.",

        "transcript_text": "Hello! I'm WONJUNGYO, a makeup artist\nEveryone, spring is on our doorsteps already\nWhat does spring remind you of?\nReal cosmetics manias will be eagerly looking forward to spring\nBecause! Cosmetics brands are about to launch their spring collections\nToday I'm going to unbox SUQQU's 2022 Spring Collection\nWhich is my absolute favorite brand\nI'll show you\nhow to use it\nby mixing and matching the colors\nPerfect for a daily spring makeup\nThis collection's main product is\nThe Melting Powder Blush\nThere are eight in total\nAnd from No. 1 to No. 8, they all have different colors\nwhich will be launched until next year\nAnd there's SUQQU's best product\nSignature Color Eyes will come in three types\nThen there are four lipsticks\nThis in total will make up the spring collection\nIn particular, the Melting Powder Blush\nFrom my preview of it\nit has a very unique form\nIt's not powder nor is it cream\nIt's both at the same time\nSo the blush spreads very well\nShowing off its unique clear and natural pigmentation\nIt's not powdery\nAnd people who don't like cream blushers\nbecause the blushers were too oily\nfor them\nThey will like this!\nThis product doesn't have oiliness or sticky texture of cream\nIt just spreads\nIt feels powdery and like it has been coated on\nSo you can use it to your full satisfaction\nI fully recommend it\nAnother thing is that\nwhile spreading it on your skin, it gives a slight shimmer\nwhich makes your skin look healthier and clearer\nit even looks smoother\nThis is a natural, clear, shimmering\nand shiny blusher\nCoral\nPink\nAnd brown\nIt comes in different colors\nSo you can pick what you want\nThe blusher is softer when applied with a brush\nEven when using your hand, the color blends so well\nand naturally\nbeginners can use it easily and quickly\nto look natural\nSo, the form was my favorite part\nIt spreads well, so it lasts long\nThose who wanted to try a cream blusher\nbut couldn't because it felt too oily\nI think you will be fully satisfied with this product\nThe second item of the spring collection is\nSignature Color Eyes\nHonestly, I've used so many eyeshadows\nBut I like this product because\nit's clear and natural looking\nI like clear looking makeup\nthat doesn't look stuffy\nAnd SUQQU has products that satisfy my needs for such makeup\nI love clear and deep looks\nAnd SUQQU is reliable in that way\nIt has just the right amount of glitter!\nIt shines a light on my skin but not too much\nIf a shadow is powdery\ndry, or thick, it won't look natural\nSo it fails to look clear as a base layer\nBut SUQQU products all have the texture that sticks to your skin\nSo it's very clear and elegant\nand very natural\nThen there are glitter shadows\nAnd these glitters look so brilliant\nI like SUQQU shadows because they have clear and natural pigmentation\nAnd it's not powdery because it sticks well!\nBecause there are so many bright colors\nit's perfect for a daily makeup\nShadows aren't dark or matte, which darkens your face\nBut they have that SUQQU style of making you look elegant\nSo far I've shown you the SUQQU spring collection\nand described its products and colors\nSome of you may be thinking\n'So what's good for me?'\n'What do I need to buy?'\nOr similar questions like that\nSo I have a perfect combo for warm skin tones!\nA perfect combo for cool skin tones!\nHow to mix and match for a daily spring makeup that's perfect!\nHere is the daily spring makeup style!\nFirst, use the second color\nSpread the colorful coral evenly over your eyelids\nFor a beautiful natural color\nUse the first color, yellow gold shadow, on the aegyosal\nto give a hint of a bright warm color\nUse the fourth khaki shadow as the point color\nby blocking the front and back and giving a deep shadow\nLikewise, use the khaki shadow\non the under eye, between the lashes\nThis will make the under lashes look lush and your eyes deep\nUse a large artificial fiber blusher brush\nto color in your cheeks overall\nTo match the color tone, use the coral with drops of brown\nFor your lips and apply it widely\nUse No. 107 with orange yellow color\nto extend the outlines of the lips\nSo the entire lips look natural\nFirst use the second shading color\nFor shading the overall eyes to give a deeper look\nBecause there's no hint of red, this color is perfect as a shading color for cool skin tones\nFor a more interesting look, use the third orange color\non the double eyelids\nto give a mysterious look\nAgain, use the second shading color on the triangular zone for depth\nUse the ivory shimmer glitter shadow on the aegyosal\nto make your eyes look bright and spring-like\nThis method is popular these days\nDab at the front of your eyes for highlight\nFinally use the green color to draw the line up\nThis will create a mysterious look when the shading mixes with the green\nTap the cheeks lightly to clean up your base makeup\nUse a wide brush\nOr a brush that comes with the blusher\nUse the artificial fiber brush to apply the blusher lightly\nTo give a cool-tone look as a final touch\nUse a lilac highlighter\nTo add glow to the C-zone and the front of the eyes\nLikewise, use a cool-tone lipstick to mix in the colors\nWhile reviewing SUQQU products\nI shared many tips with you\nWas this video helpful?\nYou must absolutely try the new blusher\nIt's so pretty\nIf you don't often wear colorful makeup\nyou can just use the blusher to give color to your eyes\nor on the tip of your nose\nMaking your nose tip slightly red makes you look younger\nBy doing\ntone-on-tone makeup\nyour makeup will look brighter\nDo try it for yourself\nI'll be back with another helpful video\nGoodbye~",

        "transcript_text": "Hi everyone, it\u2019s me Heiley.\nToday, I\u201dll be introducing and showing you a face swatch of Hince\u2019s Second Face Foundation.\nA foundation that gives you comfortable perfection like that of your skin.\nHince\u2019s Second Skin Foundation.\nThis foundation has a light and comfortable skin like texture and detailed flaw coverage\nto create natural looking skin as if you were born with it.\nIt uses a light a light coating powder so your skin can breathe freely, \nand it contains amino acid derived ingredients so that your skin feels moist and comfortable.\nThe fine dual cover pigment particles work to provide a natural yet perfect blemish coverage,\nand it is said to be a foundation that sticks to the skin as if it seeps in, so it doesn\u2019t feel thick.\nIt\u2019s a slim fitting foundation with amazing adherence and lastingness \nso it seems perfect as a mask-proof foundation.\nIt comes in a total of five shades, from bright rosy light to natural neutral to a warm ivory shade.\nThe shades seem to be bright overall.\nHince states that these shades are recommended for tones from No. 17 to 24.\nApplying it directly to my face, it feels smooth and quite light.\nIt especially applies on very well with the brush that comes with it.\nI like the fact that I can barely feel it having any thickness at all, and that my skin feels very comfortable after applying it on.\nThe coverage also seems to be pretty good, so I\u2019ve been using it more often.\nIt provides natural and smooth looking skin and covers large-looking blemishes quite effectively.\nIn addition, it\u2019s said that if you layer it on, you can see a more definite coverage, so I applied it on again.\nIf it had a natural feeling when applied once,\nupon applying it on twice, the skin appeared more completely covered and clean.\nI mentioned earlier that Hince\u2019s Second Skin Foundation is a slim fitting foundation.\nBeing that it has a thin application and adequate coverage, \nI figured that it would help with covering dark circles, so I tried layering it on.\nIt applies on nicely without creasing even on the thin skin around the eyes,\nand I can see that it covers the dark circles neatly.\nI also really liked this point as well\nNow that I\u2019ve briefly introduced Hince\u2019s Second Skin Foundation.\nLet me try out all the colors one by one on my face to show you how they look.\nNo. 17 Porcelain.\nThis is the brightest shade with a bright rosy color,\nSo I would recommend it if you like creating a slightly lively and bright looking skin.\nThe shade isn\u2019t too bright, so it can be used for both No.17 and No.19\nThe tone goes well with cool colors.\nNo. 21 Ivory.\nThis is a warm No. 21 shade\nthat is slightly warm, so it gives off an overall stable tone.\nIt\u2019s a shade that seems to go well for those who use Neutral No.21\nso I would recommend it to those who like natural tones.\nNo. 22 Beige.\nBeige, which is recommended as a No.22 seems to work for those who use No.23 and enjoy going for a slightly brighter look.\nWhile the color is a bit more rosy than ivory\nit\u2019s a neutral shade that is not much red or yellow in tone\nwhich creates a pretty looking skin tone.\nNo. 23 Sand.\nSand which is recommended as No.23 seems to feel slightly warmer than Beige.\nIt\u2019s a stable tone that\u2019s does not look dull\nand goes well for those with No. 24 skin who prefers the bright skin tone of No.23.\nNo. 24 Buff.\nBuff is a natural feeling neutral shade with the calmest tone\nwhich looks suitable for No.24.\nCompared to the other shades, it looks a bit orange, \nwhich seems to create a healthier looking skin tone.\nSo, I\u2019ve applied on each shade one by one to show you how they look.\nAs I applied them to my face, the tones seem to have slightly dropped as they fixed on.\nTo be exact, rather than to say that they toned-down, it was more like it was being fixed to perfectly match my skin.\nStill, I think it would be best to check the tone after they\u2019ve been fixed to better distinguish the shades more accurately.\nThe shades looked much too bright for those with a calm skin tone when applied at first\nbut after they were fixed, they look slightly different from the shades I had saw earlier.\nIt would be best to check to see how the tone looks after it\u2019s been fixed when looking for a shade that suits you.\nAlso, I tested to see how it smears when it comes to wearing mask.\nAs it applies on smoothly with a silky finish, \nI thought it wouldn\u2019t smear as much as I would expect it to.\nUpon testing it out, as expected, it didn\u2019t smear much.\nWhile some of the base do get peeled off due to scratches made from the mask itself, it wasn\u2019t very apparent.\nNormally when scratched off parts look noticeable, I\u2019ll of course have to fix my makeup, \nbut as I don\u2019t think it was too obvious personally, I didn\u2019t feel that I had the need to fix my makeup.\nStill, since there will be times when a touch up will be necessary, I tried to fix my makeup.\nI find that fixing the makeup with your hands to be the cleanest and prettiest.\nI was able to see it looking the same as when I first applied it without any clumping or caking.\nI also tried using a cusyion puff, sponge, and brush to fix my makeup,\nIn the case of using a cushion puff and sponge, it actually feels like the base gets taken off.\nWhile the exclusive brush that came with the foundation works well on the skin, \nit can be a hassle to use when you\u2019re outside.\nSo upon trying to fix my makeup with my hand, I felt that it was a much better option\nAs it seems to apply on more neatly\nit is actually better to apply on the makeup with your hands when you\u2019re doing your morning makeup.\nThe lastingness was pretty good.\nI was able to see the smoothness of the initial application for a long time.\nMaybe because this is a slim fitting foundation, but I wasn\u2019t able to see much creasing.\nIn addition, there was no caking, so I was very satisfied.\nLike this, I\u2019ve completed my introduction of Hince\u2019s Second Skin Foundation.\nOverall, since it doesn\u2019t feel too oily and has a smooth finish, \nI believe that it would work well with all skin types.\nBut one slightly disappointment was that it can feel a slight bit dry if you\u2019re someone with dry skin like me.\nSo if you have dry skin,\nI recommend to moisturize your skin before using the Second Skin Foundation.\nThat\u2019s it for my video today.\nI hope you enjoyed this video\nIf you did, please press the like button.\nDon\u2019t forget to subscribe\nand leave a comment.\nI\u2019ll be back with another video next time.\nSee you next time.\nBye!",

look\u00a0\u00a0\nthat still looks really natural and really glowy\u00a0\num like you're not even wearing face makeup but\u00a0\u00a0\nwe do use face makeup in a very specific way\u00a0\nto get this look and it's also very light on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe skin but still gives pretty good coverage\u00a0\nfor those acne spots so if you want to see all\u00a0\u00a0\nof that very in-depth tutorial today just keep\u00a0\non watching oh you tell me stories you took me\nall right so my face is all clean we just cleansed\u00a0\nit so i'm gonna actually start with some skincare\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm going to give you guys a little skincare tips\u00a0\nin this makeup tutorial as well some of my secrets\u00a0\u00a0\nso let's zoom you guys in and get started so\u00a0\nreally the key i would say one of the main\u00a0\u00a0\nkeys to this look is your base your prep this is\u00a0\nso crucial and you want to be going in with like\u00a0\u00a0\nsuper hydrating nourishing products to give your\u00a0\nskin that glow from underneath so that when we\u00a0\u00a0\ndo that makeup it will look flawless so i've\u00a0\nreally been enjoying these um toners from frida\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're awesome the avocado relief toner\u00a0\nas well as the blueberry amazing i'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nuse the blueberry today i just started\u00a0\nusing this one so um i really love it\u00a0\u00a0\nand just gonna drop some out i already cleansed\u00a0\nmy skin and one of the cleansers that i've been\u00a0\u00a0\nusing recently is from inkylist they just\u00a0\nreleased it it's their hyaluronic acid one\u00a0\u00a0\nso good and it really does a good job at hydrating\u00a0\nthe skin without stripping it in a cleanser so\u00a0\u00a0\nreally enjoy that one and then i'm going to go in\u00a0\nwith some vitamin c you can never really go wrong\u00a0\u00a0\nwith vitamin c this is just going to help brighten\u00a0\nthe skin and this one is from the inky list\u00a0\u00a0\ni like this one because it's good for\u00a0\nmy sensitive skin it's not too harsh\u00a0\u00a0\nbut it does a good job of brightening the skin\u00a0\nhelping with acne scars and dark spots and then\u00a0\u00a0\nwe're gonna go in with some polyglutamic acid\u00a0\nthis has been like my new skincare and makeup hack\u00a0\u00a0\nit does such a good job at hydrating the\u00a0\nskin i think i like it a little bit more\u00a0\u00a0\nthan um hyaluronic acid even it's so good\u00a0\nand it acts as such a good makeup primer\u00a0\u00a0\ntoo kind of smooths out the skin so i love it\u00a0\nunderneath my makeup just apply it all over\nand of course like one of the top things that you\u00a0\nneed is a good moisturizer so i've been using this\u00a0\u00a0\none from hustlo hope i'm pronouncing that right\u00a0\nand this has panthenol and ceramides in it it's so\u00a0\u00a0\nnourishing to the skin i love it it gives my\u00a0\nskin everything it needs to make sure it's\u00a0\u00a0\nnice and hydrated and moisturized\u00a0\nand it makes my skin look so\u00a0\u00a0\nglowy love it i'm also going to hydrate the lips\u00a0\ni'm using the furrita um blueberry hydrating honey\u00a0\u00a0\nlip balm this is actually such a nice lip balm it\u00a0\nlooks like a little honey pot it's so hydrating\u00a0\u00a0\nand it smells like a honey and blueberry dessert i\u00a0\nlove it really good i want to make sure everything\u00a0\u00a0\nis looking really glowy you know that's kind of\u00a0\nthe theme we're looking for so that the skin looks\u00a0\u00a0\nreally beautiful on its own without that makeup on\u00a0\ntop and that way the makeup is going to sit really\u00a0\u00a0\npretty um and of course last step of the skincare\u00a0\nroutine spf this one is the force shield from hero\u00a0\u00a0\ncosmetics i love this it has a bit of that green\u00a0\ntint to it as you can see so it will kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nsoothe out my redness a little bit it's also zinc\u00a0\noxide base so it is acne skin safe and it looks\u00a0\u00a0\nreally nice on the skin too without like that\u00a0\nintense white cast that we all do not like all\u00a0\u00a0\nright so now while my skincare kind of sets into\u00a0\nthe skin i'm going to go ahead and do my brows i'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to use the milani um precision brow pencil\u00a0\ni like to just lightly fill in the brows nothing\ntoo intense just to kind of\u00a0\nfill in where there's sparse\u00a0\u00a0\nareas and to make them look a little bit\u00a0\nmore alike since they do not look like\ni'm gonna use the brow freeze from abh i\u00a0\nneed to get a new one of these this one is so\u00a0\u00a0\nold but still working for now and i'm gonna go\u00a0\nahead and use this to kind of set those brows\u00a0\u00a0\nin place so i kind of brush them up\u00a0\nand then with all those excess hairs\u00a0\u00a0\njust kind of bring them down a little so they're\u00a0\nnot crazy okay so now that i've kind of let that\u00a0\u00a0\nskin care soak for a little we're gonna prime the\u00a0\nskin i like to use two primers as you can see this\u00a0\u00a0\nis really about the base underneath the makeup\u00a0\nso first off i'm going to use the wet and wild\u00a0\u00a0\nimpossible primer this is a silicone free primer\u00a0\nthat actually still manages to smooth out the skin\u00a0\u00a0\nfill in pores everything like that really\u00a0\ngood one and i mostly concentrate this\u00a0\u00a0\nin my t-zone and then i'm going to take the\u00a0\nmilk hydro grip primer this stuff is a godsend\u00a0\u00a0\nso good at gripping your makeup so this i would\u00a0\nmore use when i want my makeup to really last\u00a0\u00a0\num which is today so i'm going to\u00a0\nuse it you don't have to use this but\u00a0\u00a0\nit's just like a plus you know because\u00a0\nit's literally like glue for your face\u00a0\u00a0\nso now we're actually gonna start on the makeup\u00a0\num the face makeup so we're gonna start off with a\u00a0\u00a0\nconcealer this is the elf hydrating camo concealer\u00a0\nin the shade fair warm i love this concealer\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause since it's hydrating it never looks cakey\u00a0\non me looks really really pretty on the skin and\u00a0\u00a0\njust sits really nice so especially for these\u00a0\nfull glam looks you want something that will still\u00a0\u00a0\nlook pretty on the skin and won't look too\u00a0\nmakeupy so i just take this on a little brush\u00a0\u00a0\nand you are just going to\u00a0\nspot conceal on your acne\u00a0\u00a0\nnot too much product don't try to cover it up\u00a0\nfully because working in layers here i take my\u00a0\u00a0\nfinger and pat it out and see how natural that\u00a0\nlooks like you could even just do your makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nlike this and have this really fine look where\u00a0\nit doesn't even look like you're wearing makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nbut you got that acne covered and of course i am\u00a0\na acne positivity advocate on all my platforms\u00a0\u00a0\nso i don't think you need to cover your spots\u00a0\never if you don't want to but i do like to do\u00a0\u00a0\nthese tutorials since i have kind of mastered how\u00a0\nto cover my acne and not make it look cakey so\u00a0\u00a0\nfor any of you that if you want to do\u00a0\nfull glam full coverage you can there's\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know just because you love your skin\u00a0\nand can embrace your skin doesn't mean\u00a0\u00a0\nyou don't like to do full glam\u00a0\nand full coverage makeup so\u00a0\u00a0\nboth are fine but i'm literally putting this on\u00a0\nany spots building it really lightly and padding\nand i just go in and anywhere i want\u00a0\ncoverage that's where i'm going to apply\u00a0\u00a0\nthis so basically with this technique we're\u00a0\ndoing the coverage underneath so then we have\u00a0\u00a0\na really natural beautiful skin finish in the\u00a0\nend without doing the full coverage all over so\njust kind of pick the spots\nwhere you want that concealing and before i move\u00a0\non to foundation i'm going to take the sephora\u00a0\u00a0\nsetting spray this is the 16 hour\u00a0\nwear and i'm just gonna spray\u00a0\u00a0\nagain this base is really important for this\u00a0\nlook you want to take your time with this\u00a0\u00a0\nthe rest of the makeup will go pretty quick after\u00a0\nnow it is finally time for the foundation i guess\u00a0\u00a0\nbut we're not using a foundation today we're\u00a0\nusing a tinted serum this is my new beauty trick\u00a0\u00a0\ni've been obsessed with these tinted serums this\u00a0\none is from l'oreal it's the hyaluronic tinted\u00a0\u00a0\nserum in the shade um very light and i've\u00a0\nalso been loving this one from trini london\u00a0\u00a0\nuh the bff rebalance tinted serum but i'm gonna\u00a0\nuse this l'oreal one today and the trick with\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is we're gonna be very light so i'm using a\u00a0\nsponge this one is from elf dot it on the face and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen i usually start on my cheek with the sponge\u00a0\nstart patting this in now with this tinted serum\u00a0\u00a0\nthe skin will look so natural and it will just\u00a0\nlike enhance your skin really it's not going to be\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know um full coverage like it's not going to\u00a0\nlook like heavy makeup at all it's going to be\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a very your skin but better type look and\u00a0\nit looks so luminous on the skin which i love\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm not trying to cover up my freckles\u00a0\nmy other spots any of that scarring really\u00a0\u00a0\neither that i didn't cover with the concealer i'm\u00a0\njust applying this over to create like a uniform\u00a0\u00a0\nbase so that you can tell that i have makeup\u00a0\non everywhere rather than random splotches of\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup like we applied with the concealer and it's\u00a0\nactually really easy to apply with a sponge and i\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't find the sponge absorbs all my product\u00a0\nwhich is nice too and another trick i've been\u00a0\u00a0\ndoing is i like to take my concealer and i like\u00a0\nto kind of take it right under the eyes like this\u00a0\u00a0\nfor a really lifting effect i just like this more\u00a0\nthan putting concealer directly under my eyes and\u00a0\u00a0\ni take my brush or sponge and kind of flick it\u00a0\nwhen i blend it out and then blend out the temple\u00a0\u00a0\ni just find it like lifts i really like this look\u00a0\nas we can see the skin looks really beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nbut it's not like full full coverage and i\u00a0\nthink that's one of the keys with this look\u00a0\u00a0\nis because if you're gonna cake on the makeup\u00a0\nyou'll see it it won't look good but this way\u00a0\u00a0\nwe have that really natural skin look so now it's\u00a0\ntime for blush contour shaping the face i'm going\u00a0\u00a0\nto be using my sister cosmetics bronze and shade\u00a0\nstick you guys already know the drill with this\u00a0\u00a0\nmy favorite and i just find cream products on this\u00a0\ntype of look work so much better because they just\u00a0\u00a0\nlook really natural they go under the chin there\u00a0\nget rid of my double chin they look really natural\u00a0\u00a0\nbut they blend well and i just go with that\u00a0\nwhole luminous look we're trying to achieve so\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is definitely my favorite to do you can use\u00a0\na brush or a sponge and i really like that this\u00a0\u00a0\ncontour stick has like a really nice bronzy side\u00a0\ntoo sometimes i'll use this too if i'm feeling\nextra fun i almost forgot the chin i did that once\u00a0\non my tic toc and i thought i was going to get\u00a0\u00a0\ncancelled for it for blush i like to keep it very\u00a0\nbright and youthful i love this rare beauty blush\u00a0\u00a0\nin the shade happy and definitely not shy of blush\u00a0\ni love it so this stuff's super pigmented too\nso don't be afraid of it well be\u00a0\nafraid if you apply too much but\u00a0\u00a0\nit also blends really nicely so you don't have\u00a0\nto worry too too much even if you apply a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can blend it out really well i find a sponge\u00a0\ndiffuses it more if you're using a brush use\u00a0\u00a0\nless product for sure but i like to take my\u00a0\nblush almost up into my temples a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nand for 2022 i've just really been\u00a0\nliking this more lifted blush look\u00a0\u00a0\nrather than like the whole sun kissed blush\u00a0\nlook so now to set the face this is also really\u00a0\u00a0\nimportant you want to use something that's very\u00a0\nlight and very finely milled my favorite product\u00a0\u00a0\nis the sister cosmetics it's you but i am\u00a0\nall out sadly it's my favorite powder ever\u00a0\u00a0\nit looks so natural on the skin um just makes\u00a0\nyour skin look very very smooth and kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nsmooths out that texture but i'm all out of that\u00a0\nso i'm going to use a milani loose powder today\u00a0\u00a0\nwith my sponge and i'm just going to press\u00a0\nthis like more in the t-zone i like to keep it\u00a0\u00a0\nnot heavy at all with the um powder actually\u00a0\ni feel like a few years ago my thing was heavy\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup with heavy powder just because i wanted to\u00a0\nkeep everything modified because i thought that\u00a0\u00a0\nlooked the best on my acne to mattify it and yeah\u00a0\nthat's true like you don't want to put glitter on\u00a0\u00a0\nit it will definitely accentuate texture but you\u00a0\nalso don't want to completely modify everything\u00a0\u00a0\nor else your skin will lose that like natural\u00a0\nskin finish which we're trying to kind of fake\u00a0\u00a0\nwith makeup here so that's it for powder like i'm\u00a0\nnot doing any more than that i do not want to lose\u00a0\u00a0\nany of that natural glow for highlighter i've\u00a0\nactually been obsessed with these nyx money heist\u00a0\u00a0\num like gold bars this one's in the shade rose\u00a0\ngold it's such a beautiful highlighter i don't use\u00a0\u00a0\nit all the time but because i'm doing more glam\u00a0\nmakeup today we'll pop her on and look how pretty\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm obsessed if you have more texture on your\u00a0\ncheeks i would probably skip this because\u00a0\u00a0\nit is pretty glittery but if you don't go crazy\u00a0\nit's so pretty so for the eyes i like to keep it\u00a0\u00a0\nvery very simple when i do this type of\u00a0\nlook but of course you can do full glam\u00a0\u00a0\nfor the eyes i like to bring a little more\u00a0\nenergy there i'm gonna use the milani um\nmost loved mattes palette and i'm gonna take the\u00a0\nshade salted caramel i'm gonna start blending\u00a0\u00a0\nthis in the crease now you can kind of do\u00a0\nwhatever you please for the eyes you can go\u00a0\u00a0\nmore glam i'm just gonna do my doing my makeup\u00a0\nfor the event i'm going to today dipping into\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shade cinnamon spice um so it's really up to\u00a0\nyou i'm gonna do like a semi semi bold look today\non the under eye nothing too crazy today\u00a0\nyou want to deepen up a little bit with\u00a0\u00a0\nthese two darkest shades right here and kind of\u00a0\nbring it out for some glitter i'm going to use\u00a0\u00a0\nthe um what's up beauty desert monsoon palette\u00a0\ni've been obsessed with this and i've never heard\u00a0\u00a0\nanyone talk about it i'm like such a good quality\u00a0\npalette and i'm gonna mix the shades desert rose\u00a0\u00a0\nand humidity these beautiful like pink and\u00a0\npurple sparkly shades they're just uh to die\u00a0\u00a0\nfor i love them and they look so pretty on the\u00a0\nlid i'm literally just gonna press them on with\u00a0\u00a0\nmy finger nothing like too precise today we're\u00a0\njust going for a very like pretty look you know\ni am going to define the eyes a little\u00a0\nbit with the shade thunder this deep brown\u00a0\u00a0\nand just very slightly\ncreate like a\nlittle wing almost mascara i'm going to\u00a0\nuse my x fiber from l'oreal step one you\u00a0\u00a0\nguys know the drill i've used this mascara and\u00a0\nliterally probably every makeup video i've done\u00a0\u00a0\nfor the past like three years i don't even know\nstep two\nto add in that volume i gotta say i love\u00a0\na bold lip so i'm gonna use this milani\u00a0\u00a0\nunderstatement lip liner in the shade sienna style\nand\nline the lips\ni'm going for more of that glossy look today\u00a0\num if i was going for matte i would have\u00a0\u00a0\nwiped off the lip balm we put down before\nbut i'm kind of using the lip balm with\u00a0\nthe lip liner and then i'm gonna use this\u00a0\u00a0\num lip stain from lip oil lip oil lip\u00a0\nstain from merit in the shade sangria\nand now just as important as the base was the\u00a0\nfinal setting spray is also super important\u00a0\u00a0\nso i like to use two i know i'm extra like that\u00a0\num so i'm gonna go in with the milani green\u00a0\u00a0\ngoddess cannabis sativa oil one\u00a0\nthis is so hydrating to the skin so\njust really gives that skin\u00a0\nthat like really beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nhydrated look at the end of the makeup i take\u00a0\nthis with me everywhere on a night out just\u00a0\u00a0\nto refresh the makeup when i need it and then\u00a0\ni'm going to take the sephora 16 hour wear too\nto make sure this makeup stays on all night long\u00a0\nall right guys and here is the finished makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nlook i feel glowy i feel ready to go and i feel\u00a0\nfull glam while we covered up my redness and stuff\u00a0\u00a0\nwithout my full skin being like a mask\u00a0\nright my skin you can still see it it looks\u00a0\u00a0\nlike there's movement um it looks natural still\u00a0\nbut it does look like pretty makeup and that's\u00a0\u00a0\nreally the goal of this so i hope this video\u00a0\nwas helpful if you're interested in this type\u00a0\u00a0\nof makeup look um and you know just an in-depth\u00a0\ntutorial like this from the skincare i applied

        "transcript_text": "i am terrified of bugs in general but there\nare two bugs that i'm not afraid of and they\nare big time skin care ingredients producers\nbees and snails we've covered propolis and\nhoney and skincare a while ago but this time\nwe're diving into the world of snails [Music]\nhi hello\nhappy new year and welcome back to my channel\nand if you're new welcome welcome my name\nis ray and if you don't know who i am that's\ntotally fine you can find out more about me\nhere on all social media platforms my skin\ntype is oily sensitive reactive and now that\nwe're deep in the winter season my skin is\neven more dehydrated than usual okay this\nis our first skincare review of 2022 it's\ncrazy because it feels like it was only yesterday\nwhen i uploaded my first skincare review content\non this channel today's video is made possible\nby style koreans try me review me program\nin this video i will review some of cosrx's\nnew range and products i've tested cosrx's\nproducts on this channel before so i'm not\ngoing to go into details of their brand last\ntime we looked at how honeybees acropolis\nis super beneficial for our skin except for\nthose who are nursing or pregnant of course\nthis time we're taking a look at another bug's\ncontribution to skin care yup snails specifically\nthe slime the snails produce i know it sounds\ngross but i promise you it's not what you're\nthinking snail newsen or also known as snail\nsecretion filtrate is the slime that snails\nproduce it contains hyaluronic acid copper\npeptides antimicrobials and much more and\nto answer a question no scientists don't just\nsnatch up a snail in their lab and squeeze\nthe snail juice out of these poor snails skincare\nlabs actually either farm snails or they have\nsnail secretion filtry imported from other\nsnail farms and these snails live in a very\nhealthy and peaceful environment the snail\nfarmers or the skincare lab scientists i think\nthat's what they're called they would collect\nthe mucin from the snails as they go about\ntheir day in fact these snails have to be\nkept in a very peaceful and healthy environment\nin order for them to produce good snail mucin\nbecause stressed snails secretion is not good\nsay that three times fast like it's so crazy\nstress snail secretion stress snail secretion\nstress sale protection the collected mucin\nis then filtered through the lab before they\nare ready for formulation so what do we just\nlearn that snail mucin is good and not ew\nno snails are ever harmed in the process of\ncultivating and harvesting snail secretion\nso without further ado let's get right into\nthe review of cosrx's advanced snail range\nwe gotta go slowly today because we're snails\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nlet's start with one of cosrx's most popular\nproducts at the moment their snail essence\ni've seen all these influencers talk english\nabout how great this advanced snail 96 museum\npower essence is and i've been really wanting\nto try it out this is a very thick essence\nand by that i mean thick it's clear and very\nvery viscous what makes this product outstanding\nis their very short ingredients list of only\n12 ingredients with snail mucin being their\nnumber one ingredient this essence contains\na whopping 96 of pure snail secretion filtering\nthat is unheard of but then again it's cosrx\nso it's expected i think the only other brand\ni've ever heard of using snail mucin as a\nkey and star ingredients is mison and even\nthey don't use 96 of snail secretion filtrate\n96 is very close to 100 this essence also\ncontains pro vitamin b5 aka panthenol which\nis an excellent hydrator for our skin it also\ncontains arginine which is an amino acid that\nhelps fight free radicals and support collagen\nproduction this essence is super gentle on\nthe skin and it has no fragrance so i think\nit is very suitable for all skin types for\nmy oily skin i did not notice any greasiness\nas a finish or even a shine after applying\nit it does take a while to really sink into\nyour skin because of how thick and viscous\nthe product is out of the bottle for dry skin\ntypes this is an amazing essence because it\nis truly hydrating for anyone looking to get\nthat plumping effect this essence definitely\ncan help you achieve that but if you're kind\nof tight on your skincare budget i would actually\nlook the other way because this essence costs\n25 it is a great investment for 100 milliliter\nof essence but definitely make sure you're\ncomfortable paying that price i really liked\nusing this essence the pump bottle makes it\nsuper easy to get the product out plus hygiene\nvery important my only complaint is that it\nis very sticky on your skin granted it's not\ngreasy it's not shiny but it is very sticky\nso i typically only use this essence at nighttime\nif you do want to use this essence during\nthe daytime and you want to get rid of that\nstickiness you can apply a very mattifying\nsunscreen or if you apply makeup i know some\nof you guys probably do i think that will\nkind of get rid of the stickiness of the essence\nso this essence is actually getting a 9 out\nof 10 from me moving on to my new love sheet\nmasks it's crazy to even say that out loud\nbecause those of you who know me know that\ni don't really like using sheet masks you\ncan ask my friend jess she's like the sheet\nmask queen and i'm just here like i don't\nlike shoe masks but i've definitely grown\nto love them over time as i try more sheet\nmasks and try more skincare products as always\nbefore we talk about this advanced nail news\nand power sheet mask i'm gonna give you guys\nthe asmr experience that you guys did not\nsign up for here we go\n[Applause] but nonetheless\nit's still pretty stimulating right i think\nthat's\nall right that's enough of that you guys are\nprobably like oh my god stop it this sheet\nmask is stretched in the snail essence that\nwas just talking about but the essence in\nthis mass pack is not as thick or gooey as\nthe actual essence i think if it were to be\nas thick as the essence it would be very hard\nto apply on your skin so the sheet mask has\none job and it is to hydrate our skin and\nit does that job perfectly it delivered anyone\nwho wants to pamper themselves on a friday\nnight after a long week of hard work would\ndefinitely want to give this sheet mask a\ntry for someone like me who has always been\nskeptical of she masks this product changed\nmy stance on sheet masks this is perfect for\ndehydrated and dry skin as it contains panthenol\nand hyaluronic acid as well as of course snail\nsecretion filtrate i also think anyone with\nsigns of premature wrinkles and fine lines\nwould actually find this mask really useful\ntill this day my all-time favorite sheet mask\nis the cell max noni energy and pool sheet\nmask and i think this snail museum sheet mask\nis celamax's biggest competition i've tried\ncosrx's full fit propolis sheet mask in the\npast and i didn't really like how that sheet\nmask dried out quickly this sheet mask however\nwas still very damp after the instructed 10\nto 20 minutes of use my only issue and this\ngoes for all korean sheet masks is that this\ndidn't fit my face it's not the only sheet\nmask that didn't fit my face i'm sorry i don't\nfit within the korean beauty standards of\nthe small face but seriously my face barely\nmade the cut when using this i had so much\nforehead left that were uncovered by the sheet\nmask and the mouth and eye openings were very\nvery small besides that i really liked using\nthe sheet mask it was so gentle and it left\nmy skin with a very plump and glowing effect\nnot to mention how it just erased all the\nfine lines around my smile lines my forehead\ni have like these train tracks that my dad\ncalls train tracks between my eyebrows and\nthis one kind of just lifted it away without\na doubt this sheet mask is getting an 8 out\nof 10.\nsimilar to the 96 snail mucin power essence\nthis moisturizer is also jam-packed with the\ngood stuff i don't know why this is called\nan all-in-one cream because i don't see this\nbeing used anywhere else i guess maybe in\nmy neck but then again i use all my moisturizers\non my neck as well so don't really know why\nit's all in one but it's a moisturizer that's\nit at first glance it seems to be a watery\ngel cream once you see how stretchy it is\nyou just know it's going to be thick so the\nessence contains 96 of snail mucin or snail\nsecretion filtrate and this moisturizer contains\n92 percent of it cosrx is not stingy at all\nwhen it comes to giving their customers the\nbest ingredients in the most amount i want\nto say this all-in-one cream or moisturizer\ncontains panthenol hyaluronic acid just like\nthe other products but it also contains adenosine\nwhich helps fight wrinkles so panthenol hyaluronic\nacid adenosine and snails circulation filtrate\ndefinitely becomes like a powerhouse to really\nsteamroll our skin to flatten out all the\ncreases and folds and wrinkles this cream\ndoes contain a dimethicone which is technically\nsuitable for all skin types but there are\nstill some people out there who may react\nto this moisturizing agent i also noticed\nhow this moisturizer really helps restore\nthat bounciness of my skin anyone with crow's\nfeet or fine lines would definitely really\nlike this product so my personal experience\nwith this all-in-one cream or this moisturizer\nis that after about using it for only one\nweek i noticed that youthful plumpiness and\nthat glow on my skin i thought all snail products\nwould by default kind of give you that stickiness\ntackiness and greasy finish but i was really\npleased to find out that this one gives me\na very soft non greasy and a very light finish\neven though it's a very thick cream it sits\npretty lightly on your skin you barely even\nnotice that you have a moisturizer on i didn't\nnotice any acne outbreaks even though i applied\nlike a very thick layer of it so that's definitely\na major plus in the past when i tested out\ntm's signature a plus cream i didn't like\nhow they formulated dimethicone in their moisturizer\nbecause it created a film across my skin this\nmoisturizer however did not do that and i\nsuspect it's the way cosrx formulated the\nsilicone cosworks was able to formulate the\ndimethicone with the other ingredients to\ngive us a more comfortable finish on our skin\nand i really respect that i love that there's\nno fragrance in this product however i have\nto say this you will notice that dimethicone\nsmell it's that very plasticky smell that\nyou normally would smell from silicone or\nanything that's plastic so keep that in mind\nbecause it is very noticeable the application\nprocess oh my gosh this is like the biggest\nnegative for me it is super tricky to put\nthis on since cosrx doesn't provide a spatula\nor a spoon with this moisturizer you have\nto dig your fingers into the tub gross and\nwhat's difficult is that the nature of snail\nmucin is very sticky stretchy and almost like\nnatto beans or even straight-up elmer's glue\nand it becomes really hard to dab your face\nor massage it into your skin because you find\nthese strands of snail mucin so applying the\nscreen really requires some motor skills to\navoid the cream from flipping dripping and\nslipping in all sorts of directions overall\nit's a really well formulated moisturizer\nand i'm gonna give this [Music] an eight out\nof ten all cosrx really need to do to improve\nthis moisturizer is to give us that spatula\ni think i finally found my favorite eye cream\nof all time and it only costs me 28 dollars\nthis is cosrx's advanced snail peptide eye\ncream let me start with the packaging i love\nwhen eye creams come in pump bottles it's\na little excessive for an eye cream but it's\nalso very convenient this pump bottle has\ntwo levels of dispense a gentle pump would\ngive you just the right amount of product\nfor each eye area a hard and long pump would\ngive you a stream of eye cream which you don't\nwant to do when i tried to shoot the b-rolls\nfor this product i didn't realize this pump\nhas two levels so basically i wasted a lot\nof product during that shoot i should ask\ncosrx if they can send me another bottle of\nthis because i feel like it's pretty much\ndown here at this point we have snail mucin\nas the number one ingredient on this list\nthere's also sunflower seed oil which is very\nnourishing without that heaviness there's\nalso niacinamide in this eye cream and i know\na lot of you guys do not like nice and mine\nbut i love it this eye cream is packed with\nfive types of peptides i feel like we don't\ntalk enough about peptides anymore peptides\nare great collagen boosters for our skin for\nanyone looking to restore that elasticity\naround the eye area this is a great eye cream\nfor that this eye cream actually does leave\na very sticky finish on your skin opposite\nthe all-in-one cream so if you're someone\nwho is really not into that sticky feeling\naround your eye area then you might want to\nskip out on this one for people like me who\nhave dark circles this might be the solution\nfor that problem personally i feel like the\nonly way to really get rid of dark circles\nis sleep that's really the only tried and\ntrue method but since i can't achieve that\nthis eye cream would have to do for now in\nthe past i've always said that eye creams\nare never really essential to an effective\nskincare routine and i still stick by that\nbut as i get older i don't mind testing out\nor even trying some more eye creams i feel\nlike there's nothing for me to lose but so\nfar this eye cream is an eye cream that i\nreally genuinely like using at nighttime eye\ncreams are some of the products that require\na little bit more time in order to see results\nand i feel like my two to three week trial\nperiod was not long enough for me to determine\nwhether or not this peptide eye cream is truly\naffected so for now i'll rate this advanced\nsnail peptide eye cream a 7 out of 10 but\ni'll also update you guys on my results either\nin the comments section or the description\nbox that is it for this review overall i really\nenjoyed the advanced snail range i think for\nsome people the stringiness and the stickiness\nand the stretchiness of some of these products\nwould definitely take some time to get used\nto literally all the products here have that\nstretchy consistency to them the essence and\nthe sheet mask are the two products that really\nimpressed me during this trial period i hope\nthis video helps clarify some of these products\nfor you i'll leave all the links in the downbar\nbelow for you guys to check out in case you\nguys are interested the links are affiliated\nand would help keep the channel going also\nlet me know which products from this range\nyou guys have already checked out or that\nyou guys would like to check out thank you\nsouth korean for sending me these products\nfrom calls rex to try and review\nplease help this channel grow by subscribing\nand sharing this video with your friends thanks\nfor watching and i'll see you guys next time\nbut until then be safe stay hydrated and most\nimportantly be gentle with yourself come back\nfor more\n[Music]",

                    "Hi, Robinson! I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Stearic acid is typically well-received by all skin types and normally would benefit dry/sensitive skin. However, like most products, there are always exceptions, and every individual would respond differently to specific ingredients. It wasn\u2019t comedogenic for me, and that\u2019s probably because my skin is compatible with this product and its ingredients.

        "transcript_text": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel\u00a0\nmy name is nikki larose and today we're\u00a0\u00a0\ndoing a date night inspired glam if\u00a0\nyou like watching makeup tutorials\u00a0\u00a0\nlike this don't forget to subscribe\u00a0\nto my channel and like this video\u00a0\u00a0\nlet's get right into foundation i'll be using\u00a0\nthe fenty eavesdrop foundation in number nine\ntaking my foundation on a painters palette\u00a0\ni'll be dipping in with my foundation brush\u00a0\u00a0\nand i'll be starting in the center of my face\nso i'm really buffing this foundation all\u00a0\nover my skin but in the areas that i want\u00a0\u00a0\na little more coverage i'm going to dip\u00a0\nback into that foundation and instead of\u00a0\u00a0\nbuffing that product on i'm going to\u00a0\nstipple it onto my skin where i need\u00a0\u00a0\nmore coverage so for me that's going to be\u00a0\naround my nose and a little bit more under my eye\u00a0\u00a0\nso that way when i go in with my concealer i use\u00a0\na lot less and then whatever is left over in my\u00a0\u00a0\nbrush which is a really small amount i'm just\u00a0\ngoing to gently graze over my eyelids just to\u00a0\u00a0\nhelp cancel any pigmentation and to even out my\u00a0\neyelids before i go in with my eyeshadow primer\nokay so now that's nice and blended i'm\u00a0\ngoing to start with my eyeshadow grabbing\u00a0\u00a0\none of my all-time favorites this is the nars\u00a0\nradiant creamy concealer in the color macadamia\u00a0\u00a0\neven though i used a little bit of that\u00a0\nfoundation even out my eyelids i still\u00a0\u00a0\nneed a little more coverage and a little more\u00a0\nbrightening before i go in with my eyeshadow so\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's why i'm going in with my concealer now\u00a0\nand i'm just gonna dot this across my eyelid\nand then taking a more dense kind of a\u00a0\nfluffy brush and just packing that on\nand then blending it out\nit doesn't have to be super technical i'm\u00a0\nnot trying to carve out my brow with this\u00a0\u00a0\nconcealer like i typically do i'm just\u00a0\ntrying to get more of a brightened effect\ni'm making sure i just buff out the edges\u00a0\nand i really bring it out towards my temple\u00a0\u00a0\nso it's well blended and i bring it\u00a0\ndown towards my tear duct as well\nusing one of my favorite translucent powders this\u00a0\none's from one size i'll be using this much later\u00a0\u00a0\nto set my under eye concealer but for now i'll\u00a0\nbe setting my eyelids before i go in with my\u00a0\u00a0\neyeshadow and with a fluffy brush i'm just going\u00a0\nto tap this on my eyelid to set my concealer\nokay eyelids are prepped now we're\u00a0\nready to do some eyeshadow i'll be\u00a0\u00a0\nusing the baked browns palette this is\u00a0\none of my all-time favorite palettes\u00a0\u00a0\nthis actually never leaves my\u00a0\nmakeup kit it's such a staple for me\u00a0\u00a0\nand i'll be taking the zueva 228 crease brush\u00a0\nand dipping into this first medium brown shade\nwith all my eyeshadow looks i really start\u00a0\nwith the crease color and then i build my\u00a0\u00a0\nlook from there so by using a nice natural\u00a0\nneutral tone like the one i have right now\u00a0\u00a0\nit's just a great foundation for\u00a0\nthe rest of my eye makeup look\nand then whatever's left over on my\u00a0\nblending brush i'm going to sweep it\u00a0\u00a0\nall across towards my tear duct\u00a0\nand towards the side of my nose\u00a0\u00a0\nbut really focusing the most of that\u00a0\ncolor on the outer corner of my eye\nnext i'm taking the same blending\u00a0\nbrush to dip it into the color right\u00a0\u00a0\nnext to it which is more of like\u00a0\na warm almost like a pinky brown\u00a0\u00a0\nand i'm really just layering this\u00a0\non top of that first brown shade\nnext i'll be applying a shimmer to my\u00a0\neyelid just something that's really\u00a0\u00a0\npretty and romantic and that way when the\u00a0\nlight hits you a certain way it just really\u00a0\u00a0\npops and looks beautiful i'll be using the\u00a0\nshade silk road from nars actually silk road\u00a0\u00a0\n2 with a small flat brush this one's from\u00a0\nmac and i'll be packing this on my eyelid\u00a0\u00a0\nbut before this hits my eyelid i'll be\u00a0\nwetting it very lightly with the milk\u00a0\u00a0\nhydro grip set and refresh spray and\u00a0\nwhat this is going to do is just make\u00a0\u00a0\nit more metallicy even more like poppy and\u00a0\nit's going to help with fallout as well\nthis color is beautiful dry\u00a0\nbut wet it's even more magical\ndo\none more layer\nnext i'm applying the bedroom black\u00a0\neyeliner from charlotte tilbury\u00a0\u00a0\nit wouldn't be a makeup tutorial\u00a0\nof mine if i did do somewhat of\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit of a cat eye so that's\u00a0\nexactly what i'm going to do right now\nbefore this has a chance to dry down\u00a0\ni'm going to go in right away and blend\u00a0\u00a0\nit out and really get that shape\u00a0\nthat i want before it dries down\u00a0\u00a0\nfocusing on looking straight ahead in my\u00a0\nmirror i'm going to start to blend that out\nokay now once the shape is pretty much where\u00a0\ni want to be i'm going to move on to this eye\ngoing back to my blending brush\nfor my next color i'll be using this gorgeous\u00a0\npalette from huda beauty this one is the wild\u00a0\u00a0\nchameleon and just using this beautiful like\u00a0\ndeep eggplant shade same brush i used to blend\u00a0\u00a0\nout my black eyeliner so i'll be using the\u00a0\nshade directly on top of my black pencil\nokay my eyeliner is complete now i'm\u00a0\ngoing to go in with a really small q-tip\u00a0\u00a0\njust clean it up and sharpen\u00a0\nthe edge just a little bit more\nbefore i do my mascara i'll be curling my lashes\ni'll be using the buxom cosmetics blackest black\u00a0\nmascara i'll be doing mascara first and then i'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to add a couple individual lashes where i\u00a0\nfeel like i need them when i'm applying mascara i\u00a0\u00a0\nreally like to get to the root of my lashes wiggle\u00a0\nit a couple of times and then pull it straight up\u00a0\u00a0\nthat'll help to maintain that curl that i put in\u00a0\nwith my lash curler and also help just define them\u00a0\u00a0\ndo the more separation it really makes\u00a0\na big difference so i'm going to get in\u00a0\u00a0\nthere and you'll see i'm going to wiggle\u00a0\nit across and then pull it straight up\u00a0\u00a0\nand then just kind of fan out the\u00a0\nedges using the tip of the mascara wand\nthis is where you can kind of get in\u00a0\nthere and get more like detailed work\ni'm almost like picking apart my\u00a0\nlashes with the tip of this wand\nfor some extra drama and flirty vibes\u00a0\ni'm going to add a couple individuals\u00a0\u00a0\nmore towards the end and just to kind of\u00a0\nadd a little more like of a wispy look\u00a0\u00a0\nmy favorite individual lashes are from\u00a0\na professional brand called monda studio\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich are sold in la and online they're a little\u00a0\nhard to find links for these but the ardell\u00a0\u00a0\nindividuals are just just as good and very similar\u00a0\nso i'll link those instead if you ever wonder why\u00a0\u00a0\ni don't link these it's because i can never find\u00a0\num a link for them so i'll be applying these with\u00a0\u00a0\nthe duo brush on lash adhesive so when i apply\u00a0\nindividuals i just take a couple from the pack\u00a0\u00a0\nput them on the top of my hand and i\u00a0\ntake them one by one and then apply them\nnow their lashes are on i'm\u00a0\ngoing to tightline with that\u00a0\u00a0\nsame black eyeliner from charlotte\u00a0\ntilbury just on the top lash line\nso i'm going to go back to that little\u00a0\nblending brush i used earlier for our eyeliner\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm going to take this and i'm going to just\u00a0\ngently drag a little bit of that black eyeliner\u00a0\u00a0\ni used in my waterline i'm going to kind of bring\u00a0\nit just out towards my tear duct just a little bit\nmove back into that deep burgundy shade\njust a little bit and basically repeat\u00a0\nthe same look i have my outer wing\u00a0\u00a0\nand then kind of make a little\u00a0\nmini wing on the inner part\nit's okay if it doesn't look\u00a0\nperfect right away because\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can easily go in and clean it up\u00a0\njust like we did with our outer wing\nnow i'm gonna go in with a q-tip\u00a0\nand just kind of fine-tune it\nwhen i'm dragging it out i want to make sure that\u00a0\ni'm not dragging that liner down which would make\u00a0\u00a0\nmy eyes look kind of sad i rather than that i'm\u00a0\ngoing to just kind of drag it straight across\ngoing back to my nars macadamia concealer\u00a0\ni'm going to start to finish my under eye now\nand then whatever's left over my\u00a0\nbrush i'm just going to use that to\u00a0\u00a0\nreally lightly highlight the center of my forehead\na little bit on my chin\nso i really like to press my concealer in under\u00a0\nmy eye that helps to maintain that coverage rather\u00a0\u00a0\nthan going in like really buffing it all around\u00a0\nyou really lose the coverage when you work that\u00a0\u00a0\nway so for me like i've mentioned before i need\u00a0\nthe most coverage under my eye as you probably\u00a0\u00a0\ncan see so when i'm applying it and when i'm\u00a0\nblending it i'm not trying to blend it to the\u00a0\u00a0\npoint where it's gone i'm trying to just press it\u00a0\nin to really lock in that coverage and maintain it\u00a0\u00a0\nand at the same time it will blend it too\u00a0\nit's just a different technique of blending it\nbefore i set my under i can see that i'm going\u00a0\nto start to work on the rest of my face like\u00a0\u00a0\nwarming up my complexion i'll be using one of\u00a0\nmy favorite products ever this is the tom ford\u00a0\u00a0\nshade and illuminate and intensity one\u00a0\ni'll be applying it with a real techniques\u00a0\u00a0\ncontour brush i love this little brush\u00a0\nso what i like to do first is get\u00a0\u00a0\na decent amount on my brush and then i'll take\u00a0\nit and i'll work that into the top of my hand\u00a0\u00a0\nand this just really helps the blending\u00a0\nprocess it helps to speed it up\nso for me personally for a lot of my clients i\u00a0\nreally like to go a lot higher with my contour\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts than you typically would like typically\u00a0\nyou would find the hollow of your cheek which is\nright here and that's where you start your contour\u00a0\nthat's fine but typically when you do start\u00a0\u00a0\nas low as that spot you end up taking\u00a0\nit even lower as you're blending it so\u00a0\u00a0\ni just like to start a little bit higher than you\u00a0\ntypically would naturally and then as i blend it\u00a0\u00a0\ninevitably it's going to go down a little bit\u00a0\nfurther than i want it to but it's not going to\u00a0\u00a0\ngo down too far if that makes sense so starting\u00a0\na little bit higher than you typically would\u00a0\u00a0\nand that way when you're applying\u00a0\nthis to the overall effect\u00a0\u00a0\nisn't just a contour it's more\u00a0\nlike a lifted and sculpted effect\nand then making sure i get it really close\u00a0\nto my hairline so you don't see any gap or\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know any any blank\u00a0\nspots where it's not blended\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm going back to the top of\u00a0\nmy hand and i'm just going\u00a0\u00a0\nstraight across my forehead just trying\u00a0\nto give myself a little more warmth\na healthy amount of color\nand when you're doing your forehead just something\u00a0\nto keep in mind is you want to think where the\u00a0\u00a0\nsun would actually hit you and that's the highest\u00a0\npoint of your forehead only so don't bring it past\u00a0\u00a0\nthis point keep it nice and high and\u00a0\nthen whatever's left over on my brush\u00a0\u00a0\nand on the top of my hand i'm just going\u00a0\nto take it just lightly underneath my jaw\ni don't think that i need contour here that's\u00a0\nnot what i'm trying to do i'm just trying\u00a0\u00a0\nto tie the whole look in and sometimes this\u00a0\nis all you need to do just to give yourself\u00a0\u00a0\nmore of a cohesive look to your\u00a0\nmakeup so don't forget your jawline\u00a0\u00a0\nnext up i'm going to highlight using one\u00a0\nof my favorites this is the pillow talk\u00a0\u00a0\nbeauty light wand this is a liquid highlighter\u00a0\nand it comes with a sponge applicator\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one is mine personally so i'm going\u00a0\nto use this to directly apply it to my skin\u00a0\u00a0\nand this gives such a gorgeous glow i am obsessed\u00a0\nwith these products i have so many in my makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nkit same brush i used to contour i'm going\u00a0\nto take this and just pat that product in\nso when you're using this product i really\u00a0\nrecommend that instead of blending it really\u00a0\u00a0\naggressively you're just going to tap it into the\u00a0\nskin when you're pressing this product into your\u00a0\u00a0\nskin you're maintaining that beautiful glowy\u00a0\neffect not diluting it by blending it too much\ngo back in and layer it just a little bit more\nbecause you want me extra glowy for date night\nand i'm just stippling it and\u00a0\npressing it up towards my temple\u00a0\u00a0\nand then whatever's left over i'm going to\u00a0\nstart to just hit that highest point at the\u00a0\u00a0\nside of my forehead and i'll show you why in\u00a0\na second and then hit the side of your chin\u00a0\u00a0\nso you can see when you get all these beautiful\u00a0\nhigh points of the face when you get that profile\u00a0\u00a0\nshot it's just so gorgeous it really picks up on\u00a0\nyour features it gives you that beautiful glow\u00a0\u00a0\nand it just really accentuates like i said the\u00a0\nhigh points of your face which are so gorgeous\nokay now that my highlighter is on and\u00a0\nit's blended i'm going to finally go in\u00a0\u00a0\nand set my under eye concealer dipping back\u00a0\ninto that one size loose powder that i used\u00a0\u00a0\nearlier on my eyeshadow base i'll be taking\u00a0\na fluffy powder puff this one's from nars\nso i'm taking a good size amount and i'm\u00a0\ngoing to work that in the palm of my hand\nreally working it into my puff but before\u00a0\ni actually apply this to my under eye i'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to make sure there's no creasing that\u00a0\nhappened since we took a long pause in between\nand since i'm using this on such a\u00a0\nsmall area and this is a larger fluffier\u00a0\u00a0\npowder pop and make sure i squeeze\u00a0\nit and kind of fold it in half that\u00a0\u00a0\nway i can really get in there and\u00a0\nmake sure i'm setting it properly\nand in order to really get in there you have to\u00a0\nmake some crazy faces and look up towards the sky\nso really quickly i just want to point out what\u00a0\na huge difference it makes powdering my under\u00a0\u00a0\neye versus not powdering my under eye for me i\u00a0\nthink it takes 10 years off of my my age i think\u00a0\u00a0\nit looks so much smoother it really helps to blur\u00a0\nfine lines that we have especially under our eye\u00a0\u00a0\nit gives it more of an airbrushed finish and i\u00a0\nthink i look way more well rested on this eye\u00a0\u00a0\nversus this eye so don't be afraid to set your\u00a0\nunder eye don't be afraid of putting powder under\u00a0\u00a0\nyour eye i think a lot of people think that\u00a0\nit's going to settle into their fine lines\u00a0\u00a0\nbut if you apply it properly like i just\u00a0\nshowed with this technique it's a game changer\nand you can see i'm applying that just\u00a0\nabove where that highlighter is so we're not\u00a0\u00a0\ndisrupting that highlighter it's still totally\u00a0\nintact we didn't powder it down so that's why\u00a0\u00a0\nyou really want to squeeze this and make sure it's\u00a0\nnice and small so you can get in there and not\u00a0\u00a0\nget the rest of your makeup that you don't want\u00a0\nto powder taking a little bit more i'm going to\u00a0\u00a0\nstart to hit my t-zone because we want glow but\u00a0\nwe don't want an overwhelming amount of glow\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm going to hit the center of my forehead\nand just above my brow\nget the side of my nose\nif you have oilier skin make sure you definitely\u00a0\nare setting your t-zone especially for a date\u00a0\u00a0\nnight you know you want to be glowy but you\u00a0\ndon't want to be like a disco ball of shine\u00a0\u00a0\nand then just a teeny bit in the center of my chin\nnot the side where we have the glow just\u00a0\nthe center and then i always go back and hit\nmy expression lines\nbecause just like under her eye this powder is\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna have a smoothing effect and\u00a0\nit's gonna help to smooth that area\nand go back to my highlighter one more time\u00a0\u00a0\ni forgot to highlight one spot and\u00a0\nthat's my favorite spot which is right\u00a0\u00a0\nhere i'm just gonna tap that on and then with\u00a0\nmy fingertip i'm just gonna press it down\nand you'll notice i'm leaving\u00a0\nthe very center of my nose\u00a0\u00a0\nwithout the highlighter and that way it's\u00a0\nnice and it's balanced and it's not too much\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing back to my baked browns palette\u00a0\nand that first brown shade that we use\u00a0\u00a0\non the crease i'm going to repeat those first\u00a0\ntwo colors actually on my bottom lash line\u00a0\u00a0\njust like i always do to\u00a0\ntie in the rest of the look\nand i'm gonna go back with that small\u00a0\nblending brush and that darker burgundy shade\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm just gonna tuck this into my bottom lash line\nto finish up my eye makeup just add a little extra\u00a0\npop i talk about these all the time i'm obsessed\u00a0\u00a0\nwith these it's the fenty beauty rose rave this\u00a0\nis the all over diamond balm highlighter i'll be\u00a0\u00a0\nusing this on the center of my eyelid just to add\u00a0\na little more sparkle and fun using my fingertip\u00a0\u00a0\nmy favorite tool for this kind of product i'm\u00a0\ngonna get a good amount on there and then i'm\u00a0\u00a0\njust gonna look straight ahead the sparkle that\u00a0\nthis gives off is just it's like nothing else\nnow that our lashes are totally dry i'm going\u00a0\nto go in with one more coat of the buxom\u00a0\u00a0\nmascara on the top and the bottom this\u00a0\ntime you can't forget bottom mascara for\u00a0\u00a0\na date night look it's just adds such\u00a0\na sultry sexy look to any eye makeup\nlet's move on to lips i'll be using the\u00a0\nhuda beauty lip contour and pinky brown\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is a great neutral just like it\u00a0\nsays it's a pinky brown it's spot on\u00a0\u00a0\nso you'll notice when i'm filling in my lips i\u00a0\nlove to go just straight across my cupid's bow\u00a0\u00a0\nthat actually gives me the look of a fuller\u00a0\nupper lip which i really like i think it looks\u00a0\u00a0\nreally pretty so rather than following my actual\u00a0\ncupid's bow and making it sharp and more angular\u00a0\u00a0\ni don't like that look on myself personally so\u00a0\nthat's why i just go straight across and i almost\u00a0\u00a0\nfill in that hollow of my cupid's bow to\u00a0\ngive my upper lip more of a rounded look\ni'll be using a liquid lipstick for our date night\u00a0\ntheme just because i think it's more fitting you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow rather than like putting a glossy lipstick\u00a0\non that could potentially get on your date\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm gonna skip that and do a liquid matte\u00a0\nformula this is one of my favorite liquid\u00a0\u00a0\nmatte formulas this is from dose of\u00a0\ncolors and it's the color nude chica\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm gonna take the applicator and just\u00a0\nsqueeze off a little bit of the lipstick\nnow i'm going to take my fingertip\u00a0\nand dab on more of that lipstick\nlast but not least i'm going to add\u00a0\njust a little bit of powder blush\u00a0\u00a0\ni kind of debated on not applying blush\u00a0\nat all for this look because i love\u00a0\u00a0\nthe focuses really on the eyes the eyes are\u00a0\nstrong and they're more sexy and sultry and\u00a0\u00a0\nthe lip is kind of focused as well so by throwing\u00a0\na blush in there it's kind of like too many cooks\u00a0\u00a0\nin the kitchen but this blush in particular\u00a0\nis so neutral kind of goes with anything it's\u00a0\u00a0\nreally nice and natural so i'm just going to\u00a0\nadd a little bit of this blush to my cheeks\ndo\nto set my glam and to make sure that\u00a0\neverything stays in place throughout\u00a0\u00a0\nmy entire date night i'll be grabbing the same\u00a0\nmilk hydro grip set and refresh setting spray\u00a0\u00a0\nso here's my finished look this is my date\u00a0\nnight glam i think it's soft it's sexy it's\u00a0\u00a0\nsultry it's got all the things you want\u00a0\nfor a date night including a lot of glow\u00a0\u00a0\nand like a smokey eye but it's not just good\u00a0\nfor a date night you can use this for so many\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent occasions including a wedding this would\u00a0\nbe a beautiful bridal look or if you're a wedding\u00a0\u00a0\nguest i think this is beautiful as well or if\u00a0\nyou're just attending a nighttime event definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nrecommend trying this look out if you love makeup\u00a0\ndon't forget to follow me on instagram as well i'm\u00a0\u00a0\nat makeup by nikki larose and if you like\u00a0\nthis makeup look give it a big thumbs up\u00a0\u00a0\nleave me a comment if you have

                    "@Claru Beauty We certainly are! I&#39;ve really enjoyed your videos. At 53yrs young, I simply can&#39;t watch those youngsters attempt to use make-up like they&#39;re using a recipe from a cookbook on other Channels. They do the same look over and over and can&#39;t see that make-up can be used in so many ways. They pack so much shadow on their eyes without giving a thought to those of various ages, who wear glasses, have hooded lids etc. I don&#39;t know how they would ever survive without setting spray, glitter glue and still dont wet their brushes either. They also use those terrible camera lights and we never get to see any looks from natural light. They forget that we have so much more experience than they do and have had to work with much harder products than they could comprehend. Who had ever heard of an eye shadow base back in our teens? I used foundation over mine. They simply don&#39;t realise how good they have it but they aren&#39;t moving forward in any way with everything laid out at their feet. Makes me laugh. It&#39;s a joy to watch your videos and glad I finally found them!\ud83d\udc96",

                    "@Claru Beauty Australia. In the northeast of the State of Victoria to be precise. Being a rural area, there aren&#39;t any shopping centres close by who sell luxury make-up and with COVID, shops are closing up as they can&#39;t afford to stay open. There is one small department store about an hour and a half away but they don&#39;t have much on display. I&#39;m also not able to drive due to breaking my arm in three places in the last few days of September and still stranded at home recovering. You&#39;d laugh at all the online shopping I&#39;ve been doing, especially the make-up which I&#39;m only beginning to be able to use again! The best I can do is watch videos like yours or get samples from each brand. It does get rather tedious. Thanks for asking though but if there is a will, there&#39;s a way! Kris.\ud83d\udc96"

but in like 10 years i've never\u00a0\u00a0\ndone sophia lauren so here we are i hope you\u00a0\nguys enjoy this look and i didn't use historical\u00a0\u00a0\nhistorically accurate products but i did pick a\u00a0\nbunch of modern products that have a very vintage\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel to them so hopefully you get some inspiration\u00a0\nfor new beauty products if you're looking to shop\u00a0\u00a0\nand i hope you guys enjoy thumbs up if you do\u00a0\nand subscribe for more pop culture videos and\u00a0\u00a0\nlet's get into it a big part of sofia's look in\u00a0\nthe arabesque shower scene is her gorgeous tan\u00a0\u00a0\nso i've applied loving tan and dark and we\u00a0\ncan't forget skin care i've been loving her\u00a0\u00a0\nbefore it is kind of expensive but i got hooked\u00a0\non their face oil and make sure you are just\u00a0\u00a0\nvery hydrated as well as your under eye area\u00a0\nthis will always help with makeup application\ni recently got the armani beauty\u00a0\nluminous silk hydrating primer\u00a0\u00a0\napplying that to the skin and then i\u00a0\nwas planning on using the armani silk\u00a0\u00a0\nfoundation but i decided i didn't need as much\u00a0\ncoverage and i went with rare beauty instead\u00a0\u00a0\ni love this foundation and a beauty\u00a0\ntip from sophia loren is to have\u00a0\u00a0\na tan so you can skip out on foundation but\u00a0\nsun damage is real so i went with a fake tan\nand then to try to emulate her beautiful bone\u00a0\nstructure i took an og product the maybelline\u00a0\u00a0\nage rewind concealer highlighting my chin in\u00a0\nkind of a square shape as well as my jawline\u00a0\u00a0\nand you really want to highlight the\u00a0\ncenter of your face the ball of the\u00a0\u00a0\ncheek up the cheekbone for a sofia inspired look\nto make the contour bold but still\u00a0\nseamless i'm gonna layer products\u00a0\u00a0\nfirst a tiny bit of the too faced born this\u00a0\nway concealer in honey and i have a video with\u00a0\u00a0\ntoo faced over on their channel where i use these\u00a0\nconcealers so i'll have it linked in the cards and\u00a0\u00a0\nthe cheekbone shape is high through the top and\u00a0\nthen lower in a rounded shape towards the mouth\nspeaking of really cute vintage inspired products\u00a0\nthis is the pretty vulgar powder and it comes with\u00a0\u00a0\nthis adorable pink powder puff really fun to use\u00a0\nand it sets the face really nice i used a touch of\u00a0\u00a0\nchanel bronzer to try to blend in where i drew on\u00a0\na fuller hairline and then the kevin aquan contour\u00a0\u00a0\npowder again building up little by little you can\u00a0\nof course skip contouring steps just enhance your\u00a0\u00a0\nown features however you like i just do this\u00a0\npart for fun as a bit of a challenge to try to\u00a0\u00a0\nlook more like whoever i'm recreating but we are\u00a0\ndifferent ages i have a very round face shape so\u00a0\u00a0\nit won't be exact but still fun to try and then\u00a0\nthe nose contour i like to do a little shadow\u00a0\u00a0\nunderneath when anyone has a longer nose than i\u00a0\ndo if you want to go more intense you can also\u00a0\u00a0\nenhance your nostril shape but obviously this\u00a0\none is not a daily step i'm just trying to get\u00a0\u00a0\nthat iconic sofia look i really like her nose\u00a0\ni think it really stands out and then with the\u00a0\u00a0\ncharlotte tilbury highlight in spotlight add to\u00a0\nthe cheekbones nose and chin and then brows sophia\u00a0\u00a0\nshaved hers off and then would draw a little\u00a0\nupward strokes to create a full shape my brows\u00a0\u00a0\nare pretty full so how i'm recreating this look\u00a0\ni'm gonna add a couple strokes at the front of the\u00a0\u00a0\nbrow because mine start a bit lower and that way\u00a0\nyou'll see some of that feathery effect but too\u00a0\u00a0\nmany of these strokes throughout my natural brows\u00a0\nand they end up looking too bold so i'm brushing\u00a0\u00a0\nthem up popping in some hazel contacts that are\u00a0\nappearing a bit more green over my blue eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nand let's move on to the eye makeup first step\u00a0\nyou want to use white liner or if you want to\u00a0\u00a0\ngo less bold you could use a champagne shade or a\u00a0\npeach and draw from the water line up towards the\u00a0\u00a0\ntail of your drawn on brow i mainly use this\u00a0\ndior palette and with the matte latest shade\u00a0\u00a0\nback onto the brow bone and then taking the matte\u00a0\ngray shade and a bit of the peach i'm blending\u00a0\u00a0\ninto the first half of the crease it's picking up\u00a0\na bit warmer and it's nice to have a slight bit of\u00a0\u00a0\nwarmth when working with grays and taupes all over\u00a0\nthe lid i'm using the deepest shade in the palette\u00a0\u00a0\nand sophia would use a cream black all over the\u00a0\nlid but i'm not a big fan of using cream shadows\u00a0\u00a0\non myself i feel like powder i just have way more\u00a0\ncontrol i prefer to build it from light to dark\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is how i went about it taking the taupe\u00a0\nand packing onto the lid and then when i get\u00a0\u00a0\ncloser to the crease i'm bringing in a bit more\u00a0\nof a silvery taupe shade blending towards the wing\nyou want to keep the depth on the lid closer\u00a0\nto the lash line and i'm not blending too far\u00a0\u00a0\nup you want to have the brow bone appear bright\u00a0\nin contrast to the deeper lid now that i have\u00a0\u00a0\nthe base shade go with a matte black shadow and\u00a0\ndraw a line from above your outer corner crease\u00a0\u00a0\nin a straight line into the center of your crease\u00a0\nand blend this black closer to your lash line\nalso add some of the matte black smoked under the\u00a0\nwhite liner and now it's time for bold gel liner i\u00a0\u00a0\ndecided to go with this one by pretty vulgar again\u00a0\nlook at how cute this packaging is it totally\u00a0\u00a0\nreminds me of harry potter and follow that white\u00a0\nline again starting to build up through the center\u00a0\u00a0\nand i found this product was really easy to\u00a0\nuse but i haven't seen how long the gel lasts\u00a0\u00a0\nso if you have tried this one out let me know how\u00a0\nlong it's lasted you i'm gonna make sure i really\u00a0\u00a0\nkeep that lid on there with the tiny pointed\u00a0\nbrush creating a point in the inner corner\u00a0\u00a0\nwith more of that gel black liner accenting\u00a0\nthe inner tear duct and then following really\u00a0\u00a0\nclose to the bottom lash line and flicking upwards\u00a0\nunderneath the white liner connecting to the upper\nwing with the black again i'm\u00a0\ndeepening up that outer corner\u00a0\u00a0\nmaking sure right under the bottom wing that\u00a0\nit smoked out a bit but that the black line\u00a0\u00a0\nisn't too thick or harsh it's definitely\u00a0\nheavier on the top lid than the bottom\nusing my favorite barbie lash curler i love barbie\u00a0\ncollabs and you want to get as much curl as you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan before going in with mascara this is the gucci\u00a0\nmascara i use it pretty much every day layering\u00a0\u00a0\nthis on the top and bottom lashes and with the\u00a0\ntop lash line the middle lashes to fan upwards\u00a0\u00a0\nand have a lot of curl i've done a couple coats\u00a0\nand apply a set of outer corner lashes that start\u00a0\u00a0\nright after the middle of the lid so you still see\u00a0\nthose fanned out natural lashes and then tilt the\u00a0\u00a0\nend of the band slightly upwards following\u00a0\nthe gel liner and not your actual eye shape\nthis will extend the eye shape make them look\u00a0\nwider more almond shaped while the lashes are\u00a0\u00a0\ndrying before i add more mascara let's do the\u00a0\nlip shape go with the bold v and i over lined\u00a0\u00a0\nmy top lip a little bit since in my case my top\u00a0\nlip is quite a bit smaller and then extend your\u00a0\u00a0\nlip line a bit further than your bottom lip this\u00a0\nto me reminds me of mila kunis for some reason\u00a0\u00a0\nand then i'm lining my bottom lip i actually think\u00a0\nthey look quite a bit alike in this shot anyway\u00a0\u00a0\nand you can go two directions with a lip look\u00a0\nfor the actual scenes i was watching her lips\u00a0\u00a0\nlooked very vibrant peachy pink with a gloss but\u00a0\nthen in still photos they looked very pale peachy\u00a0\u00a0\nnude so i'll show both i went with sunset lover by\u00a0\ncharlotte tilbury because it's quite bright on me\u00a0\u00a0\nand sophia liked to use lipstick on her cheeks\u00a0\nso i decided to use the same lipstick as blush\u00a0\u00a0\nand then a pink gloss from scott barnes\u00a0\nto add more pink to the peachy lip\u00a0\u00a0\ni'll have this towel set that i'm wearing linked\u00a0\ndown below from amazon and i love the bathroom in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe scenes that i'm inspired by comment bathroom\u00a0\ngoals is the pop culture password and keep on\u00a0\u00a0\nwatching because i wanted to share how you can\u00a0\ncreate a retro sofia loren hairstyle to go with\u00a0\u00a0\nthis look we're not going to keep it in the\u00a0\ntowel and here's the second lip combo because\u00a0\u00a0\nin the scene it definitely looks peachy pink all\u00a0\nthe way through but in this very famous photo her\u00a0\u00a0\nlip looks very nude a pigmented gloss this is too\u00a0\nfaced lip injection glossy in the shade milkshake\u00a0\u00a0\nand applying that to my lips my favorite nude\u00a0\nlipstick is nude kate but i wanted to go with\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething a bit lighter and in this version\u00a0\nyou're seeing because i did film this on two\u00a0\u00a0\nseparate days i deepened up the eye with more\u00a0\nblack liner a bit more black shadow to the lid\u00a0\u00a0\nand now let's take off the head towel and as\u00a0\nyou can see i stuffed it with toilet paper\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is so it had a fuller\u00a0\nappearance um like a thick towel\u00a0\u00a0\nand let's see what we can do with this messy bun\u00a0\ni found this really unique top i wish it wasn't so\u00a0\u00a0\nshort of a crop top but in arabesque she wears\u00a0\nthis sheer black dress that has like feathers\u00a0\u00a0\nat the bottom and i thought the sleeves kind\u00a0\nof gave the same vibe so i'll have it linked\u00a0\u00a0\ndown below if you like this top and all you got\u00a0\nto do is put your hair in a super high ponytail\u00a0\u00a0\ni fill in my hairline by the way i'll use a\u00a0\nmatte dark shadow and then i'm going to pull\u00a0\u00a0\nup the top of the pony for a bit of a volume at\u00a0\nthe front here's the photo that i'm referencing\u00a0\u00a0\nand this is really similar to another recent 60s\u00a0\ntutorial you loop a piece of your ponytail forward\u00a0\u00a0\nand create a bit of a pin curl pin on either\u00a0\nside with bobby pins so that it stays in place\u00a0\u00a0\nnow we have all this length left over so create\u00a0\nanother pin curl and shorten your hair as much\u00a0\u00a0\nas you can so that you're left with one hanging\u00a0\npiece that is going to become a bang like section\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm curling my hair with the barbie steam pod\u00a0\nby revlon and i love this thing especially to\u00a0\u00a0\nstraighten my hair it's so fun to use i love that\u00a0\nit's pink i have a really low setting on here so\u00a0\u00a0\nit's not like giving it a perfect curl or anything\u00a0\nbut i just use a bit of heat curve it in and then\u00a0\u00a0\nset with hairspray before creating another pin\u00a0\ncurl with a curved end for that front detail\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's like two curls on each side\nand the rest of the style create a bit of teasing\u00a0\nand create loops making sure that you pin on\u00a0\u00a0\neither side of the loop around your head so you\u00a0\nget a big fanned out bun but the pin curls lay a\u00a0\u00a0\nbit further down to the back and sides of your\u00a0\nhead it could have been a french twist at the\u00a0\u00a0\nback i'm not sure i just completed it with these\u00a0\nloops and it looks like a bun up top at the front\u00a0\u00a0\nbut the sides kind of taper down so you\u00a0\ndon't get a distinct bun shape all around\u00a0\u00a0\nthese thrifted earrings have come in handy i\u00a0\nwore them in the ariana grande rem beauty review\u00a0\u00a0\nand i wore them in several videos now but they do\u00a0\nhurt and you can always find really cute vintage\u00a0\u00a0\njewelry on etsy or poshmark that's my favorite and\u00a0\nif you want to see more hair inspiration check out\u00a0\u00a0\nthe three heatless hairstyles with black bows that\u00a0\ni did super trendy right now or if you're looking\u00a0\u00a0\nfor more of a modern makeup look check out this\u00a0\nkendall jenner inspired tutorial i did last

bad\u00a0\nchick energy vibes on instagram that we all know\u00a0\u00a0\nand see i'm fully aware that there\u00a0\nare apps that can accentuate the look\u00a0\u00a0\nbut like love that for everyone there is\u00a0\nthat like vibe that like i see it's like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe smokey look the smokey eye shadow the\u00a0\nnude brown lip the really heavy contour and\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlight that i just love and i feel like\u00a0\nit photographs so nicely and like why not\u00a0\u00a0\nso i created my technique and version of that\u00a0\nlook in today's video and i wanted to share\u00a0\u00a0\nwith all of you it's pretty heavy i go in pretty\u00a0\nintense with like the contour but just trust the\u00a0\u00a0\nprocess the outcome does look like this if you're\u00a0\ninterested in learning kind of my go-to instagram\u00a0\u00a0\nand tick tock makeup look that i feel videos and\u00a0\nphotographs really nicely then please continue to\u00a0\u00a0\nwatch this video all right here we are bare skin\u00a0\ni have done my eyebrows already with the anastasia\u00a0\u00a0\nbrow wiz just because it takes a little bit longer\u00a0\neveryone does their eyebrows differently what i'm\u00a0\u00a0\ninto right now is kind of a darker thicker brow\u00a0\nwith a little bit of an arch so the eyeshadow\u00a0\u00a0\nis actually very simple i'm just going to do like\u00a0\na brown smokey eye that anyone can really master\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm grabbing this vise art eyeshadow palette\u00a0\nthis is their neutral matte eyeshadow palette\u00a0\u00a0\nyou see me pulling this eyeshadow palette a lot\u00a0\nin all my videos just because it's so good okay\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm gonna grab this palette i'm grabbing\u00a0\na big fluffy blending brush and i'm going to\u00a0\u00a0\ndip it into this matte lighter brown shade color\u00a0\nthis is going to be our base color i'm going to\u00a0\u00a0\nessentially just put this all over our eyelid in\u00a0\ncircular motions and it's totally okay if you get\u00a0\u00a0\nit in anywhere else really you can wipe it off\u00a0\nwhich is why we don't put our our foundation\u00a0\u00a0\non first so i'm lightly building this color\u00a0\ninto my eyelid i'm going in circular motions\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm bringing it a little bit towards the center\u00a0\nof my eyelid not all the way up to my brow bone\u00a0\u00a0\nbut definitely in the inner corner like this and\u00a0\nthen just blending everything out bring it in and\u00a0\u00a0\nbringing it out towards the outer v of my eye as\u00a0\nwell i'm gonna grab a smaller blending brush here\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm gonna go in with this darker brown shade just\u00a0\npicking up a little bit of that product i'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nfocus this on the outer v of my eye just right\u00a0\nhere and bring it into the crease right over there\u00a0\u00a0\nbut not all the way in just to the center\u00a0\nand that's going to add some definition to\u00a0\u00a0\nyour eyelid it's going to give you a crease look\u00a0\neffect and it's also going to darken the outer\u00a0\u00a0\narea which is going to give it a smoky look\u00a0\nwhich i really like let's do the same here\njust continuing to build this color here\nand then going in with that bigger blending\u00a0\nbrush and blending everything together\u00a0\u00a0\njust so it's nice and seamless and the product\u00a0\nwon't move so don't worry about it like\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing anywhere else or like not being there\u00a0\nanymore it won't move finally i'm gonna grab a\u00a0\u00a0\nsmaller blending brush again and this darker brown\u00a0\nshade color and i'm really just going to focus\u00a0\u00a0\nthis color again just on the outer v of my eye\u00a0\ni want to darken that area a little bit more so\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm just going to like i'm doing eyeliner but i'm\u00a0\nbringing it out and i'm going to kind of build it\u00a0\u00a0\ninto the crease very lightly like that just make\u00a0\na outer v shape and you can see the definition it\u00a0\u00a0\ngives to that eye it just makes it a little darker\u00a0\nit photographs a lot better and yeah we like it\nfinally with that bigger blending\u00a0\nbrushes blend it all out like that\nokay so the last step is grabbing just a\u00a0\nflat brush grabbing this matte it's like a\u00a0\u00a0\npeach color that's the darkest shade in here\u00a0\nand i'm going to put this just right here in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe center of my eyelid kind of that area that we\u00a0\ndidn't put any product just putting it right here\u00a0\u00a0\nand it's okay if it's not perfect we're going to\u00a0\nblend everything together but i'm just covering\u00a0\u00a0\nthe bases of everywhere that i didn't apply any\u00a0\neye shadow so right this inner corner and then\u00a0\u00a0\nright in the center i'm bringing it right\u00a0\nto where we created that outer v like this\nand then just building the color grabbing\u00a0\nthat bigger blending brush and just blending\u00a0\u00a0\neverything together so it's nice and seamless\u00a0\nand it should look like that the last step\u00a0\u00a0\nis to just darken it a little\u00a0\nbit more i'm grabbing this\u00a0\u00a0\ndark brown shade color again with a angled fluffy\u00a0\nbrush it's like a blending brush i'm just going\u00a0\u00a0\nto kind of draw a crease right here just to really\u00a0\ngive it some more dimension very lightly i'm using\u00a0\u00a0\na light hand with very minimal product just to\u00a0\nbuild it it's like those crease looks that you see\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know when people do it with concealer and\u00a0\nthen use the other side the blending side and just\u00a0\u00a0\nblend it um but a very natural technique it still\u00a0\ngives you like that cut vibe but it's not too like\u00a0\u00a0\nintense all right that's it that's it for the eye\u00a0\ncan you believe how easy it is i'm gonna go ahead\u00a0\u00a0\nand grab some mascara grab your favorite mascara\u00a0\nand i'm just gonna go ahead and coat my lashes\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can go ahead and use eyelashes if you like i'm\u00a0\nnot a fan of eyelashes um just because my lashes\u00a0\u00a0\nare pretty long i don't feel like i need them but\u00a0\nof course they look great so if you want to use\u00a0\u00a0\nsome eyelashes some strips if you have extensions\u00a0\nwhatever works for you okay so now that we have\u00a0\u00a0\nbasically our eyes almost done i'm gonna start\u00a0\nmy face and then i'll come back and finish up the\u00a0\u00a0\nlower lash line okay so now jumping into the base\u00a0\nof our face i'm gonna grab this primer this is by\u00a0\u00a0\ntoo faced it's the hangover x this is a classic\u00a0\none it's really really good just grabbing a few\u00a0\u00a0\npumps i have pores right in the center area of my\u00a0\nface right over there on my chin the bridge of my\u00a0\u00a0\nnose and then on the center of my forehead i'm\u00a0\nliterally just tapping the product into my skin\u00a0\u00a0\nyou don't need to put it everywhere you don't need\u00a0\nto use it like a moisturizer just put it in the\u00a0\u00a0\nareas where you need to prime for foundation today\u00a0\ni'm going in with the nars soft matte foundation\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm in the color valencia medium five this is a\u00a0\ngreat foundation it's one of my favorites it's\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit more high coverage and it's matte but\u00a0\nit doesn't make you feel cakey at all putting some\u00a0\u00a0\nof that product on a beauty blender and i'm going\u00a0\nto just blend this just blending this into my skin\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm not really putting it under my eye because\u00a0\ni'm going to put concealer on and i don't want\u00a0\u00a0\nto overlap it i'm putting the product all over\u00a0\nmy face in the areas that i won't be covering\u00a0\u00a0\nwith concealer or anything under my on my chin\u00a0\npushing my nail forehead and i don't put a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nof foundation on i go very lightly with it maybe\u00a0\none or two pumps this is a good amount of coverage\u00a0\u00a0\nfor me and because like i said i end up putting\u00a0\non more products on top i don't want to look\u00a0\u00a0\nlike i have everything on top of each other\u00a0\noverlapping and just like out of place\u00a0\u00a0\nwith instagram like photos and to really look\u00a0\nlike a bad boss chick you want to have a good\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlight and contour situation going on so we're\u00a0\ngonna go in heavy with all of that grabbing your\u00a0\u00a0\nfavorite concealer i can never use just one\u00a0\nconcealer especially for a brighter under eye i\u00a0\u00a0\nlike to mix i'm grabbing the anastasia concealer\u00a0\nthis is in the color number nine this is their\u00a0\u00a0\nmagic touch concealer and then the mac prep and\u00a0\nprime this is a prep and prime and light boost and\u00a0\u00a0\nit's a lot brighter so if you want that under eye\u00a0\nbrighter effect i really like this product it's\u00a0\u00a0\nsuper old but it's one of those og like must have\u00a0\ni'm putting this product right under my eye this\u00a0\u00a0\nis the anastasia one just a couple dots there\u00a0\nand then i'm going to grab the prep and prime\u00a0\u00a0\nand just put an additional few dots\u00a0\nyou can see how much brighter that is\u00a0\u00a0\nthe two mixed together make the perfect\u00a0\ncolor and then just put this on my forehead\u00a0\u00a0\ni also like to put it on my chin and the bridge\u00a0\nof my nose okay it looks super bright but i\u00a0\u00a0\npromise it'll look a lot better once i have\u00a0\neverything else on okay just blending this\u00a0\u00a0\nunder the eye really getting under\u00a0\nthat eye and then the trick is to\u00a0\u00a0\nliterally go up to your temple like\u00a0\nthat creating a cat eye lift effect\nand i'm bringing this all the way down to like\u00a0\nthe end of my nose area really blending that\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct in there it looks wild i know don't\u00a0\nfreak out i know what i'm doing i promise\nokay so now going back in with your\u00a0\nfoundation putting a small pump on there\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm gonna go back in the areas where i put\u00a0\nmy initial foundation and i'm gonna kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nblend that bottom area out like that just so\u00a0\nthat's there's no like lines or harsh lines\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm gonna kind of go over the chin area\u00a0\nhere i'm not touching the under eye but\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm just kind of going right here i'm also\u00a0\ngoing to blend my forehead out a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nnow grabbing any cream contour you have this\u00a0\nhas been

bringing\u00a0\nit all the way down just kind of on that if you\u00a0\u00a0\nlike this right over there that cheekbone and then\u00a0\nall over my forehead like that i'm gonna draw two\u00a0\u00a0\nlines down at the bridge of my low nose like that\u00a0\nand right on the tip as well and then on my chin\u00a0\u00a0\nand i like this product because it blends\u00a0\nreally nicely and that way it'll like\u00a0\u00a0\nmash well with everything else on your face\u00a0\nand you'll see i'm blending it out right here\u00a0\u00a0\non my chin i'm just going with a bigger blending\u00a0\nbrush this is like a duo fiber brush it's a mac\u00a0\u00a0\n130 really great brush and i'm going to bring this\u00a0\nblend this product all over my chin bring it down\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit and then in circular motions i'm\u00a0\ngonna blend this on my cheek like this i'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of bring it up in my forehead area blend that\u00a0\narea out bring it down to my temple same here and\u00a0\u00a0\nyou see how easy this product is to blend you want\u00a0\nto work with a cream contour that is very easy to\u00a0\u00a0\nblend and doesn't leave any harsh harsh lines look\u00a0\nhow good the forehead looks i love it now remember\u00a0\u00a0\nthis may easily be too much for a lot of people\u00a0\nand it is too much for me i don't wear this every\u00a0\u00a0\nday um at all actually it's a lot of product i'm\u00a0\nmore of a fan of lesser concealer but it's that\u00a0\u00a0\nvibe that makeup look that you see and all these\u00a0\nglam pictures that people have on instagram and\u00a0\u00a0\ntick tock like it really has to do with just\u00a0\na lot of effort with product and covering\u00a0\u00a0\neverything up now once again going in with that\u00a0\nbeauty blender no product on it but the foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nside i'm blending everything together there's no\u00a0\nsuch thing as over blending you want to blend as\u00a0\u00a0\nmuch as you can everything together i'm going to\u00a0\ngrab the anastasia beverly hills loose setting\u00a0\u00a0\npowder this is in the color banana and we're going\u00a0\nto bake because why not having my beauty

if it gets on your eyelashes happens to me\u00a0\u00a0\nall the time just wipe it off like that we're just\u00a0\nbaking the product and letting it sit there for a\u00a0\u00a0\nminute just because we put so much concealer\u00a0\non and i tend to get oily so i'm not gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nwant that this is a really amazing setting powder\u00a0\nit's also a banana undertone so it's not going\u00a0\u00a0\nto be super bright under my eye and i actually\u00a0\nwant to um like reduce the brightness a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit because that concealer was super bright as\u00a0\nyou can see so this combined with that will make\u00a0\u00a0\nthe perfect color i'm gonna put on my chin i'm\u00a0\nalso going to carve out that contour right here\nput this a little bit on my forehead and down

let's just say setting brush\u00a0\u00a0\nshould come off really easily like that and\u00a0\nyou should be nice and matte look at that wow\nand you see how the color just looks more natural\u00a0\nnow like it doesn't look terrifying in a way you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan keep your uh setting powder on the contour\u00a0\narea if you like i just kind of brush everything\u00a0\u00a0\noff but what this area

        "transcript_text": "Hi, this is MINSCO, LIPSCO.\nThe first LIPSCO of the year is the newly released\nPeripera Ink The Velvet Nude-Brew Collection.\nAs its name goes, it's all nude and moody colors.\nIt got so popular and sold out right away.\nI tried them on and the colors are amazing.\nSo pretty, I can't wait to show you.\nSo let's do a comparison in detail.\nFrom the texture to the detailed colors, let's go!\nThe legendary Peripera tints!\nInk The Velvet, it's their new five colors.\nIt's very different from the original Ink The Velvet colors, they're so moody.\nI was so excited, how is it on my lips?\nPretty, right?\nIt doesn't feel like a cheap tint of the price of 9,000 won.\nThe color's so luxurious.\nLike the department store lip product, right?\nThere are five colors,\nall soft and muted colors.\nThe Teteum collaboration Ink The Velvet that was out a bit ago,\nthose two colors were pretty grey\nbut these are less grey, and softer.\nIt's a more wearable nude color.\nSame with Teteum colors,\nbut it's more white on the lips than on my arm.\nIt looks like the milky nude colors.\nThe swatches aren't the same as the actual color on your lips.\nYou must all know the texture of this Ink The Velvet since it's so famous,\nit's the creamy velvet tint.\nThe thick and creamy feel\nwraps around the lips, keeping it moist, with its matte velvet texture.\nThere have been so many lip products at Peripera\nand the most popular one is the 'Ink The~' line.\nInk The Velvet, Ink The Airy Velvet,\nand their newly released ones have the name 'Ink Mood~'\nInk Mood Matte Tint, Ink Mood Drop Tint,\nand Ink Mood Matte Lipstick.\nThis Ink Mood line goes along with the COVID life,\nthe texture being thinner and more fitting.\nThe Ink Mood Matte Tint that I reviewed last year\nhas that thin and fitting matte texture for that face mask life.\nIt doesn't get stained, it has the absorbing-in application.\nComparing it to Ink Mood Matte Tint,\nInk The Velvet is much thicker and creamier\nso you may think it's only doing it on the surface.\nBut with the creamy velvet texture\nit's much less dry, with a thicker color.\nIt really covers up that lip color.\nIt's not about which tint is good and which is bad,\nit may vary with preferences.\nHowever, since Ink The Velvet is thicker\nit does get stains.\nI recommend you finish it off with an mm-ah on a piece of tissue.\nInk The Velvet is a famous line for its staining ability,\nbut perhaps with the nude color, it's doesn't stain too much.\nThe stain color isn't too nude, it's pretty vivid.\nStill, since the color's so thick\nthe stain color has not as much effect.\nAll the matte tints nowadays\nhave the thin and fitting texture, right?\nSo a thick texture like Ink The Velvet\nfelt like something new.\nThis product leaves a bit of a glow.\nSo if you want less of that glow\nuse your fingers and it gets more blurry.\nPlus it can reduce some of the extra product\nso I recommend you use your fingertip to blend it out.\nFinally the fragrance, the same as that of the original Ink The Velvet.\nSome sheer flowery smell.\nMany people have used this Ink The Velvet\nso I'm sure it's something familiar.\nSo let me use these moody colors on my lips\nand compare the similar colors as well.\nLet's go again!\nFirst up, no.24 Milky Nude.\nIt's the nude beige, but not too yellow; an earl-grey beige.\nIt's like Mac Date Maker and Mull It Over mixed together.\nComparing it to other base lips I've been using\nit's less yellow, greyer.\nWith a lot of white, it's a very soft beige.\nIt's white but not neon-like\nso it's a nice moody touch.\nIt's a warm base with not much yellowness compared to the other base lips\nso if you like a thick texture\nI recommend you take one as a base lip.\nThis color's amazing with covering up that purple on your lips.\nMixing it with no.2 Cinnamon Nude for that soft autumn warm feel, amazing as well.\nI mixed it with n.28 Mauveful Nude\nfor that warm-and-cool mysterious muted lip color, it was pretty too.\nNo.25 Cinnamon Nude is a muted rose brown color.\nLooking at its swatch, it had that luxurious color\nlike that of Hera Rosy Suede.\nThis line of products gets murkier in color on the lips.\nIt gets softer and nuder than the swatch color.\nSo it has this rose milk tea color\nwith a drop of milk.\nIt's like a warm cup of earl-grey milk tea with some rose color, right?\nIf you're a warm tone and you're looking for one single color\nI recommend you with this no.25.\nIt's muted, so it gets you that mood\nyet it's not too deep.\nNo.26 Well-made Nude is\npinker than no.24 with its nude rose color.\nIt's like getting yellow out and rose in for Etude Midnight Mauve,\nit's a cooler rose beige tone than no.24.\nIt's a nice base lip too.\nThis color has that nice mixture of white and grey\nwith that nice murky color.\nIt also has that lukewarm mauve with milk,\nanother pretty color it was.\nNo.27 Strawberry Nude\nis more pink mauve than no.26.\nIt's something that I'd get mixing mauve colors\nwith YSL Nude Emblem.\nYou do see more whiteness on the lips, right?\nThis color's like white-like grey with pink.\nIt's a light pink, but not too saturated\nso the color itself isn't too vivid.\nIt's light yet sheer, so I think it's a good\nmoody choice for the summer cool lights.\nFinally no.28 Mauveful Nude.\nIt's a very muted grayish mauve.\nIt's more milk added to Mac More The Mehr-ier.\nThis color's much softer and nicer when applied in a thin layer.\nI don't think it will look great on many\nif you're not a complete mute tone,\nbut it's a very nice color that makes you enjoy\nthe 'unique and moody me' vibe.\nWith more layers, it gets more toned down, so it gets more unique.\nI really personally loved the Mac More The Mehr-ier.\nIt's not the replica, but the mood is very similar\nso I loved it so much.\nThat was my take on\nPeripera's new Ink The Velvet Nude-Brew Collection.\nHow was it?\nI thought they were so luxurious in color.\nI love what I'm wearing right now as well.\nIt's all the trendy colors of the era.\nBut, if you liked that vivid color of Peripera, this will be a letdown for you.\nIt's something that their line didn't have before\nso I loved it.\nThank you for finishing this video today.\nHave a happy rest of the day and cheer up tomorrow!\nBye!",

mascara recently and i've been loving it\u00a0\u00a0\nespecially as like a pre-individual lash mascara\u00a0\nand the reason why is because it's not a super\u00a0\u00a0\nmessy formula and that's really something that i\u00a0\nsuggest you take into consideration when you're\u00a0\u00a0\napplying a mascara before you do your individuals\u00a0\nwhich is what i recommend you don't want anything\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's too dramatic or too messy or too liquidy\u00a0\nbecause you don't want to start out with lashes\u00a0\u00a0\nthat are coated with a mascara that looks clumpy\u00a0\nor just too intense you want to have like a nice\u00a0\u00a0\nfine layer just to kind of have your lashes sit on\u00a0\ntop of them if that makes sense you'll see what i\u00a0\u00a0\nmean in a second so i'm going to do one coat to\u00a0\nstart on each of my eyes so a technique that i\u00a0\u00a0\nthink is really important and really helpful is\u00a0\nwhen you're applying your first coat of mascara\u00a0\u00a0\nyou really want to get that wand into your root\u00a0\nand you want to make sure you saturate the root of\u00a0\u00a0\nyour lashes and then you pull it directly up for\u00a0\na little bit of a lift and curl and the reason why\u00a0\u00a0\nyou want to get to that root is because it's going\u00a0\nto make your natural lash line appear much fuller\u00a0\u00a0\nso when you're going in with your individuals\u00a0\nit's just going to blend so much better and it's\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to make you look like you have more lashes\u00a0\neven without the individual so it's just a really\u00a0\u00a0\ngood tip when you're applying your mascara get to\u00a0\nthe root wiggle it and then pull it straight up\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so mascara is done you'll notice i\u00a0\njust did one coat on each side because\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's really all i need i don't want\u00a0\nto clump them up or go too dramatic\u00a0\u00a0\nlike i mentioned before i do my individuals so\u00a0\none coat is fine i'm gonna move on now so i want\u00a0\u00a0\nto show you a couple of my favorite brands that i\u00a0\nuse both professionally and on myself on the rare\u00a0\u00a0\noccasions that i put individual lashes on myself\u00a0\none of them being elegant lashes this is more of\u00a0\u00a0\na professional brand you can find them at beauty\u00a0\nsupplies you can also find them easily online\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich is great so i'll make sure i link them\u00a0\nin the description box but these are just great\u00a0\u00a0\nmore wispy just very soft individual lashes very\u00a0\nstraightforward so i'll be mixing short and medium\u00a0\u00a0\nin length another brand that i talk about all\u00a0\nthe time my channel and i use them all the time\u00a0\u00a0\nis monda studio they're a professional brand\u00a0\nthey sell them at a couple beauty supply stores\u00a0\u00a0\nin los angeles i believe they're online\u00a0\ni just haven't been able to find a link\u00a0\u00a0\nvery easily but i'll try again these are great\u00a0\nindividual lashes another great option that is\u00a0\u00a0\nreally easy to find are the ardell individuals\u00a0\nthey sell them everywhere so now let's talk about\u00a0\u00a0\nglue i have a favorite glue that i just\u00a0\ncan't live without it doesn't have to be\u00a0\u00a0\nthis particular brand but this one is from duo\u00a0\nit's more of like a a brush on formula which i\u00a0\u00a0\nthink is super easy now i don't actually use the\u00a0\nbrush what i do is i open it up and then i just\u00a0\u00a0\neither scoop some out on the top of my hand or on\u00a0\ntop of a painters palette or you can actually take\u00a0\u00a0\nyour individual lashes and just dip it directly\u00a0\nonto the brush and then apply them so the reason\u00a0\u00a0\nwhy i choose a formula like this one is it's more\u00a0\nof a tacky formula so it allows me to just dip my\u00a0\u00a0\nlashes into the glue and then directly apply it\u00a0\nwhereas if i'm using more of a traditional more of\u00a0\u00a0\na liquid formula like this old school duo there's\u00a0\nmore of a drying time in between which i just\u00a0\u00a0\ni'd rather skip that and also this has extremely\u00a0\ngreat hold so if you want your lashes to stay on\u00a0\u00a0\nthrough a windy day or even like jumping in the\u00a0\npool honestly this will stay on whereas this one\u00a0\u00a0\nnot so much the next tool that i recommend\u00a0\nyou have on hand is a good pair of tweezers\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one is from mac i've loved these tweezers\u00a0\nfor so long since i was a mackerel there's just\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething about them they have such great grip\u00a0\nthey're not super pointy and they're really not\u00a0\u00a0\nsuper sharp which is good like you don't want to\u00a0\nstab your eyes when you're using tweezers anyway\u00a0\u00a0\ntaking my favorite tweezers from mac and\u00a0\nmy lash glue i'm gonna open up my lash glue\u00a0\u00a0\nmake sure i have a good amount on the wand what's\u00a0\ngreat about this one in particular not all of\u00a0\u00a0\nthem have like not all these formulas have a\u00a0\nbrush like this this isn't even a brush it's\u00a0\u00a0\nalmost like a little like shelf so if you lay it\u00a0\nflat there's a whole bunch of blue right there\u00a0\u00a0\njust waiting to have some individuals placed\u00a0\non it so i'm just going to take a couple of my\u00a0\u00a0\nshort length ones and just pop them on the side of\u00a0\nmy hand so they're nice and ready to go when i am\nso i'm just gonna pop a couple\u00a0\nof these on my hand to start\u00a0\u00a0\nand here's where it's gonna get tricky\u00a0\nto show on camera because i need to hold\u00a0\u00a0\nand do a couple of different things all at the\u00a0\nsame time i'll be holding my glue and a mirror all\u00a0\u00a0\nwhile keeping some lashes on the top of my hand so\u00a0\ntake my tweezers i'm going to grab one at a time\u00a0\u00a0\ndip it into my glue and like i mentioned earlier\u00a0\nthere's no drying down time with this glue i can\u00a0\u00a0\ngo straight from the glue to my lashes and it'll\u00a0\nstick which is key so i'll be starting with the\u00a0\u00a0\nshort length and then going in with the medium\u00a0\nwhere i want more length and a little more drama\nmoving on to the medium length\u00a0\ni'll only be placing a couple of\u00a0\u00a0\nthese where i want a little more\u00a0\nlength and a little more volume\nanother good tip that i think is more\u00a0\nflattering is not going super long\u00a0\u00a0\nin length on the very end of your lashes if you\u00a0\ngo super long or even just just long enough it\u00a0\u00a0\ncould actually create a shadow and bring\u00a0\ndown the corner of your eye which is again\u00a0\u00a0\nthe opposite of what you're trying to do you're\u00a0\nyou're trying to open up your eyes you're trying\u00a0\u00a0\nto get them to lift up and so if you go too long\u00a0\nor too dramatic on the outer corner of your eye\u00a0\u00a0\nit can create a shadow and just really\u00a0\nbring down the appearance of your eye so\u00a0\u00a0\nstick to shorter length it's going\u00a0\nto be a little more flattering\nso i'm finished with the medium length i only\u00a0\ndid three of them and i really focused them\u00a0\u00a0\npretty much going straight up towards my brow\u00a0\nbone and that again is just going to give me a\u00a0\u00a0\nreally pretty open eyed effect so before i move\u00a0\non to my next eye i'm going to take a step back\u00a0\u00a0\nand i'm going to look in my mirror and this\u00a0\nis where i'm going to evaluate and just kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof reassess and make sure that i'm happy with\u00a0\nthe length the thickness the fullness and so\u00a0\u00a0\nfor me i'm looking at my lashes and i could\u00a0\nuse a little more just right here and then just\u00a0\u00a0\nright at the very end so i'm going\u00a0\nto add just two more short length\nso now that my individual lashes are applied\u00a0\nto this eye i'm going to go in and this is\u00a0\u00a0\nanother one of my favorite tips when you're\u00a0\napplying individual lashes or even strip lashes\u00a0\u00a0\nand that is to go in and tight line\u00a0\nyour top lash line i'll be using a black\u00a0\u00a0\npencil from makeup forever you could also\u00a0\nof course use a really dark brown as well\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one's just going to show up a little more on\u00a0\ncamera so you'll really get to see the difference\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'll be taking this and tucking\u00a0\nit straight into my top lash line and\u00a0\u00a0\nreally wiggling it in between my lashes\u00a0\nto just get a nice even layer throughout\u00a0\u00a0\nso once i get that initial line all the way\u00a0\nacross my top lash line i'm going to go in\u00a0\u00a0\nand i'm going to kind of wiggle my\u00a0\npencil in between where i see any gaps of\u00a0\u00a0\nskin where i don't have the lashes\u00a0\nconnecting to my lashes this is just\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to help to blend them so they're more\u00a0\nseamless and you can really not detect them\nanother great technique to blend your individual\u00a0\nlashes or even your strip lashes is to take\u00a0\u00a0\neither a dark brown shadow or a black shadow\u00a0\nand a small flat angle brush and what you're\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to do is just very lightly line the\u00a0\ntop where they are and then that's just\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to help to blend them so they're nice\u00a0\nand seamless so let me show you that so for\u00a0\u00a0\nthis any dark brown eyeshadow will do i'm just\u00a0\ngrabbing one from one of my favorite palettes\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one's kind of old school it's from mac\u00a0\nit's the semi-sweet times nine palette and\u00a0\u00a0\nagain you could use any dark brown or even\u00a0\na black eyeshadow that you have on hand\u00a0\u00a0\nand i'll be using just a flat angled brush this\u00a0\none is from zoeva it's a 322 brow liner brush so\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm using a really flat thin brush because i'm not\u00a0\ntrying to create like a an actual liner i'm really\u00a0\u00a0\njust trying to tuck this into my lash line just\u00a0\nto blend that lash line even more and you can see\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm not dragging it along my lash line i'm really\u00a0\ngetting in there and i'm stamping it into my lash\u00a0\u00a0\nline instead and with this it's important not to\u00a0\njust take it and drag it across your lash line\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm really just taking that and i'm pressing\u00a0\nit and stamping it into my lash line to blend\u00a0\u00a0\nlast but not least i'll be going with one more\u00a0\ncoat of mascara and what this is going to do is\u00a0\u00a0\nreally make sure that my lashes are blended into\u00a0\nthe false lashes so that way they're nice and\u00a0\u00a0\nseamless i'll also be applying this to my bottom\u00a0\nlashes as well just to really tie the look in\u00a0\u00a0\ntogether i think it looks kind of disjointed if\u00a0\nyou just have like full set of lashes on the top\u00a0\u00a0\nand then nothing on the bottom so take the time\u00a0\nand apply some bottom mascara and it really ties\u00a0\u00a0\nthe look together and also it makes your eyes\u00a0\nlook even bigger using the same technique as\u00a0\u00a0\ni did with my first coat of mascara i'm going to\u00a0\ntake the wand i'm going to get it to the root of\u00a0\u00a0\nmy lashes and i'm going to wiggle it straight\u00a0\nthis time into my false lashes to blend them\nand since i don't have individual\u00a0\nlashes towards the inner part of\u00a0\u00a0\nmy eye i'm going to make sure that these\u00a0\nlittle lashes are not left out and they're\u00a0\u00a0\nthoroughly coated with mascara to help\u00a0\nblend them into the rest of my lashes\nokay so this side of my eye is complete my lashes\u00a0\nare on my mascara is on and you'll notice too\u00a0\u00a0\nthey have a really nice curl to them and that's\u00a0\nbecause if you utilize that technique i showed\u00a0\u00a0\nearlier with taking your mascara wand really\u00a0\ngetting to the root of your lashes wiggling it\u00a0\u00a0\nback and forth and then pulling it straight up it\u00a0\ngives you such an amazing lift and curl without\u00a0\u00a0\nhaving to go in with an actual lash curler but\u00a0\nif that's not holding your lashes up on their own\u00a0\u00a0\nsome people have straighter lashes\u00a0\nthat want to just kind of go down\u00a0\u00a0\ni suggest getting a half lash\u00a0\ncurler this will make your life\u00a0\u00a0\nso much easier if you're trying to curl your\u00a0\nlashes when you have individuals or a strip\u00a0\u00a0\non it's completely open-ended so it really\u00a0\nallows you to just get in there and place it\u00a0\u00a0\nwhere you need it so now the side is complete\u00a0\ni'm going to finish this eye off camera and\u00a0\u00a0\ni'll be right back so here's the finished look i\u00a0\nhave individuals on both sides now i really want\u00a0\u00a0\nto film this video for you guys just to share\u00a0\nmy tried and true tricks and techniques on how\u00a0\u00a0\nto apply individual lashes these are techniques\u00a0\ni've picked up along the years of doing makeup on\u00a0\u00a0\nclients and on myself and i really find these tips\u00a0\nand techniques to be super helpful when you're\u00a0\u00a0\napplying individuals because we all know they can\u00a0\nbe pretty frustrating to do on yourself especially\u00a0\u00a0\nleave me a comment below if you have any other\u00a0\nquestions on how i apply these lashes don't\u00a0\u00a0\nforget to follow me on instagram i'm at makeup\u00a0\nby nicki larose and i'll see you guys soon bye",

I really need to practice doing this, it makes such a difference. I\u2019m a little concerned about being sensitive to the adhesive in the glue. How do you remove them and can they be reused?",

here\u00a0\u00a0\nbefore if this is the first video here hello\u00a0\nmy name is andy such a lover of beauty i love\u00a0\u00a0\neverything beauty makeup related so if you want\u00a0\nto see some more makeup content on your timeline\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely don't forget to subscribe\u00a0\nbecause i upload quite a lot of videos\ni actually just got back home because i've\u00a0\nbeen out a little bit of a brunch which was\u00a0\u00a0\na delightful and i came back and this one had been\u00a0\ndelivered to my door this is the new wild greens\u00a0\u00a0\npalette urban decay you open it like this and it\u00a0\nis like a half neutral half green palette here\u00a0\u00a0\ni've already swatched it so you can see what\u00a0\nit looks like right here i bought this palette\u00a0\u00a0\non the urban decay website for 44 yesterday i\u00a0\nactually did end up paying for next day delivery\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause i was just so intrigued and i wanted\u00a0\nto try it out and see what this was all about\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause i feel like when you're\u00a0\nnaming a palette wild greens\u00a0\u00a0\nit's like i have questions like i want to see how\u00a0\nwild is it really i know some people say that they\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't like the packaging i love the packaging this\u00a0\ncolor is actually really nice this is extremely\u00a0\u00a0\nslim and nice but still feels very sturdy\u00a0\nthis packaging opens up really really cute and\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can put this you can flip it over\u00a0\non the other side very easily without\u00a0\u00a0\nbreaking the palette so it's actually like\u00a0\nreally slim and nice and i have to say\u00a0\u00a0\ni enjoy this packaging a lot i think this is\u00a0\nreally nice slim nice still sturdy i milli percent\u00a0\u00a0\napprove of this packaging i was wearing another\u00a0\nmakeup look today that makeup look is coming on\u00a0\u00a0\nmonday but i took it off because i want to try\u00a0\nthis one okay i will link down below where you'll\u00a0\u00a0\nbe able to get this one i know this is launching\u00a0\non at least ulta and probably sephora as well and\u00a0\u00a0\ni will leave some links down below in case you're\u00a0\ninterested in knowing where to find this one but\u00a0\u00a0\nlet's zoom in so that we can try this one out\u00a0\nis this a really wild greens this is a little\u00a0\u00a0\nmetallic so i'll try to not blind you i want to\u00a0\nstart with this one and i want to see what kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof definition we can get in the crease with this\u00a0\none it's called kale so i'm gonna start with that\u00a0\u00a0\none in the crease and just see how that one looks\u00a0\non its own it is like a pretty not like super deep\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i would say that it's not really light\u00a0\neither i mean there's definitely a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nof definition to this one and i feel like a lot of\u00a0\npeople for a lot of people this will be like green\u00a0\u00a0\nenough i really do think so and i will say i have\u00a0\nbeen more impressed with the mats from urban decay\u00a0\u00a0\nthan i have with been with can i speak than i have\u00a0\nbeen with the shimmers and i've already swatched\u00a0\u00a0\nthis as i'm filming this normally i will do the\u00a0\nfirst impression and i'll swatch it afterwards but\u00a0\u00a0\ni was just too intrigued and i wanted to\u00a0\nswatch it and i think the shimmer swatched\u00a0\u00a0\na lot better in this one than some of the other\u00a0\npalettes from urban decay that i've been trying\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know i've not been like the biggest fan of\u00a0\nthe ultraviolet or the what's its face cyber i\u00a0\u00a0\ndidn't think that they were like super impressive\u00a0\nand i will say just swatches i already feel like\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is better and i really like the packaging\u00a0\ni know some people are dogging on the packaging\u00a0\u00a0\nlike online but i don't hate it that is pretty is\u00a0\nit super dark no would i prefer something darker\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely but i still like it i still like it i'm\u00a0\njust packing it all and blending the edges there\u00a0\u00a0\nis a lighter green called super greens and i feel\u00a0\nlike we're gonna try a little bit of that on top\u00a0\u00a0\nto blend just to see what kind of a tone\u00a0\nthat one has it is like more of a like a mint\u00a0\u00a0\nor like a pastel and i feel like that one oop\u00a0\nwould probably be a really pretty lid or in the\u00a0\u00a0\ncorner shade as well just because i really like\u00a0\nit all matte look and i i like that they gave us\u00a0\u00a0\nuh more than one matte green although i will say\u00a0\npersonally i would have preferred if there was a\u00a0\u00a0\nmatte in here that was like super dark as well\u00a0\nbecause i don't feel like any of these mats are\u00a0\u00a0\nlike super dark they're just like light and\u00a0\nmid tone and i feel like that is usually a\u00a0\u00a0\nproblem just with my makeup preferences\u00a0\nand urban decay that they never really\u00a0\u00a0\ngive you something that's like a really\u00a0\ndeep matte and i don't really know why\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe it's like not as universally loved with a\u00a0\ndark matter in the outer corner as i just think it\u00a0\u00a0\nis but it's just something that i really love i'm\u00a0\ntaking that shade super green on a really light\u00a0\u00a0\nfluffy brush and i'm just going to fluff that\u00a0\non the edge and i will go in again with the\u00a0\u00a0\ngreen afterwards and blend over the\u00a0\nedge i just want to have something\u00a0\u00a0\nto fluff it over the edge i think that it's a\u00a0\nlittle bit weird that this green is this like\u00a0\u00a0\ngrungy green and then we have this one that's more\u00a0\nlike a minty cool tone one i don't feel like they\u00a0\u00a0\nnecessarily super mix together i kind of think\u00a0\nthat this one should maybe have been more of a\u00a0\u00a0\nyellowy toned light one or like\u00a0\nmaybe there should have been like a\u00a0\u00a0\nyellowy green in here i feel like that\u00a0\nwould have gone better together if you\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't necessarily know if i think that these like\u00a0\ngo together if i'm if i'm gonna be totally honest\u00a0\u00a0\ni don't think the tone goes together but maybe\u00a0\nthey're not meant to be used together but i think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat if there's two matte greens in the palette\u00a0\nthey should go together but maybe that's just\u00a0\u00a0\nme i mean i do like how this looks i think it\u00a0\nlooks really really pretty i just like something\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's a little bit more dramatic so i'm actually\u00a0\ngonna try this one it's called stash which is this\u00a0\u00a0\nvery dark pretty like mossy green out here\u00a0\nand i'm gonna put that on the flat brush like\u00a0\u00a0\nlike this and i'm gonna spray that and i'm gonna\u00a0\nput that out here on the outer part of the lid\u00a0\u00a0\nand we can like at least get some like\u00a0\ndarkness out here in the outer part of the lid\nyeah i really like that i think that that\u00a0\nlooks really cute so i'm gonna put this on\u00a0\u00a0\nhalf the lid and in the outer part of the\u00a0\nlid and if you use i have something here\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me clean this off on my pants like a boss\u00a0\ni'm gonna use this one that's like a little\u00a0\u00a0\ndome brush and i'm putting some on the dome\u00a0\nbrush and this is dry and i'm just buffing\u00a0\u00a0\nthis out here in the outer corner listen\u00a0\nyou can use a shimmer in your outer corner\u00a0\u00a0\nbut remember that when you start manipulating a\u00a0\nlike metallic like this you usually get a little\u00a0\u00a0\nfallout just heads up heads up but i'm just\u00a0\nputting a little bit like that and i will just\nblend over it i feel like that looks really good\u00a0\nso remember you can always use a metallic like\u00a0\u00a0\nthat as well doesn't that look pretty good i think\u00a0\nthat that looks really nice what am i gonna do on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe am i gonna do this one that's like a i don't\u00a0\nthink i'm gonna do this minty one i feel like\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one two together would be really nice like\u00a0\nethereal looks i think i'm gonna use this one\u00a0\u00a0\nthat is called twist i had to look and i did spray\u00a0\nthis one as well because i spray like i pick up\u00a0\u00a0\nwith my brush and then i spray the brush with\u00a0\nany any kind of setting spray or even water to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe honest it's just something to keep the shadow\u00a0\ntogether while you're applying it on the lid\u00a0\u00a0\nso you don't get a lot of fallout and you get\u00a0\nthe shadow to be as opaque as possible it's\u00a0\u00a0\njust something that i prefer well this turned\u00a0\nout to be a really really cute look i think i'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to use some of the neutrals on the lower\u00a0\nlash line so that we can try as many shadows as\u00a0\u00a0\npossible i really liked when i swatched this one\u00a0\nthat's called fuss i think you can even see that\u00a0\u00a0\nit has like a orangey base and like a lime green\u00a0\nshift it has a really really nice sparkle to it\u00a0\u00a0\ni kind of want to use that on my lower lash line\u00a0\ni am almost a little bit shocked that i'm really\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm liking this i mean this is cute like would\u00a0\ni like go recommend like is this my new favorite\u00a0\u00a0\ngreen palette not really okay i'm using the\u00a0\nshade turmeric which is this like clay color here\u00a0\u00a0\nlike is this my new like favorite green palette\u00a0\nno is it my favorite urban decay palette maybe\u00a0\u00a0\ni don't hate it especially if you're\u00a0\nthe kind of person that's like\u00a0\u00a0\nyou want to try a little green but you maybe\u00a0\nyou don't want to like commit i don't think\u00a0\u00a0\nit's an awful decision especially if you're\u00a0\nthe kind of person that wants to go in store\u00a0\u00a0\nand buy makeup like here's the thing if you want\u00a0\nto like what is the best green palette out there\u00a0\u00a0\nwould i recommend this one i don't know this\u00a0\nis this is the shade fuss the one that i said\u00a0\u00a0\nwas like a orange with like a lime green\u00a0\nshift i want to use a little bit like here\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah that's do you see that there's a\u00a0\nlittle of a green shift i think that is a\u00a0\u00a0\nreally pretty color reminds me a little bit of\u00a0\nthat like natasha the nona shade that had like a\u00a0\u00a0\norangey base and the lime green shift that\u00a0\nshadow is really i'm just saying like if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou're normally into neutrals you want to\u00a0\ntry a little green you don't like ordering\u00a0\u00a0\nonline like you want to go in store or you\u00a0\nwant to buy from a brand that you know i\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't think that this is a horrible palette i\u00a0\nlike this a lot more than i like the urban decay\u00a0\u00a0\nultraviolet and i like it a lot more than i like\u00a0\nthe cyber i honestly think it's fairly cute i mean\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm i listen i'm surprising myself\u00a0\ni'm gonna use kickback which is that\u00a0\u00a0\ndark brown and i'm just gonna see if i'm\u00a0\neven able to like deepen this up a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah that turned a little bit darker i'm still\u00a0\nmissing something that's like you know dark\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i realized that like every time i say that\u00a0\nwhen i'm like oh i wish there was something dark\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's always like a couple of comments of\u00a0\npeople like i don't use dark eyeshadows so\u00a0\u00a0\nif you're the kind of person that doesn't use dark\u00a0\neyeshadows you're the kind of person that just\u00a0\u00a0\nwants something maybe a bit easier maybe a little\u00a0\nbit like not every day but like on that path i'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna use the one that's in the beginning here\u00a0\nthat it's chill it's basically just a shimmery\u00a0\u00a0\nshimmery beige so that is the finished look and\u00a0\ni will say doesn't this look nice i do like it\u00a0\u00a0\ni like it a lot i think this is a really nice i\u00a0\nthink it's a really nice palette and a really nice\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor scheme i really really love the packaging\u00a0\neven though i will say that these pieces like\u00a0\u00a0\nyou have to push them into fit but on the other\u00a0\nhand it makes it a really snug closure without any\u00a0\u00a0\nmagnets i like it what am i gonna say do i love it\u00a0\ni don't know about that i love the look but like\u00a0\u00a0\ni don't know what to say like sometimes i feel\u00a0\nlike i get so disappointed with urban decay but\u00a0\u00a0\nin this regards i kind of think that they i think\u00a0\nthey did something good i mean the colors are nice\u00a0\u00a0\nthe formulas are nice you are able to create a\u00a0\nlook you can use this like dark color at the end\u00a0\u00a0\nto get some depth if you want to would i have\u00a0\npreferred something more dramatic in this sure\u00a0\u00a0\ndo i prefer when the greens are like super\u00a0\npoppy yeah but that's like my taste as well\u00a0\u00a0\ni mean and calling it wild greens are the\u00a0\ngreens wild maybe not but it's maybe more\u00a0\u00a0\nin the you know wild and free the wild nature\u00a0\ni think maybe it's more in that regards because\u00a0\u00a0\nlike you have the the snakes and the branches\u00a0\nand stuff like that so i think it's more like\u00a0\u00a0\nnature themed than it is\u00a0\nlike wild and crazy themed so\u00a0\u00a0\nall in all i don't hate it if you like super\u00a0\ncolorful green looks maybe this isn't for you\u00a0\u00a0\nif you like more neutral looks or more toned\u00a0\ndown looks but you would like to try some greens\u00a0\u00a0\nespecially if you're the kind of person that want\u00a0\nto buy from well established brands or if you're a\u00a0\u00a0\nbig fan of urban decay and you want to know\u00a0\nif this is nice or not or if your kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nperson want to buy things in store i kind\u00a0\nof think it's good i know i'm shocked too\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm shocked too anyways that was this with this\u00a0\nvideo this was a little bit of a bonus video i\u00a0\u00a0\nhope you enjoyed it don't forget to subscribe\u00a0\nthough because i will have more videos there's\u00a0\u00a0\nalways a lot of videos coming on my channel i\u00a0\nwould love to see you in my next one too bye\nyou",

I love mossy greens and have been WAITING for this review. I kinda dig this color story and it beats the Armani quad I;ve been using for this vibe.  Cannot wait!",

I love dark colors and you love dark colors, but the average consumer of Urban Decay doesn\u2019t know what to do with tones like that. I talk to clients daily that get intimidated by the black in the ABH Soft Glam palette and will not buy it because of that. Since people are looking for greens, I agree that this is a nice \u201csafe\u201d solution for them. I think I\u2019ve fallen out of love with Urban so I\u2019m passing. But this does make me want to bust out my Wilderness palette and play again with that!",

any of these yet i\u00a0\nreally wanted to give you guys my real reaction\u00a0\u00a0\nto everything so yeah let's get started okay so\u00a0\ni want to start off with the hair care because i\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely need some new hair care products if you\u00a0\nguys are new to my channel you probably don't know\u00a0\u00a0\nthat i've been on sparrow lactone for my skin for\u00a0\nabout a few months i actually wean myself off of\u00a0\u00a0\nit so i'm not taking it currently but it did make\u00a0\nmy hair fall out so i feel like any type of hair\u00a0\u00a0\ncare right now will really help save my hair even\u00a0\nthough it's still pretty long and pretty thick\u00a0\u00a0\ni do want to always make sure i'm using the best\u00a0\nproducts for my hair so this is the for hers\u00a0\u00a0\nshampoo and conditioner this is the triple threat\u00a0\nso it looks like this is to help thicken your hair\u00a0\u00a0\nand get you more fuller looking hair also a\u00a0\ncleaner scalp which is definitely what i need so\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shampoo is really to get your hair fuller and\u00a0\ncleanse up any buildup and strengthen your hair\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is also made with pumpkin seed oil and it's\u00a0\nformulated to cleanse the scalp without weighing\u00a0\u00a0\nyour hair down and it also thickens your hair so\u00a0\nyour hair will appear thicker and fuller and then\u00a0\u00a0\nthe conditioner is actually um to help thicken\u00a0\nhydrate and amplify the shine which i love i\u00a0\u00a0\nalways love that this is actually formulated with\u00a0\na three-part blend of argan coconut and sunflower\u00a0\u00a0\nseed oils this conditioner is a luxurious\u00a0\nbath of hydration which your girl needs that\nso it smells like roses but it's a very fresh\u00a0\nscent so it's gonna smell very very clean on\u00a0\u00a0\nyour hair i'm really excited to see how this\u00a0\nworks on me but yes so these are the shampoo\u00a0\u00a0\nand conditioner so they also sent me some biotin\u00a0\ngummies i actually haven't took biotin in a while\u00a0\u00a0\nso i feel like this is the perfect time to try\u00a0\nit out it says this is a holistic supplement\u00a0\u00a0\nformulated with essential vitamins enriched with\u00a0\nbiotin and folic acid i always think that biotin\u00a0\u00a0\nis so good to take on a regular basis no matter\u00a0\nwhat so i'm definitely happy that they gave me\u00a0\u00a0\nthese this is in a wild cherry flavor and\u00a0\ni'm gonna try it out for you guys right now\u00a0\u00a0\nand i feel like gummies are just so much better\u00a0\nthan the pills they're just easier and i feel\u00a0\u00a0\nlike i'm more consistent in taking it when they\u00a0\ntaste like candy so just little gummy bears\nthese taste like candy you guys they have like\u00a0\na little layer of sugar it seems like and they\u00a0\u00a0\njust so good definitely cherry flavor if you\u00a0\nguys like cherry okay so they actually sent me\u00a0\u00a0\na hair regrowth treatment which it's ironic\u00a0\nbecause i definitely need that right now\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is dermatologist recommended number one\u00a0\nactive ingredient reactivates hair follicles\u00a0\u00a0\nto stimulate growth and it's proven to help\u00a0\nyour hair regrow it's also unscented so it's\u00a0\u00a0\nprobably good for your sensitive skin in case\u00a0\nif you have that yeah i'm very excited to try\u00a0\u00a0\nthis as well because i never ever tried a\u00a0\nhair regrowth treatment ever before because\u00a0\u00a0\nmy hair normally just grows like crazy and\u00a0\nit's always so long so i never really had a\u00a0\u00a0\nproblem with regrowing my hair until now\u00a0\nso i'm very excited to give this a try\u00a0\u00a0\nand then they also gave me this whole entire\u00a0\nkit so you guys can actually try everything that\u00a0\u00a0\ni just mentioned just now all in one kit and i\u00a0\nlove that just in case you guys don't want to buy\u00a0\u00a0\neach product separately you can get everything\u00a0\nyou need all in one kit to help your hair grow\u00a0\u00a0\nor make it thicker fuller shinier all that is all\u00a0\nhere for you guys so i love that they showed that\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can get it all in one as well so for the next\u00a0\nhaircare product they actually sent me a detox\u00a0\u00a0\nscalp scrub so this has salicylic acid and aloe\u00a0\nextract i really love the packaging of this you\u00a0\u00a0\nguys i do have a really dry scalp i suffer from\u00a0\npsoriasis too time and time again every time i get\u00a0\u00a0\nstressed out it tends to act up so i definitely\u00a0\nlove that they have this i definitely want to\u00a0\u00a0\nsee if it takes some of it away but it says if you\u00a0\nwant healthier hair get to the root of the matter\u00a0\u00a0\nmade with salicylic acid and aloe extract this\u00a0\nis a luxurious sugar scrub that moisturizes your\u00a0\u00a0\nscalp and exfoliates it at the same time so i'm\u00a0\ndefinitely going to put this to the test probably\u00a0\u00a0\ntonight because i definitely need this right now\u00a0\noh this smells like a very clean light perfume\u00a0\u00a0\ni love it i love that none of their products smell\u00a0\noverpowering at all it actually just smells super\u00a0\u00a0\nclean and oh i really like the smell of this you\u00a0\nguys and the scrub is actually kind of like a\u00a0\u00a0\ngel like texture so i feel like it will be\u00a0\nvery very moisturizing on the scalp as well\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm really excited to try this one for sure\u00a0\nespecially since it has salicylic acid if you\u00a0\u00a0\nguys didn't know salicylic acid is really good if\u00a0\nyou do have any type of dandruff or if you have\u00a0\u00a0\npsoriasis in your scalp salicylic acid really does\u00a0\nhelp so i'm definitely going to put this to the\u00a0\u00a0\ntest for you guys for the next products they sent\u00a0\nme a rapid hair mask so this is made with shea\u00a0\u00a0\nbutter coconut milk and keratin and you guys know\u00a0\ni love keratin products i actually um do keratin\u00a0\u00a0\ntreatments on my hair all the time so the fact\u00a0\nthat it's in this hair mask it's like made for\u00a0\u00a0\nme i feel like this whole kit right here is made\u00a0\nfor me right now so this hair mask is supposed to\u00a0\u00a0\nsmooth damaged hair and calm your irritated scalp\u00a0\nin minutes keratin helps smooth your strands while\u00a0\u00a0\ncoconut milk and shea butter deeply conditions um\u00a0\nit says for the best results use the scalp scrub\u00a0\u00a0\nfirst and then use this so i'm definitely\u00a0\ngoing to use both of them at the same time\u00a0\u00a0\ni can't really describe the sense of these\u00a0\nthis actually smells like like very very\u00a0\u00a0\nhigh quality skincare it smells super clean and\u00a0\nsuper fresh i just can't put a finger on what it\u00a0\u00a0\nactually smells like i want to say it has like\u00a0\na hint of eucalyptus yes i definitely love all\u00a0\u00a0\nthe scents and all these products you guys\u00a0\nokay so next you guys know i love skincare\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm obsessed with trying out new skincare products\u00a0\nand they sent me a little package so i opened it\u00a0\u00a0\nearlier just to see like the size of all the\u00a0\nproducts but it came in a little ziploc thing\u00a0\u00a0\nlike this and this is for hydration so obviously\u00a0\nwe're in the cold winter months right now so\u00a0\u00a0\nmy skin is a little bit on the drier side so\u00a0\nthese are hydrating and gentle skincare essentials\u00a0\u00a0\nconsider your breakout prevention routine\u00a0\nrounded out okay so they sent me a deep sea\u00a0\u00a0\ncleanser this has seaweed extract and rose seeds\u00a0\nit's probably a very good everyday cleanser\u00a0\u00a0\nto help bring back all the moisture in your skin\u00a0\nso this is fragrance and dye free paraben free\u00a0\u00a0\nand not tested on animals so i feel like it will\u00a0\nbe good on my sensitive skin but obviously i have\u00a0\u00a0\nto try it out to make sure for you guys but i'm\u00a0\nreally excited to try this because i just love\u00a0\u00a0\nskincare so much they also gave me their tidal\u00a0\nwave moisturizer so this actually has hyaluronic\u00a0\u00a0\nacid and squalene and it's also no fragrance\u00a0\nand paraben free and yeah it actually has no\u00a0\u00a0\nfragrance at all because even though some products\u00a0\nsay they don't have fragrances i feel like some of\u00a0\u00a0\nthem still kind of do because they have too many\u00a0\nessential oils in there but this actually doesn't\u00a0\u00a0\nsmell like anything at all so i think it will be\u00a0\nperfect for my skin so now moving on to woman's\u00a0\u00a0\nhealth and wellness they sent me two products\u00a0\nhere and this one is a urinary tract powder\u00a0\u00a0\nso i feel like this is good if you have any like\u00a0\nutis or anything like that you can just take one\u00a0\u00a0\nof these and it will help clear it up for you\u00a0\ni don't have that problem right now but i feel\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it's always good to just have this just\u00a0\nin case because you never know what can happen\u00a0\u00a0\nand it since it's in a powder form i feel like you\u00a0\ncan just store this anywhere or take it on the go\u00a0\u00a0\nwith you or even travel with it and you'll be good\u00a0\nto go i actually have a lot of antioxidants and a\u00a0\u00a0\nlot of good vitamins in here as well it doesn't\u00a0\nhave too many sugars which is also very good\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm not going to actually review this\u00a0\none just because i don't need it right now\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i definitely feel like it's just a good thing\u00a0\nto have and that you can always get it on their\u00a0\u00a0\nwebsite if you ever do need that the next product\u00a0\nhere is also something that i probably won't try\u00a0\u00a0\nin this video if i ever do need this i know i\u00a0\nhave this on hand as well and this is the for hers\u00a0\u00a0\nvaginal cream so this is a vaginal anti-fungal\u00a0\nand you guys know like let's be real ladies\u00a0\u00a0\nwe do have issues down there sometimes and\u00a0\nsometimes like the ph balance of our women\u00a0\u00a0\nparts our lady parts aren't all the way balanced\u00a0\nall the time and it's okay to be real about it\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's why we have brands like this that help take\u00a0\ncare of us but this cures most yeast infections so\u00a0\u00a0\nto be honest i never really had a yeast infection\u00a0\never so if i ever do i feel like this will come in\u00a0\u00a0\nhandy but i love that they have things like this\u00a0\naccessible on their website so you can just order\u00a0\u00a0\nthem online without leaving your house and you ha\u00a0\nand you're good to go and it's always important to\u00a0\u00a0\nkeep yourself healthy ladies make sure you always\u00a0\nare aware of your body and what it's going through\u00a0\u00a0\nyou never know when you're going to need products\u00a0\nlike this so those are all the products that they\u00a0\u00a0\nsent me i'm very excited to give them a try i will\u00a0\nbe showing you guys how to use all the hair care\u00a0\u00a0\nand skincare and everything like that okay enough\u00a0\nof me rambling i'm just going to show you guys\u00a0\u00a0\nso starting off with the triple threat shampoo i\u00a0\nreally want to mention that this texture of this\u00a0\u00a0\nshampoo is very very thick i love it so much\u00a0\nbecause i feel like it really grabs on to the\u00a0\u00a0\nroots and you're really getting all of the dirt\u00a0\nout of your hair i feel like it also lathers up\u00a0\u00a0\nvery nicely so you're gonna get that really really\u00a0\nclean feel to your hair it's almost like a squeaky\u00a0\u00a0\nclean so if you guys don't like that feeling i\u00a0\ndefinitely think that you should get the hair mask\u00a0\u00a0\nas well but it's very very effective at cleaning\u00a0\nand detoxing your hair and so other products can\u00a0\u00a0\nwork on your hair more effectively so i really\u00a0\nlike this it smells so good it's really fresh\u00a0\u00a0\nand scent so your hair is just going to smell very\u00a0\nvery clean my hair also felt very very fresh after\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shower my roots feel like they can actually\u00a0\nbreathe so i definitely enjoyed using this\nnext i'm going in with the detox scalp scrub and i\u00a0\nlove the scent of this you guys that was the first\u00a0\u00a0\nthing i noticed about this product that i love\u00a0\nso much it also is made of sugar so you're not\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to have little beads in your hair after you\u00a0\nwash it out so that's what i like about it as well\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause i know a lot of scrubs tend to stay in my\u00a0\nhair for weeks and it's so hard to get it out but\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one actually dissolves so it will definitely\u00a0\nmoisturize your scalp as well as detox everything\u00a0\u00a0\nso i really do feel like it worked very very\u00a0\neffectively and i was actually impressed\u00a0\u00a0\nby how much it lathered up so it actually\u00a0\nfelt like i was shampooing my hair as well\u00a0\u00a0\nit was really easy to run it through my scalp\u00a0\nand wash it out so i definitely enjoyed this\u00a0\u00a0\nfor the next product i'm going in with their\u00a0\nrapid repair hair mask this is actually very\u00a0\u00a0\nvery moisturizing so even though we detox our hair\u00a0\nand it's squeaky clean we're putting the moisture\u00a0\u00a0\nright back into it and it honestly works so well\u00a0\nmy hair is very coarse and thick so not a lot of\u00a0\u00a0\nconditioners work for me so that's why i like\u00a0\nto use a hair mask more than a conditioner and\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one actually didn't make my hair fall out\u00a0\nat all i usually have that problem with almost\u00a0\u00a0\nevery single hair mask that i use my hair tends\u00a0\nto fall out and i didn't experience that with this\u00a0\u00a0\none so i like to just run this through my ends as\u00a0\nmuch as i can i really rub it in there and really\u00a0\u00a0\nconcentrate most of the product on the ends i\u00a0\nalso put it towards the root of the hair but\u00a0\u00a0\ni won't put it on the scalp i just like all of my\u00a0\nhair to feel soft and moisturized and ready to go\nnext product is their triple threat conditioner so\u00a0\ni like to use this as the last step because i like\u00a0\u00a0\nall the products to kind of seep into the hair\u00a0\nwhile i wash my body so i like to put this only\u00a0\u00a0\non the ends of the hair because i already have\u00a0\nthe hair mask on my hair so this is just an extra\u00a0\u00a0\nboost to soften everything up and detangle my hair\u00a0\ni feel like the conditioner is too lightweight\u00a0\u00a0\nfor my type of hair and so i need something very\u00a0\nvery heavy duty as far as making my hair softer\u00a0\u00a0\nand more moisturized so if you have thinner\u00a0\nhair i think the conditioner would be perfect\u00a0\u00a0\nso next for skin care i'm trying out their deep\u00a0\nsea cleanser i was really really surprised how\u00a0\u00a0\nthick this was as well it also lathers up very\u00a0\nnicely on dry skin so as you guys can see here\u00a0\u00a0\nmy skin looks wet but it's only just the cleanser\u00a0\nand it lathered up a lot so i really thought this\u00a0\u00a0\nwas a great product to double cleanse my skin\u00a0\nwhich is something i do every single night and\u00a0\u00a0\ni loved it because i didn't turn red or anything\u00a0\nat all i also didn't break out i didn't feel dry\u00a0\u00a0\nso this made my skin very very hydrated and\u00a0\nmoisturized and you guys will see now i'll\u00a0\u00a0\nadd water to my hands and lather it up even more\u00a0\ni really like this because it works so well for\u00a0\u00a0\nsensitive skin but i love that it lathers up so\u00a0\nmuch because i know some cleansers don't really\u00a0\u00a0\nlather up especially if they're for sensitive skin\u00a0\nso i really like this i actually been using it for\u00a0\u00a0\nweeks now and my skin is so moisturized\u00a0\nevery single day i feel like i don't\u00a0\u00a0\neven need the moisturizer but it made my skin\u00a0\nway softer so i definitely recommend this one\nnow for the moisturizer this is the tidal wave\u00a0\nmoisturizer i love this you guys will see right\u00a0\u00a0\nnow how well it really melted into my skin it made\u00a0\nmy skin instantly glowy it made it so moisturized\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i didn't feel that oily feeling that you get\u00a0\nfrom heavy moisturizers at all super lightweight\u00a0\u00a0\nbut it gives you that very very moisturized feel\u00a0\nand i loved it so much i was really impressed by\u00a0\u00a0\nthis moisturizer i actually put it on some\u00a0\nof my psoriasis and it healed it up within\u00a0\u00a0\na few days and i loved using this i feel\u00a0\nlike it really helped for my makeup to\u00a0\u00a0\nsit even better on my skin as well so i was\u00a0\nhonestly really impressed by this moisturizer\nso next for the hair growth products i had two\u00a0\ndifferent types of solutions here and the first\u00a0\u00a0\none i'm going to try is their foam one so this\u00a0\none i found that it was really easy to apply\u00a0\u00a0\nit was super precise so if you have any type of\u00a0\nspots in your hair that needs a little bit of love\u00a0\u00a0\nit's easier to apply especially in the front parts\u00a0\nof your hair so i'm just applying this on my baby\u00a0\u00a0\nhairs and just areas i feel like i lost a lot of\u00a0\nhair and the foam really just blends into the hair\u00a0\u00a0\nvery easily and you don't really feel like there's\u00a0\nproduct in your hair at all so i really liked it\u00a0\u00a0\nfor that so now i'm going to try the solution just\u00a0\nto compare the two but this one was really really\u00a0\u00a0\nrunny i feel like it would be great to just run\u00a0\nthrough your hair while it's wet and just run it\u00a0\u00a0\nthrough your roots this one was also easy to apply\u00a0\nbut this one tends to run down my face a lot so i\u00a0\u00a0\ndidn't really like that and i couldn't really\u00a0\nfocus it on certain areas without it running\u00a0\u00a0\nall over the place so that's the only thing i feel\u00a0\nlike it will still work really really well is just\u00a0\u00a0\nwhatever you guys prefer but i feel like i did see\u00a0\na lot of hair growth within the first two weeks of\u00a0\u00a0\nusing this so i think i will see full results in\u00a0\na few months but yeah i feel like both solutions\u00a0\u00a0\nwere really gentle on the scalp i really have a\u00a0\nsensitive scalp so nothing was burning nothing was\u00a0\u00a0\nturning red or anything like that so i definitely\u00a0\ndo think it's a great product especially if it\u00a0\u00a0\nworks in the long run but i'll have to let you\u00a0\nguys know hi guys so it's actually been about a\u00a0\u00a0\nfew weeks since i've used these products and i\u00a0\nwant to let you guys know which ones i'm loving\u00a0\u00a0\nand which ones i think are still worth your money\u00a0\nso i definitely love overall i love this brand\u00a0\u00a0\nin general i feel like they have such a great\u00a0\nthing going they have so many different products\u00a0\u00a0\nto choose from they tackle so many different\u00a0\nconcerns that we have as women and i just honestly\u00a0\u00a0\ni really enjoyed using every single product the\u00a0\nproducts that really stood out to me that i love\u00a0\u00a0\nthat i recommend 100 is definitely the skin\u00a0\ncare this is so so freaking amazing i actually\u00a0\u00a0\nenjoyed using this so much that it's almost gone\u00a0\nalready but this has really helped like healed up\u00a0\u00a0\nall my dryness on my skin and i like it because\u00a0\nit has no fragrance at all it was very gentle\u00a0\u00a0\non my sensitive skin and usually i get kind\u00a0\nof red when i wash my face because i do have\u00a0\u00a0\nreactive skin but this honestly has been so great\u00a0\ni didn't get red at all i didn't break out at all\u00a0\u00a0\nand it's honestly made my skin so moisturized and\u00a0\ni haven't experienced this with any other skincare\u00a0\u00a0\nespecially when it comes down to the cleanser i\u00a0\nalways feel like i have to add moisturizer but\u00a0\u00a0\nthis has been amazing it's also really good at\u00a0\nlike taking off your makeup as well so i really\u00a0\u00a0\nlike their moisturizer because i have psoriasis\u00a0\nright so psoriasis is like dry patches on your\u00a0\u00a0\nskin it's kind of hard to get rid of it because\u00a0\nit's very very textured it's very very like rough\u00a0\u00a0\nso some moisturizers just lay on top of it and\u00a0\nit doesn't really kind of like penetrate into the\u00a0\u00a0\ndryness enough for it to go away this moisturizer\u00a0\ni accidentally put it on my psoriasis because i\u00a0\u00a0\nhave a little bit like on my ear right here and i\u00a0\nput it on there and it made it go away literally\u00a0\u00a0\nthe next day my skin was so soft and smooth\u00a0\nand i have a little bit as well in my hairline\u00a0\u00a0\nand you guys can't even see it because it's almost\u00a0\ngone just because i've been using this moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0\nand i feel like i want to put this all over my\u00a0\nbody i wish they had a whole body butter just of\u00a0\u00a0\nthis because this has been like life-changing\u00a0\nfor me i really really like their skin care i\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel like this is definitely worth your money\u00a0\ndefinitely highly recommend especially if you\u00a0\u00a0\nhave acne prone skin if you have trouble finding\u00a0\na good everyday skincare simple steps as well just\u00a0\u00a0\na moisturizer and a cleanser and i feel like it\u00a0\nwould work really well with other products as well\u00a0\u00a0\nso yeah i love this so much so for the next\u00a0\nproduct i really love i've actually been using\u00a0\u00a0\nthis twice a week for a while now and i just\u00a0\ngenuinely love this product so much because it\u00a0\u00a0\nchanged the way i like care for my hair so this\u00a0\nis the detox scrub the detox scrub is amazing\u00a0\u00a0\nit smells so amazing as well but i love this scrub\u00a0\nbecause i try a lot of different scalp scrubs\u00a0\u00a0\nand a lot of them have little beads in\u00a0\nit and it always gets stuck in my hair\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'll have beads in my hair in my scalp for\u00a0\nabout weeks until actually washes out of my hair\u00a0\u00a0\nthis scrub is actually so effective at clearing\u00a0\nup all the dryness in my scalp but it's also\u00a0\u00a0\nvery good at clearing the scalp as well you're\u00a0\nactually going to get really good exfoliation\u00a0\u00a0\nbut since it's a sugar scrub it actually\u00a0\ndissolves right then in there in your hair\u00a0\u00a0\nafter you've washed it out so it doesn't leave\u00a0\nyou a residue in your scalp it doesn't leave you\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle pebbles in your hair like you'll actually\u00a0\nbe able to wash it out and your hair will smell\u00a0\u00a0\ngreat and your scalp will be moisturized and\u00a0\nclear and i just really enjoyed using this\u00a0\u00a0\ni haven't found a scalp scrub like this ever\u00a0\nbefore so i really want to stock up on this but\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah guys it smells amazing as well so give us a\u00a0\ntry if you try anything for the hair care give us\u00a0\u00a0\na try okay so moving on to the other products that\u00a0\ni've tried you guys know i tried the shampoo and\u00a0\u00a0\nconditioner this one has been amazing on my hair\u00a0\ni really like it because it actually cleans your\u00a0\u00a0\nhair so well especially in the scalp and i do feel\u00a0\nlike it gives me a little bit of thickening effect\u00a0\u00a0\nin my roots so obviously i have to use this\u00a0\nfor a while to actually get the full results\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i love the scents of these they smell\u00a0\nso great the only thing is my hair does feel\u00a0\u00a0\nvery very squeaky clean after i use this so\u00a0\ni don't like to use it too often i definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel like it works if you're looking for a shampoo\u00a0\nor conditioner that really thickens the hair and\u00a0\u00a0\ncleans it really well i definitely do feel like it\u00a0\nworks i'll keep using this as well and just to see\u00a0\u00a0\nlike how my hair is in the next few months or so\u00a0\nbut yeah the shampoo and conditioner are great i\u00a0\u00a0\nlike the scents and that's like the most important\u00a0\nthing to me when it comes down to shampoo honestly\u00a0\u00a0\ni also really enjoyed the hair mask the hair\u00a0\nmask really smoothed out all of my hair it made\u00a0\u00a0\nit really really soft and you guys know like\u00a0\nif you don't get a haircut in a while and your\u00a0\u00a0\nends tend to get super dry and for me since i have\u00a0\nreally coarse hair you can actually see how dry it\u00a0\u00a0\nis without even having to touch my hair so i used\u00a0\nit on my ends mainly every time i washed my hair\u00a0\u00a0\nso even though these made me feel squeaky clean\u00a0\nthe hair mask actually put a lot a lot of moisture\u00a0\u00a0\nin my hair to where my hair was actually\u00a0\nsilky smooth so i actually recommend that\u00a0\u00a0\nto you guys the hair mask is honestly really\u00a0\nreally bomb i just feel like the scrub was\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething i definitely needed for the type of skin\u00a0\nthat i have right now or the type of hair problems\u00a0\u00a0\ni have right now but i definitely do love the\u00a0\nmask as well it really does work it detangles\u00a0\u00a0\nso effortlessly my hair smells amazing every time\u00a0\ni use it my hair is way more moisturized so i can\u00a0\u00a0\ngo longer without getting a haircut and my hair\u00a0\nwill still look healthy and moisturized and shiny\u00a0\u00a0\nso i also noticed that the hair\u00a0\nmask doesn't make my hair fall out\u00a0\u00a0\ni mentioned this in some of my other videos where\u00a0\na lot of conditioners actually make my hair come\u00a0\u00a0\nout but that one actually didn't even have any\u00a0\nfallout from using it at all and i was using it\u00a0\u00a0\nlike twice a week because it was working so\u00a0\nwell for me so i definitely recommend that\u00a0\u00a0\none too if you guys need any type of repair to\u00a0\nyour hair or if you just want some moisture it\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely definitely works moving on to the next\u00a0\nproducts i have been using the biotin builders\u00a0\u00a0\nthis tastes so good it tastes like candy\u00a0\nso i've been just eating them because they\u00a0\u00a0\njust taste really good but i definitely\u00a0\ndo think it's always good to have vitamins\u00a0\u00a0\nin your diet in your everyday routine it really\u00a0\nhelps just to keep everything healthy and keep\u00a0\u00a0\nyour hair growing of course and i just honestly\u00a0\nreally do feel like these taste so good so if you\u00a0\u00a0\nguys need a good biotin vitamin these are it now\u00a0\nmoving on to the hair growth products so for these\u00a0\u00a0\ni did have the foam and the regular solution so\u00a0\num i believe the foam is a little bit stronger\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i definitely like the foam better because it's\u00a0\nmore controllable it doesn't run down your face or\u00a0\u00a0\nanything like that and it's just easier to apply\u00a0\ni feel like especially if you want like a certain\u00a0\u00a0\narea to grow it definitely works better in the in\u00a0\nthe foam form so i didn't really use this one too\u00a0\u00a0\noften i did use it a few times just to run through\u00a0\nmy scalp when my hair was wet but other than that\u00a0\u00a0\ni genuinely think that the foam works really\u00a0\nreally well i like to use this along my hairline\u00a0\u00a0\nso i like to grow out my baby hairs especially\u00a0\nif i have a lot of breakage or anything like that\u00a0\u00a0\nand then i also did the solution like\u00a0\nthroughout the whole hair as far as like\u00a0\u00a0\nhow good these products work i definitely feel\u00a0\nlike i had new regrowth in my hair but it is so\u00a0\u00a0\nso tiny like little tiny hairs popping out so\u00a0\nit's kind of hard to actually see the results\u00a0\u00a0\nso honestly guys i would probably have to try this\u00a0\nfor a few months to give you a full review about\u00a0\u00a0\nit but i definitely feel like it works i think\u00a0\nyou just have to use it for a long period of time\u00a0\u00a0\nso if you guys are interested in getting these\u00a0\ndefinitely get the foam i feel like it just works\u00a0\u00a0\nway better as far as how you can apply it but\u00a0\ni definitely love that they have this because\u00a0\u00a0\ni didn't honestly didn't really know i needed\u00a0\nthis until now and now i can just have something\u00a0\u00a0\nto maintain my hair especially when you know you\u00a0\nhave a lot of stress your hair tends to fall out\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe your diet is not as good maybe you just have\u00a0\nless volume in your hair and you kind of want to\u00a0\u00a0\ntry to grow it a little bit more i definitely do\u00a0\nfeel like i saw some little regrowths within like\u00a0\u00a0\na week or two so it did work pretty fast it's just\u00a0\nfor me i don't i can't really tell if my hair is\u00a0\u00a0\nthicker or growing more but i definitely do love\u00a0\nthat they have products like this just in case for\u00a0\u00a0\nanyone who is struggling with a lot of hair loss i\u00a0\nknow like postpartum and stuff like that for women\u00a0\u00a0\nis a big thing so i definitely love that\u00a0\nthey cover that for everyone so so for the\u00a0\u00a0\nother products obviously i didn't really get to\u00a0\ntry those out those were the vaginal cream and\u00a0\u00a0\nthe uti powder i just don't have that issue right\u00a0\nnow so i can't really give you guys a full review\u00a0\u00a0\nabout that i just love that they have a lot\u00a0\nof products to help you take care of yourself\u00a0\u00a0\nfully so i definitely enjoyed using for hers if\u00a0\nyou guys want to try out any of these products\u00a0\u00a0\ni know they have this triple threat system if\u00a0\nyou guys want to try out any of the hair growth\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts it comes in all in one kit for you\u00a0\nguys so you guys can purchase this and try it\u00a0\u00a0\nout for yourselves i do have a link

        "transcript_text": "Hello everybody, welcome back to my\nchannel where skincare is all about\nprogression over perfection. Because,\nperfection doesn't exist. I want to start\noff the New Year, this year, by basically\nlike sharing and confirming some of the\nbest tips I've picked up for some of the,\nwhat I consider, the most important steps\nof the skincare routine. I feel like we\nlive through so many skincare trends, so\nmany do's and don'ts and I've tried all\nof these, I've tried all these tips and\nhacks and techniques. And I want to share\nwhat I feel are those best techniques.\nNot because they're like amazingly like\ninnovative but just because they seem\nto work well for my skin. Today's video\nis sponsored by COSRX. I love COSRX. If\nyou don't know that I love COSRX you've\nnot been watching enough of my videos.\nAnd we'll be using COSRX products for\neach step of the routine. If you like the\nlook of any products in today's video\nyou can get 30% off at COSRX.com using\nthe code JAMESGIFTWITHCOSRX. But you\ncan also get these products from Ulta,\nAmazon, Boots here in the UK, Shoppy and\nLook Fantastic. And all the links for\nthese products will be in the\ndescription box down below. So COSRX\nactually now have mascots for their\nbrand, it's so cute. They got Sunny the\nSnail who is like COSRX's brand\nambassador, who represents the\nbest-selling Advanced Snail Mucin\ncollection, which we're going to be using\ntoday. And really this line is catered\nfor those with sensitive skin, irritated\nskin, acne-prone, and dry skin. The\nAdvanced Snail line is my go-to line for\nwhen I've ruined my skin but I still\nwant to do all my steps, you know? Because\nI know it's not going to irritate my\nskin any further. So, Sunny the Snail is\nactually a cosmetic formulator,\nwho according to them works all day long at\nthe snail farm to create high quality\nskincare formulas. And on that note, I\nwant to talk about this, the Snail\ningredient in here. So how they extract\nthe Snail Mucin is that they actually\nput snails over a mesh in a dark and\nquiet room so they're undisturbed for\nabout 30 minutes to freely roam around\nthe net, and then of course leave their\nMucin trails. There's nothing else done,\nthere's nothing done to force the snails\nto produce Mucin, they're just left to\nroam around these nets. So let's get into\nthe tips and techniques, and let's of\ncourse start with the cleansing stage. We\nwill be using the Advanced Snail Mucin\nGel Cleanser from COSRX. Sorry, I actually\nuse these products so they're a little bit...\nnot dirty but they look used.\nSo of course we have Snail Mucin in here\nwhich is extremely hydrating, also helps\nprotect the skin and it gives it that\nkind of like gloopy texture. And this\nhelps keep your skin feeling hydrated\nwhilst you're washing. And a non-drying\nlather as well, and that's what I love\nabout this cleanser and how cleansers\nshould be in general, and what we want\nfrom cleansers nowadays, is this\nnon-stripping, very lightly foaming\nformulation, so. So when it comes to\ncleansing there's quite a few tips and\ntechniques that I absolutely love, that I feel\nhave actually made a big difference. And\nI feel like the cleanser stage is kind\nof like a throwaway stage, right? People\nlike are kind of like, oh just get this bit\ndone, rinse it away then go into your\nserums and all your fancier stuff. But\nthese little changes make such a huge\ndifference. So these are a few tips but\ncount them all as one. We know the\ntemperature of water is important, right.\nNot too cold, not too hot, lukewarm water.\nIt's not gonna strip or dehydrate your\nskin if you use lukewarm water. Making\nsure you cleanse your whole face is\nanother thing, so we all know the 60\nsecond cleanse, it's a popular technique\nthat most aestheticians get taught in\naesthetician school. But when it comes to\nthe surfactants and the science behind\nyour cleansers, you don't really need to\ncleanse for 60 seconds. What I think that\nis good at doing is just ensuring that\nyou're covering your whole face. This\nmeans taking time to make sure you're\ncleansing all those little places that\nyou might forget. For me, I forget to do\nthese bits on my nose, I forget to do\nthis bit on my chin, I forget to do my\ntemples. And I always break out in those\nplaces, basically because I wasn't\ncleaning them properly. Whilst you don't\nhave to cleanse for 60 seconds, just\ngently taking your time and massaging in\nall places on your face is what is very\nbeneficial. Most importantly, flannels. I\nwas very anti-flannel because I think\nwhen I was a teenager I would use these to\nscrub at my face. Flannels, wash cloths.\nBut yes, I'll use them to scrub things\naway on my face when really they can be\nso, so gentle. I didn't really use these\nuntil I got some fancy ones in PR. I\ncan't remember what they are now, they've\ngot like silver in them or something. I\ndon't think the science is quite there\nfor that. The idea is that they're not\nmeant to harbour bacteria on them but I\ndon't know, I don't really know. But after\nfoaming up my cleanser and rinsing the\ncleanser away, then lightly patting a\nflannel over the face, a washcloth over\ntheir face ensures that I'm getting rid\nof all the cleansers. So I'll wipe very\ngently\nin areas where, again, I was breaking out\nor areas where I feel like the water\ndidn't quite get rid of it. So in places\nlike my beard, corners and crevices, my\neyebrows, my hairline. Making sure that\nthere's not any of the cleanser sat\nthere which could, further down the line,\nbreak me out. I don't get breakouts, I\nused to get breakouts along here all the\ntime, I don't get it anymore. The next\nproduct we're going to talk about is the\niconic\ncult favorite, we've got the Advanced\nSnail Radiance Duel Essence. Which, you\nknow I love. It's like a Snail Mucin and\nNiacinamide, 2-in-1. But, the original,\nthe iconic Advanced Snail 96 Mucin\nPower Essence is an essence I feel like\neveryone can love and benefit from. This\nis a super lightweight essence, so it's\ngot this stretchy gloopy texture to it\nthat makes it a little bit thicker\nthan your normal essence but it still\ngoes on super lightweight and sinks into\nthe skin effortlessly. It feels super\nhydrating as well. And it just gives you\nsuch a nice natural glow. This contains\n96.3%\nSnail Secretion Filtrate, helping to\nrepair your skin, relieve it of any\nirritation and dryness. We also have\nSodium Hyaluronate in here, again, helping\nto hydrate your skin. These are super\nsimple formulas, so if you do find that\nyour skin is getting quite irritated and\nyou just want to help repair it but you\nstill enjoy doing your skincare routine,\nthis whole line is perfect for that. And\nthese products have actually helped\nthose with acne quite a fair bit. This is\na before and after, after using the\nAdvanced Snail Mucin Power Essence\nfor about three weeks. So when I apply my\nessences and toners I always do it on\ndamp skin, we know that this helps to\nhydrate your skin even more so than the\ntoner, essence are gonna do. Because damp\nskin allows for penetration of those\ningredients but also makes most\nwater-loving ingredients work to their\nfullest as well. It gives you that dewy,\nplump look to your skin pretty instantly,\nwithin like 15 minutes you're gonna get\nthis dewy plump glow. Temporary but it\nstill looks good. One thing I do all the\ntime with my toners and essences though is\nmake these little point masks. Now, point\nmasks are simply like a DIY sheet mask\non particular points of your skin that\nneed that extra attention. An essence\nlike this is perfect to help target\nthose more dehydrated and drier areas. So\nwhat I do is take a cotton pad, split\nthat in two, soak them in the essence and\nthen leave them on my skin for about 10\nto 15 minutes, and then wipe them away\nand make the most of that essence. What\nthis is gonna do is rehydrate that skin,\nmoisturize that skin, brighten it, soothe\nany itchiness or irritation as well. And\nyou could do this every day, there's no\nreason you can't do this every day just\nto help rehydrate and re-moisturize, and\npay extra attention to those more worrisome places. No, what's the word?\nNot troublesome... yeah, troublesome areas\nof skin, I guess. The next step is an eye\ncream. I am a new lover of eye creams\nbecause I can now see the difference\nthat they make when you pick a good\none, and when you do certain things with\nthem. So this is the Advanced Snail\nPeptide Eye Cream. You have seen this in\nso many videos, it was my number one eye\ncream of 2021. Snail secretion in here is,\nof course, going to help moisturize and\nbrighten under the eyes. Some Niacinamide \nto help with your barrier,\nbrighten under the eyes as well. And\nCopper Tripeptide which does so many\nthings, helping to stimulate the\nproduction of things like collagen and\nelastin. But most importantly this is\nsuper lightweight. The lid is so dirty\nbecause I use it every day but it's\nsuper lightweight. You don't have to\nspend ages like tapping it into your skin,\nlike spreading it everywhere, it's just\nfluidy but moisturizing at the same time.\nI feel like it's important to hack this\nstage because I feel like whilst this\nproduct works amazingly on its own, you\nget that instant brightness from this\nproduct. You can push any eye cream that\none step further by using things like\nreusable eye masks, they are a game\nchanger. You put your eye cream on, your\nfavorite eye cream, put the eye patch\nover. I let them sit for about half an\nhour, and you can see the physical\ndifference when you take that off. But\nalso the long term difference that\ncovering your eye cream makes, it just\nkind of like puffs out under your eyes\nin a good way or de-puffs... do you know what I mean?\nIt kind of like settles it, and make them look less sunken in. The brightness that you get\nfrom it, the instant brightness. And you\ndon't need under eye patches, my favorite\nones are from Dieux Skin. I've tried some\nother reusable ones that, to be honest\nwith you, aren't that good. But what you\ncan do is use plastic wrap or cling film.\nI found this like tape version of it on\nAmazon and you can just break off little\nbits of that and put it under your eye\nand you still have that kind of like\ncovering that creates that occlusive\nlayer, allowing all those ingredients to\nwork their fullest. Brightening and\nde-puffing under your eyes, I absolutely\nlove it. This is like one of the eye\ncreams that works best with that. Or you\ncan just use eye patches. Eye patches are\namazing, especially these ones, the\nAdvanced, the Advanced Snail Hydrogel\nEye Patches. These are covered in, I wish\nthey did a Snail serum like this, just\nthe serum from this.\nThese eye patches are incredibly like\nhydrating, moisturizing. And when you\nleave them on under your eyes, quite\nnicely plumping as well. Again, like the\neye cream, you have Snail Filtrate and\nNiacinamide. So you get that nice kind of\nlike moisturized dewy brighter look\nunder your eyes with consistent use. So\nyou do actually get two different sizes\nin here but I love using the giant patch\nbecause I will use this in the serum\nstage. So I actually put them under my\neyes which covers your whole cheek and\non the forehead as well. I let those sit\nfor like 10 to 15 minutes and just rub\nthat all over my skin. What you must do\nwith eye patches though, and I see this\nall the time, is use it in the serum\nstage. I see people putting these\nover clay masks, cream masks that you then\nhave to wash off. There's no point doing\nthis because basically, again, they're\ncovered in serum that you need to leave\non your skin. So washing it away is a\nwaste of time, it's a waste of product, it's\na waste of money. And other than\nsunscreen, which we're not talking about\ntoday, the moisturizing stage for me is\none of the most important stages. And\nagain, if you watch my videos I know\nyou're probably sick to death of\nhearing of this product but the Advanced\nSnail 92 All-In-One Cream from COSRX.\nThis contains 92%, as the name suggests,\nSnail Mucin. So you're getting that\nhydration, you're getting moisturized.\nYour skin is going to look nice and\nplump and dewy. And this, this like gides\nover your face, you need the tiniest amount, and it just makes your skin look dewy but from\nwithin. It's not sticky or greasy feeling or\nlooking. It can also help to repair your\nskin as well, if you're finding your skin\nis irritated, itchy in some places. Again,\none of my go-to products that I know my\nskin is safe with when I've destroyed my\nskin. So yes, I love this product. Of\ncourse the best tips for applying\nmoisturizer is to apply it onto damp\nskin. Again, those hydration loving\ningredients are going to just look even\nmore dewy and plump on your skin. So the\nnext tip I'm about to give you, this\ndoesn't work so well with, because I find\nthat this just perfectly covers all\ndifferent areas of my skin. I'm dry here\nand here and in here, then like greasy\noily t-zone. And this product just seems\nto work perfectly for all different skin\ntypes on my own face. So, this doesn't\nwork so well with this particular\nmoisturizer because this is just a great\nlike all in one but what I like to do\nwith other moisturizers is apply a super\nthin layer on my skin, and then I like to\nlet it settle for about 30 minutes. I'll\ndo other bits and then I'll go back and\nlook at my skin and areas where the\nmoisturizers kind of like disappeared\nand I still look dry, I know those are\nareas I have to concentrate on. I\nactually learned this from my brother\nwho's a makeup artist, if you don't know\nhim already. And he uses this tip when\napplying makeup to clients. So what I get\nfrom that is that I need to pay more\nattention to those areas when it comes\nto hydrating my skin, and moisturizing my\nskin. So I apply more moisturizer on\nthose drier areas, then I know going\nforward I need to concentrate more on\nthose areas. And again, it's those areas\nyou usually miss like the temple, in\nbetween here, here, in the corners of your\nnose. Because we just kind of rush\nthrough everything and we forget those\nlittle crevices. So yes, there we go. I\nhope you enjoyed those tips and this is\nbasically how I do my skincare routine\nwhatever the products are, whatever the\nbrand is, whatever step I'm doing.\nRemember to use this discount code at\nCOSRX.com if you want to purchase any of\nthe products in today's video.

They are absolutely worth the upfront cost both environmental and financially. I can use them with any eye serum or cream and they make my 40 year old under-slept undereyes look soooo good. They\u2019ve held up beautifully for about a year so far.",

Reading that in testing the mask lasted 1 year with daily use before the logo faded, made me do a quick calculation of how much my one time patches would cost me a year... way more than 25 + much more packaging!"

look\u00a0\nwith my new charlotte tilbury luxury palette\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is in the shade the rock cheek or rock\u00a0\nchic i don't know how you say it but i'm excited\u00a0\u00a0\nto try this palette on and do an eye look and\u00a0\nlet's see how this foundation looks on my face\u00a0\u00a0\nso let's play with this two products yeah if\u00a0\nyou're new to my channel i would love to have\u00a0\u00a0\nyou here please subscribe down below it means so\u00a0\nmuch to me and now let's get right into the video\u00a0\u00a0\nmy face is primed i use my glow recipe niacinamide\u00a0\ndew drops and let's start with this foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nnow this is a luminous silk perfect glow\u00a0\nflawless foundation mine is in the shade too\u00a0\u00a0\nthe bottle is just stunning very luxe looking\u00a0\nthis retails for 82 canadian now it says that\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is an award-winning oil-free foundation that\u00a0\ndelivers buildable medium coverage and a luminous\u00a0\u00a0\nglowy skin finish for a natural makeup look i'm\u00a0\ngoing to apply one side with a brush one side with\u00a0\u00a0\na sponge and see which one we like better so again\u00a0\nit comes with a pump i'll put on the back here\u00a0\u00a0\nthis much it's liquidy but not too bad so i'm\u00a0\ngonna go into my moda pro glow foundation brush\u00a0\u00a0\nand do this side with the brush\u00a0\nand see which side looks better\nokay so i right away am noticing a beautiful\u00a0\nluminous glow to the skin the skin still looks\u00a0\u00a0\nlike my skin very a little bit more coverage\u00a0\nbut you can see that they're very similar\u00a0\u00a0\nso i guess this is buildable if\u00a0\nyou want to give yourself a more\u00a0\u00a0\nmedium coverage now let's apply this\u00a0\nnow with a sponge and see on this side\u00a0\u00a0\nso i pumped another pump for the sponge and\u00a0\nlet's go in with the beauty blender and see\nokay so right away i can tell you that this\u00a0\napplies much better with the sponge it's\u00a0\u00a0\nhard to tell but i think it has more coverage\u00a0\napplying with the sponge it's very interesting\u00a0\u00a0\nthis looks a little bit more hydrating\u00a0\non this side than this side so i'm going\u00a0\u00a0\nto use now the beauty blender and kind of\u00a0\nget into the side with the brush so this is\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can apply it either or it works with both but\u00a0\ni think you get a little bit more coverage when\u00a0\u00a0\nyou apply it with the sponge in this case which\u00a0\nis interesting because you would think that the\u00a0\u00a0\nsponge would actually absorb the product but it\u00a0\ndoes look better with the sponge side i think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat it blended beautifully so now you guys are\u00a0\nzoomed up close so you guys can see the complexion\ni think it looks stunning what do you guys think\u00a0\nit looks very hydrating it doesn't feel drying on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe face i am loving what i'm feeling on my face\u00a0\nit feels very hydrating and very light looks very\u00a0\u00a0\nnatural perfect match with my neck i think it\u00a0\njust looks beautiful so now i'm gonna go ahead\u00a0\u00a0\nand finish the rest of my complexion and i'm gonna\u00a0\nput a timestamp down below where i'm gonna review\u00a0\u00a0\nthis palette and do an eye look in case you want\u00a0\nto skip through all of this other applications\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm going to start with my gucci bronzer i\u00a0\nhaven't used this in a while this is in the shade\u00a0\u00a0\n2. so let's apply this all over the face very\u00a0\nvery pigmented so a little bit goes a long way\ni think that this bronzer looks very nice\u00a0\non top of this foundation i think today i'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna use my nars and this is in the shade\u00a0\nlight one it's this um creamy concealer\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich i'm just gonna lighten\u00a0\nup this area right here\nnow for highlighter i'm gonna use\u00a0\nmy makeup by mario in the shade\u00a0\u00a0\npearl this is such a beautiful highlighter\nlook at that stunning highlighter i love it\nand for my blush i'm using the rare beauty\u00a0\nblush in the shade nearly neutral and it's this\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful blush and i think i'm\u00a0\ngonna go in with my beauty blender\nthat bit i think it works really good this way\u00a0\u00a0\nthis blush is so beautiful and it applies\u00a0\nthe best with a dampened beauty blender\u00a0\u00a0\nlook how fast you see how fast the complexion\u00a0\nis done so now let's move right along to the\u00a0\u00a0\neyeshadow palette so let me prime my eye i'm going\u00a0\nto use the ace beauty eyeshadow primer so i'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to use my pat mcgrath under eye powder just\u00a0\nto powder here where we put concealer so we don't\u00a0\u00a0\nhave any creasing problems so let me show you the\u00a0\npalette so this is the quad by charlotte tilbury\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is called the rock chic and this retails for\u00a0\n66 canadian now this looks like it's out of stock\u00a0\u00a0\nat the moment but this luxury eyeshadow palette is\u00a0\nlooks stunning i can't wait to show you the colors\u00a0\u00a0\nregular charlotte tilbury quad out the outer part\u00a0\nof the packaging and inside it looks like this\npretty i love this shades i'm gonna insert a\u00a0\nvideo of it so you guys can see it up close\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i'm gonna swatch the shades for you because\u00a0\nthey are so pretty so it says that it comes\u00a0\u00a0\nwith a primer which is this one number one\u00a0\nthen the number two is you enhance your eye\u00a0\u00a0\nnumber three you smoke it and number four you\u00a0\ncreate a pop on top of the eyelid so we're gonna\u00a0\u00a0\ncreate a full look using all of the shades but\u00a0\nthis is then kind of to give you an idea on how\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shades look like this is going to be of a nice\u00a0\ncool tone look i'm excited so i'm going to start\u00a0\u00a0\nwith this one right here and kind of put\u00a0\nit in all over like above and create a\u00a0\u00a0\ntransition with it so i'm going to use\u00a0\nthis e2 brush by blinked brushes and\u00a0\u00a0\nput this kind of all over the eyelid and bring\u00a0\nit up above the crease let me zoom you guys in\nthis feels like a cream to powder shade\u00a0\u00a0\nso it looks powdery in the pan but when you apply\u00a0\nit it feels like you're applying cream on your eye\nthat looks very easy it's very easy to blend\u00a0\nvery smooth it looks beautiful i love it okay\u00a0\u00a0\nso let's move on to the next one which\u00a0\nis this gray one and add this again this\u00a0\u00a0\nhas some shimmer i'm going to try use the same\u00a0\nbrush you'll see and add this in the crease here\nwe'll see if this is too big or not\nyeah let's get into a smaller\u00a0\nbrush and kind of blend it now\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm using a real techniques\u00a0\nbrush this is the crease brush\nso there's absolutely no fallout\u00a0\nlet's intensify this a bit more\nokay so this blended out beautifully beautifully\u00a0\ni love the shades this reminds me of those\u00a0\u00a0\nessence quads i have one that looks very very\u00a0\nsimilar this is a very simple and easy to use\u00a0\u00a0\npalette you can stop here you can smoke\u00a0\nit you can just use the glittery part\u00a0\u00a0\nbut we're gonna go into this smokey one\u00a0\nthe darker one and i'm gonna use the e5 by\u00a0\u00a0\nblinked brushes which is more of a flat brush\u00a0\nand i'm going to intensify this outer corner\nso i'm just patting the outer corner and\u00a0\ndistributing it on the outer side of the eyelid\u00a0\u00a0\ntowards the crease as well wow this\u00a0\npalette is so so easy to work with\u00a0\u00a0\ni love her palettes i have another one by her\u00a0\nwhich is this one the green one it says green\u00a0\u00a0\nlights and it's kind of this is all shimmers and\u00a0\nthey blend so beautifully now in here i have the\u00a0\u00a0\none matte the very shimmery one and then i\u00a0\nmean very glittery one and then this are the\u00a0\u00a0\nshimmery shades here and they they blend\u00a0\nlike so easy to use like anyone can use this\u00a0\u00a0\npalette and it's so fast i love that it's\u00a0\nsmall you can bring it with you anywhere\u00a0\u00a0\ntravel with it it's just beautiful so i'm\u00a0\ngonna leave it as this right now i'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\ncontinue with the same brush and dip into this\u00a0\ndark gray and go underneath my lower lash line\nand i'll go into my first brush my real\u00a0\ntechniques and blend this lower lash line\ni love the shades i love these cool tones i think\u00a0\nthat they are so stunning and so easy to work with\u00a0\u00a0\nso for the inner corner let's go now\u00a0\nwith this beautiful glittery shade\u00a0\u00a0\nand i'm gonna use it on my finger and\u00a0\nlet's put it in the inner corner wow\nvery glittery there's absolutely no fallout and\u00a0\u00a0\nit is not chunky very easy to blend and\u00a0\nit's very like bright and shiny i love it\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's not even one glitter fallout\u00a0\non my face do you guys see that\u00a0\u00a0\nnothing what i want to do is maybe go into this\u00a0\num lighter gray here with a small pencil well this\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of not that small but it's this type of brush\u00a0\nby moda and i just want to add it underneath here\u00a0\u00a0\nso we can tie in the colors together a bit\u00a0\nand let's clean this outer corner with this\u00a0\u00a0\nconcealer brush a bit and i think i'm gonna go in\u00a0\nwith a small brush which is very similar to the\u00a0\u00a0\none we used and i'm gonna go into this lighter\u00a0\nshade and try to add this in the inner corner\u00a0\u00a0\nsee if it does anything oh yeah look you\u00a0\ncan use that in the inner corner it's\u00a0\u00a0\nit does brighten up the inner\u00a0\ncorner right there do you see that\u00a0\u00a0\nlooks very pretty and i'm going to use\u00a0\nthis underneath my brow bone of course\nwow look at that now this palette is all you need\u00a0\ni'm going to give you my final thoughts at the end\u00a0\u00a0\nbut you guys can tell how excited i am and i think\u00a0\nthat the eyes look so beautiful with the shades\u00a0\u00a0\nwe make sure that everything is blended the eye\u00a0\nlook i'm gonna go ahead and apply some mascara and\u00a0\u00a0\ni will be right back to show you the final look of\u00a0\nthe eyes and then we're gonna apply some lipstick\u00a0\u00a0\nso in the meantime enjoy this intermission\nokay so here are the eyes up close so i'm gonna\u00a0\nshow you up close how they look i think that the\u00a0\u00a0\neyes turned out so beautiful i love the shades\u00a0\nit's just a beautiful smoky grayish very cool\u00a0\u00a0\ntone look and i don't know if you don't like\u00a0\ncool tones you might not like this palette\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i'm telling you that this shades are so\u00a0\neasy to work with this shade i love a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause you can use it all over the eyelid what\u00a0\ni did or you can use it to highlight your inner\u00a0\u00a0\ncorner and your brow bone and all those other\u00a0\nshades have no fallout and they created this\u00a0\u00a0\nnice smoky look i think that this quad is\u00a0\nstunning i love the green one that i have\u00a0\u00a0\nand with gold which is more warm tone\u00a0\nand i love this cool tone palette i i\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely recommend this palette i love all\u00a0\nof her quads if i can have them all i would but\u00a0\u00a0\ni have the green one in this like i said and\u00a0\nit's just beautiful now let me zoom you out\u00a0\u00a0\noh and the foundation what do you guys think the\u00a0\nfoundation is still on the face i think that the\u00a0\u00a0\nlonger it stayed on the face it has melted in\u00a0\non the skin and it made the look a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nmore natural less foundation look like type\u00a0\nof skin very silky looking very smooth there's\u00a0\u00a0\nno dry spots very hydrating it has not settled\u00a0\ninto my smile lines underneath my eyes i think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat is just beautiful okay so for the lips i have\u00a0\nsomething i haven't used in a while and i got this\u00a0\u00a0\nin a boxy charm and this is my hank and henry\u00a0\nlipstick this is in the shade this is a satin\u00a0\u00a0\nmatte lipstick in the shade s e x t and check this\u00a0\nout you push this button right here and there's\u00a0\u00a0\nthe lipstick this is a beautiful shade and look\u00a0\nat this i'll show you what the lipstick looks like\nyou guys see those glitters but\u00a0\nwhen you apply it there's no glitter\u00a0\u00a0\non your lips it's very very interesting so\nthere's absolutely no glitter there\u00a0\u00a0\nsuch a beautiful lipstick such a nice\u00a0\nneutral shade so let's apply this to the lips\nand there are the lips i love this lipstick i\u00a0\nhaven't used it in a while it's been sitting\u00a0\u00a0\nhere on my desk but this color is just it's\u00a0\njust stunning it looks beautiful on the lips\u00a0\u00a0\nit's a very matte lipstick but it's not\u00a0\ndrying on the lips and it's also not super\u00a0\u00a0\nlike hydrating and slippery i was going to use a\u00a0\nlip gloss but i think i want to leave the lips as\u00a0\u00a0\nis very simple i don't want to add more shine\u00a0\nhere because it's going to take away from the\u00a0\u00a0\neyes but here is the final look what do you\u00a0\nguys think final thoughts on the foundation\u00a0\u00a0\ni am loving the foundation this side was applied\u00a0\nwith a brush this side with a sponge then i went\u00a0\u00a0\nover here with a sponge to eliminate the\u00a0\nbrush strokes both sides look perfect\u00a0\u00a0\nnow when i first applied it i feel like with\u00a0\nthe sponge it looked a little bit more natural\u00a0\u00a0\nand more hydrating more coverage than with\u00a0\nthe brush which is kind of strange i don't\u00a0\u00a0\nknow that's what i've noticed you guys let me know\u00a0\nwhat you guys noticed when i apply this foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nit's a buildable coverage type of foundation\u00a0\nmedium coverage it just looks beautiful healthy\u00a0\u00a0\nhydrating i definitely recommend this giorgio\u00a0\narmani luminous silk foundation i have\u00a0\u00a0\nnormal to dry skin right now i'm very dry it seems\u00a0\nlike especially this area but the foundation did\u00a0\u00a0\nwonders to my face it hydrated my face like i said\u00a0\nit didn't settle into any of my fine lines and it\u00a0\u00a0\nfeels very very very light on my skin it has not\u00a0\nemphasized any of my pores it looks beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nbut again you guys let me know what you think this\u00a0\neyeshadow quad it looks just unbelievable on the\u00a0\u00a0\neyes there's no fallout very easy to blend\u00a0\neasy to use you can create very simple look\u00a0\u00a0\nto very glam very smoky looks with just this\u00a0\nquad this is a cool tone so if you don't like\u00a0\u00a0\ncool tones then probably this palette is not for\u00a0\nyou but i definitely suggest this palette even\u00a0\u00a0\nif you don't like cool tones don't be afraid of\u00a0\nit i think this looks stunning you can just use\u00a0\u00a0\nthis two shades you can just use this and the\u00a0\nglitter all over the eyes or you can just use\u00a0\u00a0\nthis and the matte it creates just a matte look\u00a0\nbut i've used all of them so you guys can see\u00a0\u00a0\nthat there's no fallout and the beautiful look you\u00a0\ncan create with this palette so i hope you guys\u00a0\u00a0\nreally enjoyed this video make sure you comment\u00a0\ndown below and let me know what you guys think of\u00a0\u00a0\nthis giorgio armani luminous silk foundation\u00a0\nand of

There are many great affordable brands out there: The Inkey List, Good Molecules, Geek & Gorgeous or pixi skincare to name a few of my favorites, and if you know how to combine them, you are well on your way to healthy and happy skin.\nHealthy and happy skin does not mean \"flawless\" - whatever that might be. I have been struggling with acne, hyperpigmentation and postinflammatory erythema (PIH and PIE) for most of my adult life, and it took me a while to figure out that gentle is key. I went through a retinol damaged skin barrier, acne flare ups and sun damage until I finally reached my happy place: With Tretinoin, sunscreen and of course a red lipstick!\n\nDisclaimer: \nI am a doctor, so I do have a good understanding of scientific studies, skin and ingredients.This video is not intended to provide diagnosis, treatment or medical advice.

Not heavy, but still\u00a0\u00a0\nfeeling like an oil on my admittedly more oily\u00a0\nskin. The scent is very faint and slightly nutty.\nHow to use Zelens Power D Fortifying\u00a0\n& Restoring Vitamin D Concentrate\u00a0\nApparently it is suitable for morning and night\u00a0\ntime use, but if that works for you probably\u00a0\u00a0\nheavily depends on your skin type. As I said, I\u00a0\nam normal to oily and wouldn\u2019t dream of using it\u00a0\u00a0\nin the mornings. For me it is a night time product\u00a0\nthat goes on either as last step or mixed in with\u00a0\u00a0\nmy moisturizer if I want just a little more oomph.\u00a0\nMy preferred way though is two drops of the oil\u00a0\u00a0\npressed into my face to end my evening routine.\nI am not exaggerating if I say that this is my\u00a0\u00a0\nsecret weapon for flake-free\u00a0\nskin using Tretinoin in winter.\n \u00a0\nIngredients of Zelens Power D Fortifying\u00a0\n& Restoring Vitamin D Concentrate\u00a0\nOther than the Vitamin D I will touch on in\u00a0\na bit, this concentrate contains a bunch of\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent plant oils, Squalane, Aminoacids and\u00a0\nsoothing ingredients like Bisabolol. There are\u00a0\u00a0\nalso Phospholipids, Linoleic and Linolenic Acid\u00a0\nwhich are essential for a healthy skin barrier.\u00a0\nThe Vitamin D is present in form of\u00a0\n7-Dehydrocholesterol, so actually Provitamin D3\u00a0\u00a0\nthat gets converted into Vitamin D\u00a0\nin the skin And, just to be clear,\u00a0\u00a0\nit will not cure any systemic Vitamin D\u00a0\ndeficiencies, you\u2019d need a supplement for that.\u00a0\u00a0\nSo while it doesn\u2019t help with bone\u00a0\ndensity and your immune system,\u00a0\u00a0\nit does have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant\u00a0\nand calming benefits for the skin.\nNow I will be completely honest here: I am\u00a0\nnot sure if the resilience I see in my skin\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen using this during winter is due to the\u00a0\nVitamin D or due to the blend of lipids that\u00a0\u00a0\nsmooth down my skin's outer layer, but\u00a0\nI really don\u2019t care. What I care about\u00a0\u00a0\nis that since I started incorporating this\u00a0\none into my winter skincare routine, my skin\u00a0\u00a0\nnever again was the flakey mess Tretinoin caused\u00a0\nit to be as soon as the temperatures dropped.\nWhich skin types do I recommend it to?\nI really don\u2019t think this one is suited\u00a0\u00a0\nto oily skin types, but if you are normal\u00a0\nand prone to irritation due to Tretinoin,\u00a0\u00a0\nor if your skin is dry and inflamed for any\u00a0\nreason, this could be a game changer. And if you\u00a0\u00a0\nshy away from the price - I get the 10 ml and they\u00a0\nlast me well over 6 months, which is for how long\u00a0\u00a0\nI need it anyway, so while I know it is beyond the\u00a0\nbudget of many, to me it is worth repurchasing.\nWhat is your most expensive product?\u00a0\nTell me in the comments below.\u00a0\nI will link to more videos you might find\u00a0\ninteresting on the screen and add links\u00a0\u00a0\nto my Instagram, blog and Patreon\u00a0\naccount in the description box.\nSee you soon, bye!",

        "transcript_text": "hey everyone welcome back to my\u00a0\nchannel my name is nikki larose\u00a0\u00a0\nand today we're going to do a cool toned soft glam\nso my skin's pretty much prepped but i am going to\u00a0\nthrow on a glowy sunscreen before i do the rest of\u00a0\u00a0\nmy makeup so my finishing step for my skincare is\u00a0\nusing the glow screen from super goop i love using\u00a0\u00a0\nthis under my foundation it gives a beautiful glow\u00a0\nfrom within kind of look next i'll be moving on to\u00a0\u00a0\nmy eye makeup and i'll be using the nars soft\u00a0\nmatte concealer in custard as my eyeshadow base\u00a0\u00a0\nso as you can see i covered my entire eye space\u00a0\nwith that nars concealer i even brought it outside\u00a0\u00a0\ntowards the outer corner of my eye towards my\u00a0\ntemple and then towards the inner part of my nose\u00a0\u00a0\nand that way when i go with my foundation\u00a0\nit's going to blend more seamlessly\nfresh\nbaby\nnext i'm going to set my concealer\u00a0\nthat i use for my eyeshadow base\u00a0\u00a0\nusing the tilbury pressed powder and medium\nsince i do have really oily eyelids\u00a0\ni'm going to reinforce that eyeshadow\u00a0\u00a0\nbase a little bit more with some\u00a0\nloose powder from one size beauty\nto start i'll be using that first color with a\u00a0\nfluffy brush this one's from zoeva it's a 228\u00a0\u00a0\ncrease brush so i'm really taking the time to\u00a0\nblend that first color because this is going\u00a0\u00a0\nto be like the start of this cool tone semi-smoky\u00a0\neye so i really want to make sure that foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nthat i lay down is nice and blended and really\u00a0\nperfect for the rest of the colors to lay on top\nready\nforeign\nbaby\nbaby\ni'm switching to a smaller blending\u00a0\nbrush this one's from mac it's a 217\u00a0\u00a0\nand i'm going to dip into that second matte color\nso i'm keeping this color really tight on the\u00a0\nsecond half of my eye meaning i'm not going all\u00a0\u00a0\nthe way across my eyelid or across my crease\u00a0\ni'm just going about halfway into my crease\u00a0\u00a0\nand i'm focusing that color maintaining\u00a0\nthe depth on the outer portion of my eye\nfresh\nfresh\nswitching to a smaller blending brush\u00a0\nthan the last one now i'm going to dip\u00a0\u00a0\ninto that third color so now with these\u00a0\ndarker shades that i'm dipping into\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm going to start to create a little more of a\u00a0\ncat eye with these shadows which of course is one\u00a0\u00a0\nof my favorite things to do and just kind of focus\u00a0\nit on the outer corner of my eye which you'll see\noh\nready\nready\nso the technique that i'm using is i'm going\u00a0\nreally tight with my brush i'm resting my\u00a0\u00a0\npinky on my face for stability and i'm just\u00a0\nkind of dragging it straight across the outer\u00a0\u00a0\nportion of my lash line almost trying to create\u00a0\nlike a straight line and then blending it out\nnext in the line we're going to take that fourth\u00a0\ncolor in the palette smaller more flat dense brush\u00a0\u00a0\nso now i'm just layering that fourth color\u00a0\nstraight over the last color that we applied\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i switched up my brush so i can get more of a\u00a0\nprecise but still like fluffy blown out effect but\u00a0\u00a0\nsince this brush is smaller it's going to deposit\u00a0\nmore color and make it a little more intense\nfresh\nswitching that brush one more time to an\u00a0\neven smaller flat brush that's still kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof fluffy so we'll be able to blend this\u00a0\nout we're going to dip into that last color\u00a0\u00a0\nbefore we go in and clean up this eyeshadow\nfresh\ngot fresh\nbaby\nso now we're going to clean this up and\u00a0\nturn it into more of a cat eye shape\nfresh\nnext i'm going to tightline my top\u00a0\nlash line with the one size beauty\u00a0\u00a0\npoint made bodacious black eyeliner\nnow i'm grabbing a half lash i have mascara on\u00a0\nalready as i'm sure you've seen because i worked\u00a0\u00a0\nearlier today so i'm just going to add a nice\u00a0\nsimple half lash just to kind of up the ante\nbaby\nmoving on to the makeup forever endless cacao\u00a0\npencil i'll be using this for my bottom lash line\u00a0\u00a0\nand then layering a couple of the\u00a0\nmatte shadows on top got fresh\ngoing back to that small blending brush\nbaby\nfor this cool tone more matte look i want\u00a0\nto keep it pretty much matte but i want to\u00a0\u00a0\nadd just a little hint of a fun sparkle so i'll\u00a0\nbe using the fenty highlighter in my tear ducts\nfresh\nthis iridescent shimmer it's just\u00a0\nso subtle it's so soft it's like a\u00a0\u00a0\npretty little like fairy dust i love just like\u00a0\na touch of it just to kind of offset and balance\u00a0\u00a0\nout that super matte look that we have going on\u00a0\nwith the eyeshadow i just think it's so pretty\u00a0\u00a0\ni got fresh\nfresh\ni got fresh\nmoving on to foundation i'll be using one\u00a0\nof my all-time favorites this is a dior\u00a0\u00a0\nbackstage face and body foundation in 2w\nbaby\ngot fresh\nmoving on to concealer i'll be using the one\u00a0\nsize beauty turn up the base concealer in 2r\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is my personal concealer so i'll be using\u00a0\nit and directly applying it to my under eye area\u00a0\u00a0\ni bought this recently and i've been\u00a0\ntesting out the formula and i love it\u00a0\u00a0\nso i actually use this concealer more\u00a0\nas like a color corrector it has a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nof peach and pink in it so it's great for\u00a0\ncancelling out that dark pigmentation that\u00a0\u00a0\ni have under my eye so this is kind of my first\u00a0\nstep and now i'm going to go in with a lighter\u00a0\u00a0\nbrighter concealer to kind of\u00a0\nhighlight and brighten up that area\ngot fresh\ngrabbing the nars radiant creamy concealer in\u00a0\u00a0\ncanal i'll be layering this on top\u00a0\nof our one size beauty concealer\ni'm also taking that concealer and\u00a0\ndragging it directly down the side\u00a0\u00a0\nof my nose and that's going to give me\u00a0\na really nice natural contoured effect\u00a0\u00a0\nand also i'm bringing it in the inner part\u00a0\nof my eye to highlight and brighten more\nready\ntaking a damp beauty sponge this one's\u00a0\nfrom huda beauty i'm going to start to\u00a0\u00a0\nwork that concealer in and really press it down\nso now i'm going to highlight the bridge of my\u00a0\nnose using a little bit more of that concealer\u00a0\u00a0\nand that same flat brush we used earlier\nand then taking whatever's left over i'm going\u00a0\u00a0\nto just bring a little more\u00a0\nin the center of my forehead\nand then bring a little more of that\u00a0\nand highlighting just above my top lip\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm taking that same damp beauty sponge and\u00a0\nnow i'm going to dip into our loose powder\nand i'm going to work it into the palm of my hand\u00a0\nwhich helps to eliminate any excess product that\u00a0\u00a0\nwe don't want to just fall everywhere and it\u00a0\ngives us a little more control so now onto\u00a0\u00a0\none of my favorite parts i'm going to bake\u00a0\nunder my eye and set the rest of my makeup\nfresh\nbaby\ni got fresh\nfresh\nfreshness\nso before i go with my bronzer to contour just\u00a0\u00a0\nlightly my cheeks i'm gonna go in with my\u00a0\nloose powder i'm gonna start to carve out\nthe reason why i'm smiling a little\u00a0\nbit as i do this is because it gives\u00a0\u00a0\nme more of a guide and it shows me when\u00a0\ni smile where to place that highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\nor where to place that loose powder\u00a0\nso right just underneath my apple\nmoving on to my bronzer i'll be using\u00a0\nhula from benefit i have used this for\u00a0\u00a0\nso many years i love this bronzer this\u00a0\nis probably like my fifth one that i'm on\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm using a fluffy brush because i want the\u00a0\nend result to be really soft more natural if\u00a0\u00a0\ni use more of a dense brush it would go on\u00a0\na little too pigmented for what i want and\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm making sure to be careful not to go below\u00a0\nwhere i have that loose powder for highlighting\u00a0\u00a0\nso you can really see how this helps guide you\u00a0\nin the placement of your bronzer or your contour\u00a0\u00a0\nso taking that same bronzer i'm going\u00a0\nto use that to dust off my baking powder\u00a0\u00a0\nand at the same time add a little\u00a0\nbit of contour to the side of my nose\nnext up i'll be using wonderlust blush from\u00a0\nbuxom cosmetics and i chose this because it\u00a0\u00a0\nis more of a cool toned almost like a mauvy\u00a0\npink which will go great with her eyeshadow\u00a0\u00a0\nusing the same brush that i use for my bronzer\u00a0\nso i'm blending this really close to the rest\u00a0\u00a0\nof my eye makeup and up towards my temple\u00a0\njust give this look a nice cohesive effect\nready\nbring whatever's left over i'm going to sweep\u00a0\nit just across my nose just to tie it all in\u00a0\u00a0\nand a little bit on my forehead i'm going back to\u00a0\nuse the remnants of foundation that's on my brush\ni'm going to pat it on my lips just to cancel\u00a0\nout that pink pigmentation that i have on my lips\u00a0\u00a0\nmy lips are naturally super pink so\u00a0\njust to cancel that out so when we\u00a0\u00a0\nput our lipstick on top it's going to be\u00a0\nmore true to color same idea as putting an\u00a0\u00a0\neyeshadow base on your eyes first so your\u00a0\neyeshadows pop and they're more pigmented\u00a0\u00a0\nand true to color it's the same thing\u00a0\nwith your lips this is a great tip\nmoving on to lip liner i'll be using the nude\u00a0\nenvy lip liner in perfect this is actually one\u00a0\u00a0\nof my friends makeup brands and she's got some\u00a0\nreally beautiful nice natural and neutral colors\ngot fresh\nand then i'm just going to\u00a0\nrub it in with my fingertip\nnext up i'll be using the dose of colors liquid\u00a0\nmatte i love this formula in a matte lipstick\u00a0\u00a0\nit's probably one of my favorites because\u00a0\nit's really comfortable on and it's not like\u00a0\u00a0\ndry and cracky throughout the day using the color\u00a0\nand the color is going to be extra toasty this is\u00a0\u00a0\nnot my product so i'll be taking a little\u00a0\nbit out and applying it with a makeup brush\nfresh\ngot fresh\nand i'm just going to dab the rest in\u00a0\u00a0\nnow i'm just gonna take the makeup off of my\u00a0\nmole one of my biggest pet peeves with makeup is\u00a0\u00a0\nputting too much makeup on top of\u00a0\nmoles so i always like to go in\u00a0\u00a0\nwith a little q-tip and clean that\u00a0\nmakeup off and bring them back out\nand just to add a little more dimension to my\u00a0\nskin i'm going to be adding a cream highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one's from garlactic in moonlight so i'll\u00a0\njust be taking this with my fingertip and dab it\u00a0\u00a0\nonto the bridge of my nose and this is really\u00a0\njust going to bring some more balance to this\u00a0\u00a0\nreally matte look so i like to do just the\u00a0\ntop the very top of the bridge of my nose\u00a0\u00a0\nalmost between my brows but right below it\u00a0\nand then just the tip of my nose so i leave\u00a0\u00a0\nthis center part completely bare i don't\u00a0\nwant to be like a disco ball going down\u00a0\u00a0\nthis just brings some nice balance\u00a0\nto my nose and to my features\nand cream highlighters work so\u00a0\nmuch better and so much easier\u00a0\u00a0\nif you work them into the\u00a0\nskin with your fingertips\u00a0\u00a0\nfinishing step for this tutorial\u00a0\nis using the hourglass veil\u00a0\u00a0\nsoft focus setting spray to set my makeup\nnow i'm just gonna let this dry and that\u00a0\ncompletes our look so here's the finished\u00a0\u00a0\nlook this is my cool toned soft glam this is\u00a0\nsomething different i don't usually go for\u00a0\u00a0\ncool tone shadows or cool tone makeup looks\u00a0\nbut i really have been liking this it's stuff\u00a0\u00a0\nbeing so different for me if you like this cool\u00a0\ntone look don't forget to hit the like button\u00a0\u00a0\nalso don't forget to subscribe to my channel\u00a0\nit really helps me out i have more makeup\u00a0\u00a0\ntutorials and eyeshadow looks over here thanks\u00a0\nso much for

First of all I just\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to say Happy New Year! Happy 2022, I cannot\u00a0\nbelieve we're in the new year already and today\u00a0\u00a0\nby popular demand I'm going to start a series\u00a0\nof mainly drugstore foundation reviews and in\u00a0\u00a0\ntoday's video I'm going to be reviewing this\u00a0\ndrugstore foundation by Milani. It's the 2 in\u00a0\u00a0\n1 Conceal and Perfect foundation. I have used\u00a0\nit before so it's not a first impressions so\u00a0\u00a0\ntherefore I know how it performs on my skin. That\u00a0\nbeing said I'm going to show you how to apply it\u00a0\u00a0\nthen I'm going to do 2 check-ins then at\u00a0\nthe end of the video I'm going to give you\u00a0\u00a0\nmy final thoughts on how I feel this foundation\u00a0\nperforms. The good the bad and the ugly! I'm not\u00a0\u00a0\nsaying it's good or bad or ugly but i'll give you\u00a0\nthe full low down so if you're ready let's begin!\nMy face is moisturized, I'm not using any primer -\u00a0\nI want you to see how it looks without any primer\u00a0\u00a0\nso just skincare is on at the moment. I've got\u00a0\ntwo shades, one is great for the Summertime for\u00a0\u00a0\nme and the other one is just a little bit too\u00a0\nlight possibly now but the shade I wanted was\u00a0\u00a0\nout of stock so we'll just make do. First of\u00a0\nall I want to show you how it actually looks.\nThat's kind of like one pump and I'm using my\u00a0\nReal Techniques Expert Face Brush to apply this\u00a0\u00a0\nso I like to start in the middle actually of\u00a0\nmy face where I have the most pigmentation\u00a0\u00a0\nand then work my way out, don't be afraid to apply\u00a0\nit under your eyes and use it as a concealer.\nI still have a fair amount left on my hand\u00a0\nand let's bring you in a bit closer and see,\u00a0\u00a0\nthat it's a pretty good coverage so this is a\u00a0\nmedium coverage foundation but you can build it\u00a0\u00a0\nup to full coverage. It doesn't feel heavy on the\u00a0\nskin, it still needs a bit more time to dry down\u00a0\u00a0\nstill a little bit tacky. And because this can be\u00a0\nused as a concealer as well it's perfectly fine to\u00a0\u00a0\napply under the eye. What I'm doing is I'm patting\u00a0\n- stippling actually the brush and the foundation\u00a0\u00a0\ninto my skin rather than buffing around because\u00a0\nI don't want to get brush marks, not that this\u00a0\u00a0\nbrush leaves many brush marks but stippling it\u00a0\npressing it into the skin especially on the areas\u00a0\u00a0\nthat need more coverage. I'm going to go away\u00a0\nnow put the rest of my makeup on. I'm going to\u00a0\u00a0\ndo 2 check-ins so you can see how it's held up and\u00a0\nthen I'll give you my final findings and thoughts\u00a0\u00a0\non this and we'll conclude with whether or not\u00a0\nI think that you should go ahead and try it.\nOkay so up close and personal and you can see that\u00a0\nit hasn't accentuated the lines under my eyes,\u00a0\u00a0\nremember I didn't use any primer I just used\u00a0\nskincare and it hasn't actually broken down after\u00a0\u00a0\n5 hours and it hasn't accentuated any of my dry\u00a0\npatches predominantly sort of around my mouth area\u00a0\u00a0\nand nor has it accentuated my pores in fact they\u00a0\nlook quite minimised so really happy with this.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe finish is still very radiant without looking\u00a0\noily or greasy which i'm really pleased about.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe consistency is creamy it's rich but also\u00a0\nit's lightweight so when you put it on your skin\u00a0\u00a0\nyou don't feel like it's heavy or cakey or too\u00a0\nmuch you don't need a huge amount I used a pump\u00a0\u00a0\nif you want more coverage it's\u00a0\nbuildable you can apply it with a sponge\u00a0\u00a0\nor you can use a brush like I did.\u00a0\nI feel that the sponge probably\u00a0\u00a0\ndoesn't give you as much coverage if you're\u00a0\nafter full coverage then go with a brush.\nIt hasn't broken down but you can definitely\u00a0\nsee shine on the skin and also on the sides of\u00a0\u00a0\nmy nose you can see where my glasses were and\u00a0\nit has slightly rubbed off but nothing major.\u00a0\u00a0\nAll in all I think this stood up very well. It\u00a0\nclaims to be long wearing was it long wearing?\u00a0\u00a0\nWell yeah I think for sure it was, I did a 5 hour\u00a0\ncheck-in and then a 10-hour check-in and as far\u00a0\u00a0\nas I'm concerned it still looked pretty amazing.\u00a0\nIt's creamy it's flawless it's lightweight did it\u00a0\u00a0\ncover my imperfections? Yes it did with just\u00a0\none application around the middle of my face\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich has pigmentation, it did a marvellous job,\u00a0\nit felt smooth it felt flawless even without\u00a0\u00a0\nsetting it and also it's water resistant so\u00a0\nthat's a big positive especially um in the warmer\u00a0\u00a0\nmonths - which seem so far away at the moment! But\u00a0\nif you've got an oily skin I definitely recommend\u00a0\u00a0\na setting powder or using a primer first for oily\u00a0\nskin or using a setting spray and I love this NYX\u00a0\u00a0\nsetting spray - again it's affordable\u00a0\nmakeup, it does the job really really well.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd back to the Milani 2 in 1\u00a0\nPerfect and Conceal Foundation,\u00a0\u00a0\nit hasn't got a huge price point, it comes in 29\u00a0\nshades, it's cruelty free and although the formula\u00a0\u00a0\nis rich and creamy it doesn't make your skin\u00a0\nfeel greasy or oily. When I weigh it up against\u00a0\u00a0\nother foundations that I've got and use which cost\u00a0\nmaybe \u00a310 \u00a315 - \u00a320 pounds more than this one,\u00a0\u00a0\nI think why wouldn't I use this?! At the moment\u00a0\nit is my Holy Grail affordable foundation.\u00a0\u00a0\nAm I going to find something better? I hope\u00a0\nso, I'm really excited to try lots of new\u00a0\u00a0\nfoundations and if there's one that you want me\u00a0\nto try, drop it in the comments below! Always on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe lookout for amazing affordable foundations\u00a0\nespecially for dry mature skin and thank you to\u00a0\u00a0\nall my lovely subscribers! Take care everyone\u00a0\nI'll see you in the next video. Bye for now!",

The last foundations I tried out were the wet n wild photo focus, maybelline 24 hr., and for higher end I tried the Marc Jacob&#39;s foundation. For concealer I was using the tart shape tape , I know literally everyone loves that concealer, but on me it looks so thick even if I use a tiny bit. It&#39;s a crime not to prime \u263a I always use primer lol <br>Thank you for the response \ud83d\udda4 <br>One more question...does makeup expire?",

sick over the holidays i got kovid and\u00a0\u00a0\num today's the first day that i have enough\u00a0\nenergy and feel well enough to sit down and\u00a0\u00a0\nfilm so um all the content that i had planned and\u00a0\nscheduled for filming over the holidays um had to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe postponed and so hopefully i can sit down over\u00a0\nthe next couple of days to like get a lot of this\u00a0\u00a0\ncontent and ideas out to you guys including\u00a0\nuh my top beauty favorites of 2021 i was so\u00a0\u00a0\nso looking forward to sharing that with\u00a0\nyou guys hopefully these topics are still\u00a0\u00a0\ninteresting to you and you'll be able to\u00a0\nenjoy it once i get those uploaded today we\u00a0\u00a0\nwill be focusing on natasha denona's mini biba\u00a0\npalette she released this um several weeks ago\u00a0\u00a0\nand i'm going to swatch them swatch this\u00a0\ndo comparisons and kind of demo the palette\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me know what you guys think of the mini biba\u00a0\nif you already have it i don't actually have her\u00a0\u00a0\nwas it meaty size or full sized palette of the\u00a0\nbiba so i don't have any comparisons directly\u00a0\u00a0\nwith that i do know these shadows are brand new\u00a0\nso they are not repeats from the um original biba\u00a0\u00a0\nand this is i guess more of an extension of that\u00a0\npalette so let me quickly read the description on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe website before we move on to swatch it mini\u00a0\nbeba palette um as described here is inspired by\u00a0\u00a0\ntheir best-selling everyday essential 15 pan beba\u00a0\neyeshadow palette extending the concept of an\u00a0\u00a0\nall-neutral palette the shade extension features\u00a0\nfive brand new nude and brown shades with neutral\u00a0\u00a0\nrosy undertones it is perfect to create a variety\u00a0\nof looks for every occasion from daytime looks to\u00a0\u00a0\nevening smoky eyes moving on to the swatches\u00a0\nwe'll first start with bruno deep mahogany brown\nand the shadow does feel very creamy\u00a0\nbut it's not swatching really nice on my\u00a0\u00a0\nwrist going in for a second application well we\u00a0\nwill put it on the lids and put it to the test i\u00a0\u00a0\nstill have a lot of product left on my finger okay\u00a0\ni'm sorry it looks like a mess on my wrist but\u00a0\u00a0\nwe will give it another try on the lid followed\u00a0\nby nude dusty rose and this shade is called\nizzy i think the swatch better then\u00a0\nthere is blaze nude a light rosy nude\nsignature glam natasha denona metallic\u00a0\nand then a light medium dusty coral plush\nand i'm going in for a second\u00a0\napplication i think the swatched okay too\u00a0\u00a0\nlast shade is a medium dusty coral brown wink\nwink swatched beautifully so\u00a0\nthis is only one application\u00a0\u00a0\nall right i'm taking izzy and\u00a0\nplacing that all over the lid\nthen taking bruno and putting\u00a0\nthis onto the outer corner\ndepending on how well it layers on top of this\u00a0\nother shadow here and how easy it is to blend i\u00a0\u00a0\nhave some concerns i if it's easy i'm gonna use\u00a0\nmore of it on the upper lash line but we'll see\ni think it looks fine i think it went on nice\u00a0\nnicely i'm going to diffuse that into the crease\ni'm gonna add a little bit more\ni'm also gonna go in with this flat definer\u00a0\nbrush from sonia g and i want to add\u00a0\u00a0\nthis bruno shade on top of the upper\u00a0\nlash line in a concentrated way\nnext using plush i am adding that right here\ni'm just brightening everything\u00a0\nup and moving the shade lightly\u00a0\u00a0\ntowards the crease and kind\u00a0\nof the middle of the crease\nthen i'm also taking the shade\u00a0\nand kind of lightly dusting it on\u00a0\u00a0\non the outer part of the lid adding some color\nand then going into blaze nude\u00a0\nam putting that right here\nand i'm going to add more\nmmm definitely bright and glam\nand now i'm going to go back in to bruno\u00a0\njust going to deepen this area a bit more\nbecause i want more contrast against\u00a0\num blaze nude nude blaze blaze nude\nand then going back into plush i'm\u00a0\ngoing to add more of it into the crease\nbecause i want blaze nude to be more dramatic and\u00a0\nthat there is more texture built around the shade\nokay so finally i'm going to for\u00a0\nthe sake of the demonstration\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm going to the last shade we haven't used yet\u00a0\nwink and i'm putting that on the lower lash line\nlet me repeat the look on the other eye i'll\u00a0\nput on some mascara then we'll come back to\u00a0\u00a0\nfinish blush and lipstick for blush i'm going\u00a0\nto use plush and see how that looks because\u00a0\u00a0\ndepending on your skin tone i feel like this\u00a0\nis a great blush i mean it's guaranteed to go\u00a0\u00a0\nwith your eyeshadow look the challenge though\u00a0\nis that it's a small pan for your brush size\nand then for lips i want to go with something\u00a0\nnatasha denona initially but then because this\u00a0\u00a0\nis such a coral look i was really inspired to\u00a0\ntake out chanel's rouge cocoa flash in the shade\u00a0\u00a0\nsunbeam they came out with this last summer\u00a0\nand i think this would be a really good match\nand for highlight i am taking natasha denona's\u00a0\nglam face palette in light i'm going to use\u00a0\u00a0\nthis here um let's see since this is kind of like\u00a0\na creamy formulation perfect i'm going to use\u00a0\u00a0\nthis brush here um this is koyuto's bp\u00a0\ncollection and this is undyed goat hair\u00a0\u00a0\ni think it's brush number 16 maybe\u00a0\n14. i'll have the information below\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i i really really like coodo\u00a0\nbrushes especially their face brushes\nthis is the finished look and i actually\u00a0\nreally like how everything turned out\u00a0\u00a0\ni do enjoy coral shades shades with a coral\u00a0\nundertone so i think this is right up my alley\u00a0\u00a0\nand probably subconsciously i was thinking coral\u00a0\npinkish because of my top today um what i didn't\u00a0\u00a0\nrealize when i first saw the palette is that\u00a0\nthis one is corally but this one also has like\u00a0\u00a0\na coral undertone i mean even this metallic shade\u00a0\nhere there's a bit of a coral undertone to it and\u00a0\u00a0\nalso um myself i have hooded eyes and to create a\u00a0\nclassic halo look you gotta like place the shadows\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit differently you know do some tricks\u00a0\nto give that dimension that kind of illusion\u00a0\u00a0\nand i feel like i didn't even need to you know\u00a0\nuse concealer to achieve what i have because this\u00a0\u00a0\nshade here is so bright and contrasted against you\u00a0\nknow these nude shades these darker shades it just\u00a0\u00a0\ngave me the kind of look i was really\u00a0\nlooking for and so i was very pleasantly\u00a0\u00a0\nsurprised and i think it worked well this is\u00a0\na halo eye look that i would say is kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nlow-key in terms of effort so really really\u00a0\nenjoy this palette um about the shade here\u00a0\u00a0\nit went on fine and it went on very concentrated\u00a0\nbut blending out is not as easy as some of her\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know previous deeper uh matte shadows um i\u00a0\nthink you know i didn't have an issue with it\u00a0\u00a0\nit just took a little bit more blending but that's\u00a0\njust something to be aware of and it definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nthis swatch is not representative maybe it's a\u00a0\nlittle bit tackier than um some of her deeper like\u00a0\u00a0\nher other deeper mattes but this is definitely not\u00a0\nrepresentative i think it looks you know fine the\u00a0\u00a0\nway it is and i didn't really have much fallout\u00a0\neither from it that's usually the danger with\u00a0\u00a0\nthe deep matte shade is that like oh if you're\u00a0\ngonna fall out it can get really messy but no i\u00a0\u00a0\ndidn't have any fallout so yeah really really like\u00a0\nthis palette um now i'm going to go ahead and do\u00a0\u00a0\nsome comparisons the first two shades i'm going to\u00a0\ntake out is actually from her trio chrome palette\u00a0\u00a0\nthese two here i think has some similarities\u00a0\nto the two shades the two lighter mattes\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom mini biba and i know it's not going to be\u00a0\nthe same but i think like just from looking at it\u00a0\u00a0\nthey look most similar i recently rediscovered\u00a0\nher trio chrome palette i wear these shades to\u00a0\u00a0\ncreate a look for like christmas eve dinner and i\u00a0\nloved it and it made me realize that i do not have\u00a0\u00a0\num mattes in my collection that are these kind\u00a0\nof shades i mean purple is probably you know i\u00a0\u00a0\nhave the most in terms of mattes i have the most\u00a0\nin purple and you know these kind of like lavender\u00a0\u00a0\nlilac type variances but these still kind of\u00a0\nstand out on their own i think they're beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nso so yeah i've been rediscovering\u00a0\nthis palette and really enjoying it\u00a0\u00a0\nso these two shades i have here um\u00a0\nthis is diatonic and this is garmon\ndiatonic and garmon\nnot the same diatonic is brighter but it is\u00a0\ndefinitely a coral shade and then garmon is pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nsimilar to this shade here which is izzy and i\u00a0\nwould say this is warmer and this is cooler and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen from the mini retro palette i'd like to take\u00a0\nindustrial because it is a pinky mauvy matte shade\ni mean these are quite similar i feel like they\u00a0\ncan just mix and match really easily and you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan still create a cohesive look with them then\u00a0\nfrom the zendo palette i'd like to take a look\u00a0\u00a0\nat the shade which is uncovered a dusty coral\u00a0\nand also this one here is bear pastel pink\nthis dusty coral is very similar to izzy\nit's a touch more coral pinky than it is kind\u00a0\nof like coral brownish very similar though from\u00a0\u00a0\nher glam face palette in light i'm gonna take\u00a0\nthese two matte shades um transition and crease\u00a0\u00a0\nthese are instructional names they're mostly\u00a0\ngoing to be um more beigey and brown leaning\nwell i guess this one's pink\nyeah they're so similar like they have the\u00a0\nsame vibes maybe a touch cooler these two\u00a0\u00a0\nthan what's up here my final thoughts um\u00a0\nreally like this mini did not expect it\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know had some hesitation with\u00a0\nbruno in the beginning but now that\u00a0\u00a0\nthe look is put together i really\u00a0\ndidn't have any issues or struggled\u00a0\u00a0\nit's just it just doesn't blend out as easily\u00a0\nas some of her other you know dark matte shadows\u00a0\u00a0\nif i were to compare what's on here to what's\u00a0\non the glam face palette for both light and dark\u00a0\u00a0\ni would say i prefer the shadows on here and i\u00a0\nthink it just has to do with they're more they're\u00a0\u00a0\nneutral just like what's found here but um it's\u00a0\nmore coral undertone and i tend to enjoy that more\u00a0\u00a0\nnow if you have the zendo mini zendo or mini\u00a0\nretro i do think this palette is different enough\nthat if you if you this catches your attention i\u00a0\nthink you definitely have room to add and still\u00a0\u00a0\nget different looks i feel like this is kind of\u00a0\nthe sweet spot because you've got two palettes\u00a0\u00a0\nhere that have kind of corals and pinks but\u00a0\num the looks you create are quite different\u00a0\u00a0\nand even though this is more coral leaning and\u00a0\nyou could say like yeah it's kind of pink but\u00a0\u00a0\nit's also warmer than these two so this\u00a0\nalso has a place and you can create looks\u00a0\u00a0\nthat are really different from these two\u00a0\nthe third mini palette natasha denona has\u00a0\u00a0\nis the mini love and mini love is undeniably\u00a0\npink and uh what is it hot pink fusion type uh\u00a0\u00a0\nshadows and undertones so that one's going to\u00a0\nbe quite different too this is the mini love\nand let's hold it up with the others\nsimilar vibes but really not the same not the same\u00a0\nwell thank you guys for watching um miss you guys\u00a0\u00a0\nso hopefully i can come back with\u00a0\nanother video very soon after this\u00a0\u00a0\num yeah hope you guys are staying healthy\u00a0\nand had a great holiday see you very soon bye",

skin awaken five in one concealer\ni'm using the shade 75 and this is a\u00a0\u00a0\nvery close match to my skin complexion\u00a0\nso i'm just using it to conceal\nand i'm going to blend that out\nso i'm gonna contour using the fenty\u00a0\nbeauty matchsticks in the shade espresso\nlooks so crazy\nlet's get rid of that double double chin action\ni haven't used this one in a minute\nthis is the rare beauty foundation\u00a0\nin the shade 440c but um\nthat might be too light\ni want to try this rare beauty concealer\u00a0\nso this one is in the shade 420 in\noh i like this applicator\nand we'll put a little bit just a little\u00a0\nbit right there okay and now we blend\ni'm just going to take a regular foundation\u00a0\nbrush and blend everything together\nmy skin looks so good it's\u00a0\ngiving god's favorite right now\nall right i'm gonna start underneath\u00a0\nmy eyes i'm using beauty bakery's\u00a0\u00a0\nflower powder in the shade oats\nme\nthat powder is so bright okay let's\u00a0\nsee let's just dust that powder away\noh\nso i'm gonna bronze real quick before i\u00a0\nspray some setting spray so the bronzer\u00a0\u00a0\nthat i'm using is nars bronzer in the shade casino\ni love when my face comes out good it's like it's\u00a0\ngonna be a good day y'all i'm in a good mood today\u00a0\u00a0\nif you can't already tell i'm just gonna\u00a0\nput a little bit of bronzer in this area\u00a0\u00a0\nall right i'm going to spray setting spray i'm\u00a0\nusing the milk hydro grip and set refresh spray\nfor blush i'm going to use an old favorite this\u00a0\nis whole lot of love by mac pigment is there\ncan we just\ntalk about where\ni'm using this nars larger than life liner\u00a0\nit's just a black eyeliner pencil and\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm just gonna line the top lash line\u00a0\u00a0\nand then i don't i'm not really being precise\u00a0\nwith this because i'm gonna blend it out\nor not blend it out sorry smoke it out\ni'm going to take like a flat\u00a0\nsmudge brush and just smudge\nso i like layering my blushes lately so i'm gonna\u00a0\ngo on top of the blush that i already used and use\u00a0\u00a0\nthis nars orgasm x blush because i don't want\u00a0\nto put on any highlight so this is just going\u00a0\u00a0\nto add that extra glow on top i don't know if\u00a0\nyou guys can really see it but it looks so good\ni'm going back into the nars bronzer and i'm\u00a0\njust dusting that along my lower lash line\nfor mascara i'm just using\u00a0\nthis kush mascara by milk\nall right now on to the lips we're going to be\u00a0\nusing these three shades from revlon's color stay\u00a0\u00a0\nmatte light crayon and shout out to revlon\u00a0\nfor partnering with me on today's video\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is their newest lip product it is a matte\u00a0\nlip crayon but it does not dry out the lips\u00a0\u00a0\ni've actually tried them twice before even doing\u00a0\nthis video but what i like about this and one of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe reasons why i kind of strayed away from using\u00a0\nmatte lip products i found that it really really\u00a0\u00a0\ndried out my lips and this does not do that i did\u00a0\napply a lip mask before starting so that my lips\u00a0\u00a0\nwould like soak up the moisture and not dry out\u00a0\nwith using a matte lip product and not applying\u00a0\u00a0\nany gloss on top i really do like the way that\u00a0\nthese glide on they are super creamy and even\u00a0\u00a0\nwith drinking out of a straw my lipstick did\u00a0\nnot rub off which is in my book a plus we're\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna use these three shades today like i said\u00a0\ni'm gonna start with the shade on cloud wine\u00a0\u00a0\nand it's this very deep plum these are retractable\u00a0\nso you can twist it up you get a pretty decent\u00a0\u00a0\namount of product and like i said i've already\u00a0\nused these twice before i brought you guys\u00a0\u00a0\nin so that you can really see what i'm doing so\u00a0\nfirst i'm just gonna take and line my top lip\nand then press my lips together\nnow with the shade sky high i'm just going to\u00a0\ntake and go along where i already filled in\nfor the final shade mile high you're just\u00a0\ngoing to fill in the whole bottom lip with this\nand now just go back in with sky\u00a0\nhigh and do a little bit of blending\u00a0\u00a0\nand this will help to create a seamless\u00a0\ntransition between the dark plum and the pink\nwow that's so pretty we went from\u00a0\ncoloring in books to coloring on our faces\nokay so it's safe to say i'm obsessed with this\u00a0\nlip it's so pretty pink is just my color though\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know i'm gonna get ready ahead to\u00a0\ndinner i don't have to worry about my lips\u00a0\u00a0\nsmearing and smudging all over the place okay so\u00a0\ni'm back from dinner and i just wanted to show\u00a0\u00a0\nyou guys this lip does not budge you guys i did\u00a0\nnot touch up not one time and it still looks good\u00a0\u00a0\nso 10 out of 10 in my book okay revlon did a thing\u00a0\nbut anyway i hope you guys enjoyed hanging out\u00a0\u00a0\nwith me in today's video don't forget to like this\u00a0\nvideo subscribe to my channel and turn on the post\u00a0\u00a0\nnotifications so you don't miss any of my future\u00a0\nuploads leave me some comments down in the comment\u00a0\u00a0\nsection below and let me know would you guys wear\u00a0\nthis lip color or what are your thoughts on this\u00a0\u00a0\nlook thank you again to revlon for partnering\u00a0\nwith me in today's video and thank you

        "transcript_text": "hi guys welcome back today i'm doing a video\u00a0\nteaching you how to get this clean polished\u00a0\u00a0\nflawless makeup look so elevated and expensive so\u00a0\nhope you enjoy this look and another note this is\u00a0\u00a0\nall using products that i've packed on my trip to\u00a0\naustralia so i've got a very small kind of like\u00a0\u00a0\nbag very small bag this is a lot\u00a0\ni know for the everyday person but\u00a0\u00a0\nthe products that i'm using are products that i\u00a0\nreally love lately because i packed them to come\u00a0\u00a0\nto australia with as you can see everything\u00a0\nlooks great in my opinion so if you want to\u00a0\u00a0\nsee how i did it and what i used keep watching\u00a0\nstart out with a primer and i've been loving the\u00a0\u00a0\nforever skin veil from dior gives correction\u00a0\nprotection and illumination with some sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0\nthen onto foundation and this is the\u00a0\nclinique one the even better glow light\u00a0\u00a0\nreflecting makeup so it's a really glowy look\u00a0\nand i really love this one is the shade cn40\nso i'm just rubbing that in with a foundation\u00a0\nbrush kind of getting it all over down the neck\nwe look like a mannequin right\u00a0\nnow but we're gonna fix it\u00a0\u00a0\nand then wait till it's semi-set then use a\u00a0\nsetting mist and a sponge the sponge is already\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit damp but i'm gonna drench it with the\u00a0\nsetting mist so the foundation's on pretty thick\u00a0\u00a0\nright now then i'm going to dab the foundation\u00a0\ninto my face using this sponge and setting spray\nso we're essentially pressing\u00a0\nin the mist on top and working\u00a0\u00a0\nit into the upper layers of that foundation\ni also find that this hack helps prevent\u00a0\nwasting foundation because if i blend it\u00a0\u00a0\nout with the sponge it's more likely to be\u00a0\nsoaked up into the sponge so if you're just\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of patting it out when it's already\u00a0\nbeen spread you know i know that it's just\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of working it in the perfect amount without\u00a0\nwasting too much product and you can still get\u00a0\u00a0\nthat full flawless finish okay so that is on\u00a0\nlet's go into eyebrows a tinted brow gel so just\u00a0\u00a0\none step for eyebrows i'm not going to pencil\u00a0\nin because i don't want the pencil on my skin\u00a0\u00a0\nif you just put brow gel on it's a much more\u00a0\nnatural finish obviously than if you were to draw\u00a0\u00a0\non the skin naturally we don't have our eyebrows\u00a0\non our skin they're coming out of our skin so\u00a0\u00a0\nthe way that this works is it just coats the\u00a0\nbrow hairs rather than coating the skin and to\u00a0\u00a0\nreally make the brow hairs themselves thicker\u00a0\ni go backwards and forwards backwards forwards\u00a0\u00a0\nonce i've done that a few times i'll then use\u00a0\nthe brush to manipulate where they're sitting\ntake a concealer this is the secret camouflage\u00a0\nthey have a correcting side and a brightening\u00a0\u00a0\nside i'll take the brightening side it's just\u00a0\nthat it has a little bit of like shimmery stuff\u00a0\u00a0\nin it and just go right up under the brow a\u00a0\nlittle bit here in the inner corner yeah then\u00a0\u00a0\nwith a concealer brush just making sure that it\u00a0\nlooks nice and sharp there patting that in nicely\nand also coming from the\ntop to make it more natural on the inner part\u00a0\nso you don't want it to be too harsh in there\u00a0\u00a0\ni usually take my sponge on my brush and just\u00a0\nmake sure that it kind of fades then a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nof black pencil just right on the lash line just\u00a0\nthickening up and darkening the roots of my lashes\u00a0\u00a0\nthen if anything just a tiny little lift at the\u00a0\nend like that and this one's the makeup forever\u00a0\u00a0\nartist color pencil then a little bit of mascara\u00a0\nfocusing on the roots of the lashes and winging\u00a0\u00a0\nit out then with a clean spoolie coming from above\u00a0\njust to help separate and spread out the mascara\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit without putting too much on it's\u00a0\nimportant to go back in with your concealer in\u00a0\u00a0\ncase you got any mascara anywhere because for it\u00a0\nto be a clean look everything needs to be in its\u00a0\u00a0\nplace now with a skin tone powder i'm going to\u00a0\nput that over my eyelids too so that there's no\u00a0\u00a0\ncreasing or anything like that because there was\u00a0\na little bit of concealer and foundation there\u00a0\u00a0\nnow with another lighter powder i'm gonna put\u00a0\nthat under my eyes just patting first not dragging\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause if the foundation is tacky you know when\u00a0\nyou're first putting it on i just like to pat\u00a0\u00a0\nand then swipe once the powder is on because\u00a0\nthen there won't be any dragging or like\u00a0\u00a0\nmessing it up more powder in the high\u00a0\npoints of the face so like here here\nchin\nand then with whatever's left on your\u00a0\nbrush you can soften it out all over\nonce you've done powder it's important to go\u00a0\nback with your brow gel just to check that\u00a0\u00a0\neverything's in the right spot because\u00a0\nit kind of moved the hairs a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nthen with a highlighter i'm gonna put that on the\u00a0\ninner corner of my eye now just a little bit of\u00a0\u00a0\nbronzer on the perimeters of the face just kind\u00a0\nof in that c shape so that i'm not all one tone\u00a0\u00a0\nand that foundation is quite lightweight i\u00a0\njust want to add a little bit of dimension\njust a small amount of blush and i'm choosing like\u00a0\na bright pink maybe mixing some with the powder\u00a0\u00a0\njust so that it's really\u00a0\nnatural and i'm gonna smile\u00a0\u00a0\nfind the top part of the apples of my\u00a0\ncheeks and then sweep it up right there\nnot like swirling it which\u00a0\ni mean do i mean jelly bean\nnow that the skin is all done before\u00a0\ni'm onto lips i'm just gonna put a\u00a0\u00a0\nvery small amount of mascara onto the lower lashes\nnow i'm just taking my sponge\u00a0\nit's sort of dried a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i'm gonna pat that over to\u00a0\nmake sure everything is blended\u00a0\u00a0\nmake sure you're sharpening your pencils so that\u00a0\nyou've got a really nice point to work with i\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't want any like hazy lines or anything in this\u00a0\nso make sure your line is really nice and sharp\nit's much more clean and polished\u00a0\nand one of my favorite lip glosses\u00a0\u00a0\nlip maximizer collagen active from dior\nand the original one is like a baby pink color and\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one's more nude but really\u00a0\nthey're pretty much sheer anyways\nnow when it comes to my hair get a hair mascara\u00a0\nthis one is the hair and brow pomade clear\u00a0\u00a0\ncoat from elf and jen atkin and make sure\u00a0\nthat's really slick and stays behind my ear\nbecause i have a big forehead i also really\u00a0\nlike to kind of bring it down a little bit\nnow\nnow very last i think now that i'm looking at\u00a0\nmyself in the mirror here i want to take my\u00a0\u00a0\nconcealer the camouflage one just pop that here\u00a0\ni think it's because my baby's still not sleeping\u00a0\u00a0\novernight but i just find that i\u00a0\nhave those bags there that i want\u00a0\u00a0\nto conceal and maybe just using my\u00a0\nlittle finger here i'll work that in\nthat finishes my clean flawless look and up\u00a0\nclose the skin is just so polished and perfect\nthe way the light reflects\u00a0\noff my skin is so ethereal\nbut it still looks and feels real you know\u00a0\nso i really love this technique it stays\u00a0\u00a0\nfor a really nice long time makes\u00a0\nyour skin look so fresh and plump\u00a0\u00a0\nand it stays great that's it hope you guys\u00a0\nenjoyed the video and i'll see you later bye\nyou",

        "transcript_text": "Hey guys, it\u2019s me Aego here, Hi\nHello.\nToday, I'm gonna take some time to do my makeup with the products that\u00a0Heiley and I\u2019ve reviewed this month.\nI\u2019ll be using the products that I took a liking to as I was reviewing them.\nSo first I\u2019ll start with the skin care.\nFor the skin care products, I\u2019ve brought The Lab By Blanc Doux\u2019s Oligo Hyaluronic Acid\u00a05000 Toner\nand HolikaHolika\u2019s GOOD CERA Super Ceramide Cream which I had reviewed this month.\nThe Lab By Blanc doux\u2019s Oligo Hyaluronic Acid 5000 Toner has watery a formulation,\nwith a light\u00a0application and finish that I really liked.\nWhile I also liked Tonymoly\u2019s Wonder Ceramide\u00a0Mochi Toner Pad,\nsince my skin is not extremely dry type,\nThe Lab By Blanc Doux\u2019s product\u00a0is moderately moist and suited me well.\nEven when applying it on once more after\u00a0having already wiping it along my skin texture once,\nit doesn\u2019t feel heavy at\u00a0all, and just left my skin feeling moist.\nIf you want sufficient moisture from\u00a0a toner,\nI recommend applying it on in multiple layers after you wipe your skin\u00a0with it once,\nor use it as a toner pack before moving on to the next skin care product.\nAfter tidying up the texture of my skin with the toner,\nI\u2019ll lightly moisturize my\u00a0skin and then I\u2019ll move on to apply a cream.\nWhen I first tried using HolikaHolika\u2019s GOOD CERA\u00a0Super Ceramide Cream I had expected that it would feel stuffy and heavy,\nbut I took a real liking\u00a0to it because of how light and moist it was.\nHaving oily dehydrated skin, the cream\u00a0didn't feel stuffy for me, and I found it sufficiently light and moist for my skin.\nIt does get stuffy over time when I apply on too much, so I would only apply it in small amounts.\nAnd since my cheeks feel a bit drier compared to other areas,\nI would\u00a0normally apply on one more layer.\nI think this would be best for people with\u00a0dry skin to apply on small amounts in layers than to put on a lot at once like me.\nLike this, I\u2019m done with my quick and simple skin care routine, and now I\u2019ll move on to my base makeup.\u00a0\nHeiley Ssaem reviewed base products\u00a0from two brands this month.\nAnd among them, is a product from Hince.\nSince\u00a0I\u2019ve been very curious about their products\u00a0myself, I tried using the one from Hince.\nI went with the one for No.24 shade.\nI was really taken back with how light and\u00a0moist this foundation was when I first tried it.\nIt feels like I\u2019m applying on a lotion, and\u00a0I can feel how it sticks tightly to my skin.\nThe foundation also seems to have\u00a0a slightly semi-matte finish.\nI used the brush that came with the\u00a0Hince Foundation set to apply it on.\nThe combination with the brush\u00a0seemed to be better than I expected, but it didn't seem to provide any coverage.\nI think this is probably a foundation that\u2019s just\u00a0for creating beautiful and clean looking skin.\nI usually use shade #23, but the #24\u00a0from Hince is said to be okay as well.\nI used the brush to apply this foundation, but when I tried it with my fingers before,\nI felt that it would get cakey if I were\u00a0a bit heavy handed with my skin care.\nSo, if you are going to use this\u00a0foundation, it would be good to keep this point in mind when using it.\nLike this, after my base makeup, I will now move on to do the eye makeup.\nFor my eyes, I used Laka's New Level Eyeshadow Palette which was reviewed by Heiley Ssaem.\nOf the three palettes in total, I used No. 3 Outlook.\nI chose this palette because\u00a0I tend to use brown colors most often.\nI really like its composition of\u00a0variable base, point, and glitter colors.\nAnd the design is quite trendy and pretty.\nFirst, as a base, I applied the 7th color Ginger, on to my eyelids\u00a0and on the entire underline.\nNext, I applied the slightly darker\u00a0No.6 Deep Beige, on the eyelids\u00a0and underline to give some shade.\nNext, I applied No.5 Warm Brown from the corners of the eyes to add depth, and\u00a0then apply a thin layer all over the underline.\u00a0\nThen, I lightly swept No.2 Ash Orange over my eyelids.\u00a0\nAnd after doing my eyeline and mascara,\nI used a thin brush to apply No. 8 Shine Nude to the front of the eyes.\nAnd next, I drew the eyebrow with the darkest color, No. 5 Warm\u00a0Brown, to complete my eye makeup.\u00a0\nand I also used No.7 and No.6 to give some shading on the side of my nose.\nThen I gave some highlighter with No.8.\nLike this, after having done my eye makeup with\u00a0the eyeshadows, and applied on my eyeliner, mascara, eyebrow, shading and highlighter, I'll apply on a blush.\nI didn't review the blush products this month, but I used this product as a blusher\u00a0since I thought it\u2019s also good as a blusher.\nI used Mos\u2019s Air Matte Rouge Lipstick.\nAlthough this is a matte lipstick, it has a moist application and good adhesion, so\u00a0\nI think it would look pretty as a blush as well.\nThere are of a total of 8 colors that all seem to\u00a0feel natural when applied lightly,\nso I think you can easily choose and use the color you want.\nI applied a bit of the lipstick on my ring finger,\nthen I started applying\u00a0it to my cheekbones first.\nI extended the range of\u00a0the blush by tapping it out.\nI applied it as if it\u2019s going\u00a0upwards to the temple area.\nNow, as for my lips, I used Amuse's Dew Tint.\nI used 2 colors of Amuse's Dew Tint. No.6 and No.12\nI first applied a very thin layer\u00a0of No.6 as my base\nby making it look as if it was smeared in an over lip.\nAnd then applied No.12 only on the inside of the lips to make them look plump and pretty.\nAnd there you have it!\nMy [Series of the Month] makeup is done using the products\u00a0we\u2019ve reviewed this month.\nWe\u2019ll be releasing a [Series of the Month] video\u00a0every month with the release of our new content.\u00a0\nSince this is the first video of this\u00a0series, I went ahead by using the\u00a0products Heiley Ssaem and I reviewed this month.\nWith the start of the new year, we also started this kind of fun content for the first time.\nI wonder what kind of content we\u2019ll be seeing in the series of the month release next month.\nSo my video is till here,\nThank you for watching my video today\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\nDon\u2019t forget to subscribe\u25b6\ufe0f\nPress the like buttons\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\nAnd please leave some comments for me\ud83d\udc8c\nI\u2019ll see you guys next time.\nBYE BYE",

We will eventually start hosting give away events as well with hopes to grow the community. <br>While it&#39;s unsure when, I do believe that Joohky will eventually re-open their store in the future, but for the time being our site / app will be focusing on pushing out providing review articles and becoming a beauty community. <br>I hope to also be able to see you on our community site as well ^_^."

is\u00a0\nthe all amethyst palette i bought this from ulta\u00a0\u00a0\ni know i'm in the us now i can say that i\u00a0\nbought it from ulta and i did and i honestly\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen i opened this palette i was smitten by how\u00a0\nthis looks so i'm actually going to do two looks\u00a0\u00a0\ni know who am i we're going to do a first and a\u00a0\nsecond impression and i'm going to let you know\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat i think about the palette obviously\u00a0\nlet's show you some swatches as well and\u00a0\u00a0\nif you haven't been here before if this is your\u00a0\nfirst video here hello my name is andy i am such\u00a0\u00a0\na lover of beauty makeup i love everything beauty\u00a0\nmakeup related i just love playing with makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nfinding new stuff playing with color having a\u00a0\nlot of fun and if you want to see more stuff\u00a0\u00a0\nlike that on your timeline don't forget\u00a0\nto subscribe because i upload well i don't\u00a0\u00a0\nhave a set schedule right now but i do upload\u00a0\nquite a lot of videos because i love youtube\nthis palette comes in a box that looks like\u00a0\nthe palette and back sir back in front looks\u00a0\u00a0\npretty much the same it is called the all\u00a0\namethyst palette i don't know if this has any\u00a0\u00a0\nno there's no like pigment or glitter warnings\u00a0\nin this one this does not have any press glitters\u00a0\u00a0\nthe packaging is stunning and this palette looks\u00a0\nbeautiful this is a cardboard packaging it has\u00a0\u00a0\nlike these race details it has some metallic\u00a0\ndetails it opens up there's no mirror inside\u00a0\u00a0\nbut the inside is stunning it's just i don't\u00a0\nknow i'm just very very impressed by this\u00a0\u00a0\ni personally do not recognize any of these names\u00a0\nfrom former palace but if you see anything do let\u00a0\u00a0\nme know if there's anything here that you're\u00a0\nlike hey i've seen this before maybe i should\u00a0\u00a0\ngrab the purple palettes from colourpop you\u00a0\nknow what i will just pop up some pictures\u00a0\u00a0\nhere showing you some comparisons to other nine\u00a0\npen palettes that are purple from colourpop\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause i know i have at least two just so you\u00a0\ncan see how they look this is the pan size that\u00a0\u00a0\nis slightly bigger than the pan size that are in\u00a0\nthe plastic um palettes and they also have other\u00a0\u00a0\ncardboard nine pen palettes that have small like\u00a0\ni don't know why they're not sticking to the theme\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i like this one i like how it looks i\u00a0\ndo think though that it's the same amount\u00a0\u00a0\nof products inside these pants as the smaller\u00a0\nones they're probably just a little bit more\u00a0\u00a0\nshallow these palettes are very sleek and nice\u00a0\nso i bought this like i said on ulta for 14 i\u00a0\u00a0\nwill link it down below and yeah let's just again\u00a0\ni want to do two looks i want to start with doing\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat do i want to start with doing i kind\u00a0\nof want to do one that is playing a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit with this taupey shade i'm also wearing the\u00a0\nnew lipstick by anastasia this is butterscotch\u00a0\u00a0\nand i'm having the lip liner as well i will\u00a0\nleave a link to that as well first impression\u00a0\u00a0\nvery very very very very impressed this lip\u00a0\nliner formula could become a favorite i'm\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely getting another color that's just a\u00a0\nfirst impression i want to do something that's\u00a0\u00a0\nvery purple but i want to do something that's\u00a0\na little bit more on the muted purple side so\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm going to start with the muted purple side\u00a0\nand i am gonna end with the very purple one so\u00a0\u00a0\nlet's zoom in and let's begin i am so excited\u00a0\nyeah i think i'm gonna start with this one\u00a0\u00a0\nthe taupey one over here it's called fist or\u00a0\nthat i don't understand all of these puns but\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm doing the best i can that's very very\u00a0\npigmented it's definitely like a plum leaning\u00a0\u00a0\ntaupe i didn't set my primer so it is\u00a0\na little bit sticky so there might be\u00a0\u00a0\num it might be looking a little bit weird\u00a0\nbefore it looks good let me put it like that\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i'm gonna put this in the crease and make\u00a0\nthis as wow that is really pigmented i make\u00a0\u00a0\nthat as opaque as possible maybe i don't even need\u00a0\nto deepen this up that is beautiful look at that\u00a0\u00a0\ngo colourpop but yeah i'm just going to build this\u00a0\nup in the crease and i'm gonna use something that\u00a0\u00a0\nhas like like this just a small brush that has no\u00a0\nadditional product and i'm gonna blend the edge\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is a very good tip if you like just like\u00a0\nme like working with shadows on a more sticky\u00a0\u00a0\nbase just put them where you want them and then\u00a0\nyou'll go in with a brush that doesn't have any\u00a0\u00a0\nadditional product and you will start blending\u00a0\nit out that is how i get my shadows to be as\u00a0\u00a0\nopaque as i like them to be and i go back and\u00a0\nforth a bit and with time it ends up looking\u00a0\u00a0\nlike something that i can get on board with i\u00a0\ndon't think i need to i don't think i need to\u00a0\u00a0\ndeepen this up i think i'm just gonna do one\u00a0\ncolor in the crease what a beautiful color\u00a0\u00a0\nthat is stunning okay so i will say this is\u00a0\na little hard to blend but i think that might\u00a0\u00a0\nbe the primer so i'm gonna use another primer\u00a0\nnext time because this primer is maybe a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit more sticky than these shadows enjoy so\u00a0\nto speak i'm going to use this one that's\u00a0\u00a0\ncalled try trigonal trigonal is it called that\u00a0\ntrigonal it is like a matte with shimmer in\u00a0\u00a0\nit and i am going to use that on my lid uh i\u00a0\nam oh that is so pretty yeah this like dusty\u00a0\u00a0\nlavender cool tone it has some shimmer in\u00a0\nit i really like that i'm gonna put that\non my lid and up here\nthat is i really like that so far i'm only using\u00a0\ntwo shades and i feel like this is coming together\u00a0\u00a0\npretty pretty good i'm gonna use some more\u00a0\npurples on my lower lash line to make this\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit more purple but i'm really liking\u00a0\nthis i'm just gonna merge these two a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\npersonally i really like how that is looking\u00a0\ni think that that looks really pretty\u00a0\u00a0\ni really like that okay i am gonna use this one\u00a0\nthe purple and i think i'm gonna use maybe like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shimmer and this like here this like\u00a0\nduochrome shade as well i think i'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nuse those under my eyes so let me find a good\u00a0\nbrush also i call crystal crazy and i'll start\u00a0\u00a0\nwith just applying that a little bit under\u00a0\nmy eyes and then i'll go in with the shimmers\u00a0\u00a0\ni think this little brush from game beauty is\u00a0\ngoing to be perfect this is the e05 and i'm\u00a0\u00a0\ntrying out these new game beauty brushes so let me\u00a0\nsee this is sunbird i think i'm gonna spray it oh\u00a0\u00a0\ni think i'm gonna spray it just to make sure\u00a0\nthat i get the opacity that i want i always\u00a0\u00a0\nspray my shimmer so this isn't something new i\u00a0\nput that on like two thirds of the lower lash line\u00a0\u00a0\ni think i'm gonna put it a little bit lower\u00a0\ndown shimmers on the lower lash line is not kind\u00a0\u00a0\nto your like under eye wrinkles but listen\u00a0\nit is what it is i'm also gonna use the\u00a0\u00a0\nlighter one that's called brilliant which is\u00a0\nthat like duochrome purple i'm gonna spray that\u00a0\u00a0\nas well and we can see if we can put that in the\u00a0\ninner corner oh yeah that's that's really nice\nwow okay i'm really liking that\nokay i think this is gonna be the finished look\u00a0\nit is a little patchy out here but don't look too\u00a0\u00a0\nclose to that i think that might be the primer\u00a0\nto be honest because i did have some problems\u00a0\u00a0\nwith this primer normally i like this primer but\u00a0\ndidn't work perfectly with this formula but i'll\u00a0\u00a0\nfix this look up and we can have a little chat\u00a0\nabout this first look okay so don't come for me\u00a0\u00a0\ni went really overboard with the eyeliner but i've\u00a0\nbeen really enjoying this shape with the very very\u00a0\u00a0\nlike bent up liner and then the little flick\u00a0\nin the inner corner i it's a new shape for\u00a0\u00a0\nlike i like eyeshadow and eyeliner that a lot\u00a0\nof people are doing on social media including me\u00a0\u00a0\nand i really enjoy it and it really gives your\u00a0\neye a different shape without doing this pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nawful to be honest pulling on your eyes which is\u00a0\nborderline racism i don't like it i hope that that\u00a0\u00a0\ntrend ends i really enjoy it and of course you\u00a0\ncan do this eye look without doing the dramatic\u00a0\u00a0\nliner i was just feeling dramatic makeup sue me\u00a0\nso yeah i really do enjoy this look let's get into\u00a0\u00a0\nthe next one i am going to do something really\u00a0\npurple like i want to use i want to use this one\u00a0\u00a0\nand probably this one but let's do something\u00a0\nreally purple okay so i have changed everything\u00a0\u00a0\nsince my last look there's different audio there's\u00a0\ndifferent lighting and there is a different\u00a0\u00a0\nsettings so i am sorry not really sorry i have\u00a0\nthe same foundation everything on though the\u00a0\u00a0\nsame foundation the same everything on just so\u00a0\nthat you can see how different it is now this is\u00a0\u00a0\nvery true to color from what i see on the monitor\u00a0\ni will pop off a little text here if i think it's\u00a0\u00a0\nthe same when i'm actually looking at the editing\u00a0\nthe only thing i've changed is that i have uh the\u00a0\u00a0\nsigma lip oil in tranquil on uh but same lip liner\u00a0\nthough but yeah i am trying to do the best i can\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm trying to do the best i can i'm gonna do\u00a0\na purple look like i said i am gonna start\u00a0\u00a0\ni think i'm gonna start with this one like\u00a0\nthe pinky purple and then i'm gonna deepen\u00a0\u00a0\nit up with this like plummy purple i'm trying\u00a0\nto do the best i can when it comes to like\nall of these things like setting and it's it's\u00a0\nhard let me just put it like that it is really\u00a0\u00a0\nhard sometimes with settings if somebody says like\u00a0\noh all you have to do is put on a camera and just\u00a0\u00a0\ndo your makeup it's so easy either they don't\u00a0\ncare about how the settings are or they've been\u00a0\u00a0\nextremely lucky because it is extremely hard with\u00a0\nlike settings and sound and color and if you're\u00a0\u00a0\nlike if you're like me and you want to make sure\u00a0\nthat what you are seeing on youtube is actually\u00a0\u00a0\nmy skin color the colors true to the palette\u00a0\nit is really really hard to make that happen\u00a0\u00a0\nthis color is a little weak this color is a little\u00a0\nweak so i am slightly sorry that i'm showing you\u00a0\u00a0\ntwo looks with different settings but just know\u00a0\nthat the swatches that you saw in the beginning\u00a0\u00a0\nthose are taking with these settings unless i\u00a0\nchange them again but yeah i just i'm trying\u00a0\u00a0\nto make things as true to life as possible\u00a0\nand i realize the other settings were really\u00a0\u00a0\npink and cool toned and it made everything look\u00a0\nlike i like had a different skin tone it made the\u00a0\u00a0\nwalls look like pink or gray but they're actually\u00a0\nlike a a like a warmer beige so yeah i'm doing the\u00a0\u00a0\nbest i can and you're probably gonna see this in\u00a0\nsome other videos as well with me just one look\u00a0\u00a0\nbeing one color and one look being another like i\u00a0\nfilm one look with the nomad palette for example\u00a0\u00a0\nand that is probably gonna be one of the looks\u00a0\nis gonna be what the pinky settings and then one\u00a0\u00a0\nof them is going to be with these settings that i\u00a0\nhope are better and also let me know how you feel\u00a0\u00a0\nabout the sound because i was able to finally\u00a0\nget my microphone to work in the setting it\u00a0\u00a0\nnever worked in my old beauty room maybe it was\u00a0\ncursed maybe was cursed by the sound devil but\u00a0\u00a0\nit is it is working in this space\u00a0\nthis pinky purple is very weak like\u00a0\u00a0\nit's very hard pressed it is a little weak like\u00a0\nyou can see i'm not super impressed let me see if\u00a0\u00a0\ni can build it up a bit and then we can go\u00a0\nin with the darker shade okay i'm not very\u00a0\u00a0\nimpressed with this feb's gem it is it's pretty\u00a0\nweak but we are going to use the royal affair\u00a0\u00a0\nand we're going to see if that one is better i\u00a0\nused a different primer today as well because i\u00a0\u00a0\nwas using the nyx primer yesterday i will link\u00a0\nthe primers down below as well and i thought it\u00a0\u00a0\nwas a little bit too sticky for this palette but\u00a0\nmaybe this palette needs the stickiness to get the\u00a0\u00a0\ncolors to be opaque because now i'm using one of\u00a0\nmy absolute favorite primers which is the julius\u00a0\u00a0\nplace primer and i don't feel like the colors are\u00a0\nsticking as good am i being picky maybe this okay\njust now this is my initial like after using\u00a0\nthis twice and it needs a sticky primer to show\u00a0\u00a0\nup really opaque but it is a little bit harder to\u00a0\nblend with the sticky primer i don't think that\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is that really amazing colourpop formula it's\u00a0\nnice but it's not that amazing like lush life is\u00a0\u00a0\nit called lush life or so lush i think it's called\u00a0\nso lush palette or the tinkerbell palette whatever\u00a0\u00a0\nthe orchid you not palette or the wine and only\u00a0\npalette like those four palettes for example and\u00a0\u00a0\nthe quads love the formula it's exceptional not\u00a0\ngood for the price but good this is good for the\u00a0\u00a0\nprice that's what this is good for the price so\u00a0\nyeah i'm gonna i'm gonna deepen this up and i'll\u00a0\u00a0\nuse a little bit under my eyes as well it was\u00a0\ndefinitely i'm able to build it up a bit but\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're not as intensely pigmented and like lack\u00a0\nof better word creamy well this one does build up\u00a0\u00a0\npretty nicely but they're not as creamy and as\u00a0\nbuildable and pigmented as some of the other\u00a0\u00a0\nshadows if you like shadows there are more on\u00a0\nthe buildable not so full on opaque you might\u00a0\u00a0\nprefer this one but it's not bad it's just not as\u00a0\ngood as some other colourpop palettes i've tried\u00a0\u00a0\nokay i'm not convinced i was able to build it\u00a0\nup like this is this is okay but it is it's not\u00a0\u00a0\nlike fully opaque and it is a little um i don't\u00a0\nknow i think i like the the dark taupey one\u00a0\u00a0\nmore than i like the purple ones like they're\u00a0\nfine but they're not perfect but i'm gonna use\u00a0\u00a0\namulet with it is that like very purple like\u00a0\nalmost like blue cool tone purple in the corner\u00a0\u00a0\nand do i have any settings i always spray my\u00a0\nshimmers always bring my shimmers i'm gonna spray\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one too this is not the right setting spray\u00a0\nfor this one and i'm gonna put that on the lid\u00a0\u00a0\nwell that this shimmers are beautiful\u00a0\nin this palette i gotta give it that\nthat i mean that is stunning\u00a0\nnobody can take that away from it\nmaybe we can like put a little more of the dark\u00a0\npurple if you're ever having any problems with\u00a0\u00a0\nlike being able to deepen up an outer corner\u00a0\nanything put a shimmer down and then put the\u00a0\u00a0\nmat on top the mat will for some weird reason\u00a0\njust build better on the shimmer and then you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan make it even darker like you can see\u00a0\nhere like the comparisons it's a good tip\u00a0\u00a0\nif you're looking for ways to make stuff\u00a0\neven more pigmented i think i'm gonna use\u00a0\u00a0\ni think i'm gonna use some of the brilliant\u00a0\nwhich is that first shade with the purple\u00a0\u00a0\nduochrome and i'm spraying that so\u00a0\nthat i can be more precise with it\u00a0\u00a0\nand i think i'm gonna do like a fall cut\u00a0\ncrease with this and just make it a little\nand just make it a little lighter on top i think\u00a0\nyou can see like it's lighter and then goes down\u00a0\u00a0\nto this darker purple and i'll put that\u00a0\nin the inner corners and a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nunder my eyes i think that\u00a0\nthat looks really pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nright maybe i'll even because i\u00a0\nbrought out a white i think i'm gonna\nthis is also my colourpop\nthat turned out pretty okay like i did a white\u00a0\nline this one is the uh bff liquid liner i think\u00a0\u00a0\nit's called yeah graceland it is a felt tip liner\u00a0\nbut it is pretty pigmented so it's actually quite\u00a0\u00a0\ngood if you just want to do white details\u00a0\ni've used it quite a lot on my channel so\u00a0\u00a0\ni really think that that one is pretty\u00a0\ngood i'm going to use some of this\u00a0\u00a0\nla girl shockwave neon eyeliner this is in\u00a0\nvivid which is the purple this is again this\u00a0\u00a0\nis fine but it's not the best one the two\u00a0\nblue ones in this series are a lot better\u00a0\u00a0\nthan any of the other colors like you can\u00a0\ntell you have to like build it up a bit\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i'll build this up i'll put some lashes on\u00a0\nand that's going to be the finished look but\u00a0\u00a0\ni mean i like this look but i also have things in\u00a0\nmy collection that perform better than this that i\u00a0\u00a0\ncan get a similar look with so i'm not like blown\u00a0\naway it's okay okay this is the finished look um\u00a0\u00a0\ni like how the look is looking you can\u00a0\ntell that it is a little bit patchy here\u00a0\u00a0\nnothing that's too horrible i mean i am gonna go\u00a0\nout in this look and i'm gonna feel totally fierce\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm gonna enjoy it but it is not the easiest\u00a0\npurples that i've ever worked with and it's also\u00a0\u00a0\nnot the best purples that i've used from colourpop\u00a0\nwhich i mean the packaging is stunning i love the\u00a0\u00a0\ncardboard packaging i'm just not 100 sure that\u00a0\nthis is like the best they've done when it comes\u00a0\u00a0\nto purple palettes and it makes me a little bit\u00a0\nsad to say that because it's like the packaging\u00a0\u00a0\nis so stunning i like the the color selection\u00a0\nbut the mattes aren't blowing me away they're\u00a0\u00a0\nnot blowing me away they're nice for the price but\u00a0\nhonestly i think the is it called lilac you a lot\u00a0\u00a0\ni think that one is better than this one i said\u00a0\nwhat i said anyways i hope you enjoyed the video\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me know what you think about the settings and\u00a0\nstuff as i'm seeing it right now on the monitor\u00a0\u00a0\nit looks good maybe my teeth is looking a little\u00a0\nbit more yellow than they are in real life but\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe that's not i'll i'll fix it i'll fix it\u00a0\nwith time let me know your thoughts down below\u00a0\u00a0\ni would say that this skin tone is very close\u00a0\nto my skin tone this is looking way more like me\u00a0\u00a0\nthan it did before but yeah i would love to\u00a0\nhear your thoughts down below i hope you're\u00a0\u00a0\nhaving an amazing day don't forget to subscribe\u00a0\nand i will see you again in my next video bye\nyou",

Regarding your set up, the lighting for the second look is perfect, and the sound quality is much better in the first look.<br><br>Also, with Ulta it&#39;s worth opening their emails and/or getting the app because they often offer special multipliers for rewards points (ie 5x the points on a certain brand or category). They&#39;re the easiest way to build points quickly and get free stuff. The offers have to be activated, though. And only redeem your points in increments of 2000 because that&#39;s the maximum value per point (the more points you redeem at once the more they&#39;re worth).",

Why so many variables and differences in quality when they literally own their own factory? Weird!<br><br>Either way, love the looks (and the eyeliner is fab on you)",

        "transcript_text": " Hi guys welcome back to my channel how are you all Hopefully\nalways healthy and always in the protection of Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala Today I want to\nmake a quick makeup tutorial without eyelashes, now this is perfect for those of you who want to\nlook good mangling fast but i don't want to wear these lashes i will tell you\nhow to do it so stay tuned and keep on watching wiratini fardhu Let's get Stories away subscribe\nand turn on the bell so you don't miss the latest video from me now i\nalready did skin preparation So Now I want to move on to the primer, I'll just use a\nregular trainer from Maybelline, which is more skin-pore eraser, only use it on the nose.\nNow while waiting for the primer, Wu to sink in. I want to make a foundation first, as usual\n, Wardah's microphone Edition, which has an extra cover, which I usually make. the tutorial\nin my previous video, you can just scroll down like this and the furniture\nis really good h, the machine lasts all day, now I'm demixing it in my hand, I\nforgot to take a spoon or valet for mixing Don't copy it but my hands are\nclean don't worry Now I'll apply it using an ordinary inner brush Because it's easier\nto apply and it'll be evenly distributed So, nothing is thick,\nnothing is thin, for more details, you guys, just watch the video. Kuyang mixes\ncheap foundation, anyway, I've made it complete in the video\n, all you have to do is watch it and see\n. Trust me,\nHi, you can see the one on the other side, there are still a\nlot of stains, yogs, the perpetrator said that\nit was very faded, after that, I smoothed it out using a sponge. Don't forget to\nuse a sponge , don't forget to use the soap, Allah is alive. I'm using this concealer.\nIt's a shame, it's a shame because I used Di under Arai\nfor diarrhea, highlights, I used a lighter color, sir ai concealer from spam. Cut\nthese two blanks, like on the bridge of the nose, keep sad on the forehead and also on the chin,\ncontinue to contour\n, yes, I am. From the beginning, if you make the contour of the nose area, you can never go straight\nand then blend it, it's\nokay, don't send it too much In this video I use the language sponge. Actually\nI don't like using a sponge that is too wet because it looks like it lifts the condition\nlike that it should be like a moist one. Just because I forgot her language from the start\nso I just got wet so she really died it felt like it I took a product like that\n. Hi but luckily it didn't lift too much. It's still OK, but if I had to choose\nI would prepare the moist one, not the dry, moist one. Then we set it using loose earth powder\n, which we forgot to put under the Eye Cream\n, which really wants to be like Mochi in Brazil to throw away our dreams. Audrey's mind doesn't work,\ndon't put too much putty now, this is the most important part, yes. Our important porter is on the eyebrows I want\nuse eyelash glue so that it lasts like eyebrows, often like that. This application glues directly to the eyebrows\n, this time I use the technique of laminating the eyebrows, how to close the eyebrows that we made earlier, using your\nbrother, the advantage is that it can make our eyebrow color easier if for example the color of\nyour pomade that's old, the rest is how to laminate eyebrows. It's the same as making regular eyebrows.\nThe state of the eyebrows has become really good, ready to like it. Now, let's get into eyeshadow. This is\nan important factor that makes us determined whether it will shine or not, even without eyelashes\n. Okay, now let's go straight Just start, I want to use a transition color outside of playing, the youngest\ngoes home Yud wants to go to the pink color, I mixed it with the one above, the color is\npeach pink orange, the color is moved, that's the result, when you see it, you want to bring chocolate and keep it quiet\non top, your color will continue to be overwritten. In the outer corner I took the brown color. I understand this,\nhe forgot to use it. Under the eye, I took the rest of the concealer brush for u To clean the corners\n, so that he's short, ala Foxy s700 goes up. Next, I want to use glitter.\nI use this coupler or I mix with the pinwheel Galaxy. The color\nis moved in Toyama up. I mean, here we go, this application is here.\nBanyu let the eyes live Yes, even if you don't wear lashes, it will still live, it will still\nglow quickly in Indonesia. I added a little color to SMPN Late in the middle\n, it's really pretty , I also added glitter\nfrom Lamela for the inner part of the Kaunar\n. If it's the inner corner,\nI mean Bigfoot, I really like it. Gar like that. This is also a very important part because this\nwill help make it clear or not. I'm using an eyeliner in the form of Wing,\nso the civil servants chat with us, so we can sharpen the corners. look for it hahaha\nHi all wedday sustenance like this I use white eyeliner from madamji and I curl my\nlashes to make them thicker uh, apply mascara from Wardah eyeexpert on the top and bottom, so\nthat the eyes are like this, my friends, I think the size without eyelashes is\nokay, now let's continue with the unfinished face, I want to use the contour\nas usual, products Cheap, in my opinion.

shop\u00a0\nmy stash type of situation today's theme is all\u00a0\u00a0\naround drugstore because seriously when did\u00a0\ni stop using drugstore that was something i\u00a0\u00a0\nreally realized last year that i just don't shop\u00a0\ndrugstore i'm not really staying up on those\u00a0\u00a0\nreleases i'm mostly buying things that are sold\u00a0\nat ultan sephora in the prestige section at least\u00a0\u00a0\nat ulta or indie which is a little bit different\u00a0\nbut even those can be kind of mid-tier even if\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're more affordable and so one of the things i\u00a0\nwant to do this year is use more drugstore try out\u00a0\u00a0\nmore drugstore find some affordable makeup see\u00a0\nwhat's out there man i think i thought i tried\u00a0\u00a0\nat least some more drugstore than i actually do\u00a0\nand so i kind of want to change that this year so\u00a0\u00a0\nwith that we're going to shop my stash i'm going\u00a0\nto go through and look and find some things that\u00a0\u00a0\nare drugstore or at least more affordable if i\u00a0\ndon't have like a traditional drugstore option\u00a0\u00a0\none i want to do this because i did buy some new\u00a0\ndrugstore stuff so we can use that together kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof try it out all of that as well as see what\u00a0\ni already have and kind of take inventory of my\u00a0\u00a0\ncollection with this specific lens so that way i\u00a0\ncan kind of know what i should be looking out for\u00a0\u00a0\nand kind of holes in my collection that i could\u00a0\ntry maybe a drugstore option see what's going on\u00a0\u00a0\nso i hope you guys enjoy that let's just get\u00a0\ninto the shop my stash and then we can put it on\u00a0\u00a0\nmy face all right guys let's get to shopping in\u00a0\nthe first drawer we're gonna start with primers\u00a0\u00a0\nand off the bat unfortunately i don't have\u00a0\nany drugstore primers like i have nothing more\u00a0\u00a0\naffordable really maybe this is the mo i don't\u00a0\neven know what the most affordable is they're\u00a0\u00a0\nall kind of expensive so not a great start i think\u00a0\ntoday i'm just gonna go with this tart one because\u00a0\u00a0\ni haven't used it in a while but definitely an\u00a0\narea i want to explore some drugstore primers for\u00a0\u00a0\npowders i have my aoa and this is a dollar so as\u00a0\nmuch as it's not available at like the drugstore\u00a0\u00a0\nlike walgreens and stuff it is very affordable for\u00a0\nfoundations i have my koki ones back here i don't\u00a0\u00a0\nknow if i even like those but one i do know i like\u00a0\nand really the only other option is this one from\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup revolution i've actually repurchased this\u00a0\nso i'm gonna use this stick foundation today and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen same with concealer not a lot of options so\u00a0\ni'm gonna go with the maybelline because it's what\u00a0\u00a0\ni have and i have been using this more recently\u00a0\nquite a bit and i've been enjoying it it's kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof a skinny wand but it's pretty dang good next\u00a0\nthis is like an eye drawer of sorts i don't really\u00a0\u00a0\nhave anything like drugstore over here for brows\u00a0\ni'm gonna get my covergirl i use that all the time\u00a0\u00a0\nbut it's actually drugstore and then i'm also the\u00a0\nonly other like affordable brow product i have is\u00a0\u00a0\nthis covergirl pencil so that's what we're gonna\u00a0\nuse today mascaras i don't have any drugstore\u00a0\u00a0\nstuff open but i do have some over here like from\u00a0\nessence that they've sent so i think i'm gonna use\u00a0\u00a0\nand open one of these have it going let's try\u00a0\nlash princess volume i know a lot of people like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe teal one but let's try this one and then\u00a0\nfor something new i just got this from la girl\u00a0\u00a0\nand it is a beautiful bronze liner so excited\u00a0\nto try this out i also got this neon yellow one\u00a0\u00a0\nhow pretty is that but i'm probably gonna do\u00a0\na more neutral look today so i'm gonna go with\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one for bronzers it is just grim when it\u00a0\ncomes to drugstore i literally have one option\u00a0\u00a0\nmy butter bronzer which i've been working to\u00a0\nuse up and i wouldn't repurchase this item but\u00a0\u00a0\nit's the only thing i have definitely on my list\u00a0\nis just bronzers in general but also drugstore\u00a0\u00a0\noptions like half the bronzers in here i feel\u00a0\nlike are discontinued or yeah or i don't like\u00a0\u00a0\nlove discontinued discontinued discontinued um\u00a0\ndon't love don't like love don't really even use\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is a contour like it's it's grim over here\u00a0\nbut i'm gonna put this in um we'll talk more about\u00a0\u00a0\nbronzers in a second but for sprays i only have\u00a0\nthe koki one so i guess i'll put it in in case i\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to use it oh man the beautiful blush drawer i\u00a0\nlove this thing and i definitely want to use some\u00a0\u00a0\nof my new products i picked up some of the milani\u00a0\nblushes rose really pretty but i think i'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\ngo with classic luminoso um it's in new packaging\u00a0\nbut i think seriously the only other option that i\u00a0\u00a0\nhave is this wet and wild blush i think literally\u00a0\neverything else in here is quite pricey or if it's\u00a0\u00a0\nnot i guess it's like from yes style so definitely\u00a0\nsome room there i think highlighters are going to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe another drawer that's similar i know i have\u00a0\nthis pixi one that's drugstore but still kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nexpensive it's definitely not like as affordable\u00a0\ni guess uh i know i have my colourpop i'm trying\u00a0\u00a0\nnot to use too much colourpop because it's such\u00a0\nan easy option i i do want to kind of try some\u00a0\u00a0\ntraditional drugstore brands and see what they\u00a0\nhave but i think we're gonna have to go with this\u00a0\u00a0\none for now and now we have lip products another\u00a0\ntough one kind of i know i got this maybelline\u00a0\u00a0\nlifter gloss recently and then i do have some\u00a0\nnyx butter glosses i loved these back in the day\u00a0\u00a0\nand so i decided to pick some up so i think i'm\u00a0\ngoing to put some of the brown ones in this one's\u00a0\u00a0\nmadeline i have uh butterscotch this one's sugar\u00a0\nhigh i'm gonna put all three in and we'll see i\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't think i have like any drugstore lip liners\u00a0\nthis is another area i definitely want to look\u00a0\u00a0\ninto jane iredale is not too bad but 17 compared\u00a0\nto something that's like four or five bucks is a\u00a0\u00a0\ndifference so definitely want to explore some\u00a0\ndrugstore lip liners i'm gonna use spice today\u00a0\u00a0\nthough this drawer i'm really excited for because\u00a0\ni do have some options in here that i'm excited\u00a0\u00a0\nto put in my basket today i recently got some of\u00a0\nthese j cat pris metal eyeshadows they're kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a cream and i definitely want to use those\u00a0\ni think today so this one's called chrome crusher\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm also gonna put in frosty foil and i guess i'll\u00a0\ngive myself a warmer option this one is called\u00a0\u00a0\nmelted crystal so um yeah i'm gonna put some\u00a0\nof those in i don't have any cream shadows like\u00a0\u00a0\nin sticks which usually is what i use to prime\u00a0\nmy eyes so i'm just gonna put the sigma one in\u00a0\u00a0\nhere but another area i could maybe look into and\u00a0\nalso an area i think the drugstore would actually\u00a0\u00a0\nhave options in like stick cream shadows and now\u00a0\nwe get into palettes i definitely want to have\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe a matte or something which this might be the\u00a0\nperfect time to actually bust into these i think\u00a0\u00a0\ni'll take the taupe it up which is more cool toned\u00a0\nand then i'm going to take maybe the bronzed one\u00a0\u00a0\njust kind of depending on which way i take my look\u00a0\nso i'll do those two since i haven't i've been\u00a0\u00a0\nwanting to use them and i just haven't yet so boom\u00a0\nwe're gonna use them hello that means we really\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't need to get into the big palettes but i\u00a0\nguess i'll still take a gander and see if there's\u00a0\u00a0\nanything in here most of my bigger palettes\u00a0\nare not necessarily drugstore so i have some\u00a0\u00a0\ncolourpop though those would probably be the ones\u00a0\ni have some bh those are again more affordable\u00a0\u00a0\nbut not a ton of options at least in my current\u00a0\ncollection i do have the jungle lights i don't\u00a0\u00a0\nknow if i'll use this maybe i'll do another uh\u00a0\nvideo like this trying more drugstore or something\u00a0\u00a0\nso we can actually use that on camera i also have\u00a0\nthis wet and wild maybe we can do a throwback\u00a0\u00a0\nvideo but i think this is going to be my makeup\u00a0\nbasket for today so let's try it on all right so\u00a0\u00a0\ni definitely don't have a lot of drugstore stuff\u00a0\ni think that's pretty freaking obvious from doing\u00a0\u00a0\nthat like i have some pockets for sure but really\u00a0\nnot not a lot going on so i'm going to zoom this\u00a0\u00a0\nin we'll get started i really hope my clips aren't\u00a0\noff today i like used to feel weird wearing these\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i think it's kind of cute but man trying to\u00a0\nget these even is a task it is a task starting off\u00a0\u00a0\ndidn't even have a drugstore primer i'm actually\u00a0\nreally excited to try some drugstore primers\u00a0\u00a0\nthough so i'm gonna use this video i'm sure some\u00a0\nof you guys have left me recommendations before\u00a0\u00a0\nbut if you have specific recommendations that you\u00a0\nthink i would like or that are your favs in any of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe categories i'm light on drugstore options\u00a0\nor don't have any i would love love love the\u00a0\u00a0\nrecommendations you guys off the bat something\u00a0\ni'm thinking i know there's some nyx ones out\u00a0\u00a0\nthere that are kind of intriguing to me but i know\u00a0\nelf has some good options i mean i haven't tried\u00a0\u00a0\nstuff from elf in forever just in general i should\u00a0\nprobably explore elf a little bit because they are\u00a0\u00a0\none of the most affordable you know drugstore type\u00a0\nbrands out there even with their price increases\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're still super affordable all right\u00a0\nmoving on to foundation this is one of my\u00a0\u00a0\nfavorite foundations the makeup revolution i use\u00a0\nthe shade f4 it's a little bit um pink on me but\u00a0\u00a0\nit just has great coverage this is like a really\u00a0\nhigh coverage foundation which is actually going\u00a0\u00a0\nto be great for me right now because seriously my\u00a0\nskin has been acting up i have not been keeping\u00a0\u00a0\nup on my skincare like i should be and so\u00a0\ni just feel like i have these tiny little\u00a0\u00a0\nbreakouts all over the place honestly but\u00a0\nthis should do the trick like it should\u00a0\u00a0\ncover pretty well i'm gonna use a little brush\u00a0\nthis one is from refer and it's one of the only\u00a0\u00a0\nthings i really know what to do with this brush\u00a0\nbecause it's kind of odd but i normally wouldn't\u00a0\u00a0\nuse a brush but i do want maybe it's a bad idea\u00a0\nto use a brush i don't know if my skin's in the\u00a0\u00a0\ncondition honestly i know it'd be like way faster\u00a0\nbut ugh i think we're gonna have to do a sponge\u00a0\u00a0\ni just wanted a fuller coverage because i am\u00a0\ndealing with breakouts and like you know just\u00a0\u00a0\noverall not the best like smoothest or clearest\u00a0\nskin but along with not taking care of my skin or\u00a0\u00a0\ndoing my skincare correctly i will get dry patches\u00a0\nand as i've told you guys before if i do a brush\u00a0\u00a0\nespecially when my skin has those dry patches\u00a0\nbaby you're gonna see them from outer space\u00a0\u00a0\nokay i'm gonna flake off skin right on you it just\u00a0\ndoesn't look like the smooth skin application you\u00a0\u00a0\nreally want so oh god of course if you guys\u00a0\nhave recommendations for drugstore foundations\u00a0\u00a0\ni would love those too i kind of want to try the\u00a0\nmaybelline fit me i was never a fit me girl like i\u00a0\u00a0\nalways liked something more mattifying and also a\u00a0\nlittle bit more full coverage back in the day but\u00a0\u00a0\nnow i think i might be a fit me girl i think that\u00a0\nmight be a fit me girl so let me know any of your\u00a0\u00a0\nguys's recommendations i think i'm gonna add a\u00a0\nlittle bit more though i know i'm gonna go in with\u00a0\u00a0\nconcealer still but i just always have so much\u00a0\nredness right there and also right there and also\u00a0\u00a0\nmy nose is just it's a disaster guys i'm trying\u00a0\nto just be okay with the fact that my skin's not\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna look perfect because i haven't been taking\u00a0\ncare of it if you're finding your foundation isn't\u00a0\u00a0\nworking well and you aren't doing a good skincare\u00a0\nroutine i would start there because that's really\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat's gonna help your base we're doing something\u00a0\nkind of chill every day anyway i shouldn't get\u00a0\u00a0\ntoo carried away for concealer i'm using the\u00a0\nmaybelline fit me i'm using the shade fair\u00a0\u00a0\ni do find this kind of deepens up like oxidizes\u00a0\nin a way um so fair actually works pretty well\u00a0\u00a0\nfor me i just think this is a pretty solid you\u00a0\nknow like concealer i don't have like issues with\u00a0\u00a0\nit i guess like i don't find it overly creases\u00a0\nit's not too dewy it's not too mattifying it's\u00a0\u00a0\nnot too full coverage the color is not super off\u00a0\nlike you know all those things that for me make\u00a0\u00a0\nor break a concealer it doesn't have any of\u00a0\nthe breaking points so i like that about it i\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely want to try that nyx one that serum\u00a0\none although i think it's pretty full coverage\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i do want to try it but it's sold all the way\u00a0\nout on ulta next the only bronzer i have that's\u00a0\u00a0\ndrugstore this is the physicians formula one\u00a0\nthat i've been trying to use up for i don't even\u00a0\u00a0\nknow how long yet used to be one of my favorites\u00a0\ndefinitely isn't now and i won't be repurchasing\u00a0\u00a0\nthis product and i wanted to talk about this\u00a0\ntoo i think actually one of the reasons that\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe i have kind of gone to higher end is\u00a0\nthere tends to be more options when it comes to\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor like a lot of drugstore things at least\u00a0\nback in the day i don't know how different it\u00a0\u00a0\nis now we'll have to get into you know i'll be\u00a0\nexploring that but back in the day it's like\u00a0\u00a0\ntwo options for bronzer and sometimes that still\u00a0\nworks for me personally but something i try to do\u00a0\u00a0\nis i do want to buy stuff that is inclusive\u00a0\nand has a better range and is trying to serve\u00a0\u00a0\npeople of all different complexion colors\u00a0\nespecially as someone who talks about products\u00a0\u00a0\nand recommends them i want to be able to recommend\u00a0\nproducts that all of my subscribers could go out\u00a0\u00a0\nand check out and that has definitely stopped me\u00a0\nwhen it comes to drugstore bronzers it's rough out\u00a0\u00a0\nthere that is definite i know specifically on the\u00a0\nbronzer front that is why i haven't been buying\u00a0\u00a0\ni mean i know i've had a lot of recommendations\u00a0\nfrom you guys but if it's not even like a decent\u00a0\u00a0\nlike range i'm not gonna go in buying that i'm not\u00a0\nand i mean it's tough because like what is decent\u00a0\u00a0\nand what isn't that's a whole thing but i do my\u00a0\nbest and a lot of the drugstore brands out there\u00a0\u00a0\nare not even trying to do their best they're\u00a0\nnot even trying to do anything so if you have\u00a0\u00a0\na recommendation for a bronzer that you feel like\u00a0\nhas a good shade range and you like let me know\u00a0\u00a0\nthat because that's definitely been the struggle\u00a0\nwith the bronzers for sure okay i'm so excited you\u00a0\u00a0\nguys to try out the milani luminoso it's been a\u00a0\nlong time i think i'm gonna use this wispy brush\u00a0\u00a0\nto do it but oh powdery that was powdery it was\u00a0\nlike a baked formula this is definitely more\u00a0\u00a0\npeachy orange it's beautiful it's going to be\u00a0\ngreat i think specifically in springtime although\u00a0\u00a0\ni mean don't get me wrong i wear a peachy blush\u00a0\nquite often but i am in the market hopefully\u00a0\u00a0\nthis year for a few more neutral brown type of\u00a0\nblushes i think this would be so pretty though\u00a0\u00a0\nthis brush with a similar formula but in a deeper\u00a0\ncolor or brighter color it's like really applying\u00a0\u00a0\nso nicely but beautiful like i'm so into these\u00a0\ni want them to have like way more colors like\u00a0\u00a0\nwhy don't they have more colors than what they do\u00a0\nfor highlighter i guess since i just put all that\u00a0\u00a0\non my cheeks i'm gonna use the color pop\u00a0\nhighlighter this one's in seismic i'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nuse this like on my nose i'm gonna zoom you\u00a0\nin a little oh every time don't mind my skin\u00a0\u00a0\num you know if you can see it this is my real\u00a0\nskin on a bad skin day but i'm gonna put some\u00a0\u00a0\non my nose definitely trying to tap that out\u00a0\nthis is definitely like a sparklier highlight\u00a0\u00a0\nand i do find that it goes best on top of like\u00a0\ncreams not powdered skin but i'm trying to stick\u00a0\u00a0\nto places i haven't really powdered as much so\u00a0\nthat it can look as good as possible i'm not gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nwell should i try it on my cheeks let's just try\u00a0\nit could be a disaster but let's go i'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nactually like put it from my eye i like that look\u00a0\ni told you guys in a video recently like i like\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen there's highlighter or just like shimmery\u00a0\nproducts like right there so i'm gonna go out\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom my eye and then kind of onto the cheekbone i\u00a0\ndefinitely like this product with my finger if you\u00a0\u00a0\nuse a sponge you're only gonna get the shimmer\u00a0\nlike the glittery shimmer particles instead of\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of this overall wet looking shine\u00a0\ni think it went pretty nicely over that\nmaybe i'm a little more scared of this highlighter\u00a0\nthan i should be because i think it's looking\u00a0\u00a0\ni mean it's there you can see it but i think it\u00a0\nlooks really nice actually oh yeah i'm definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nlooking shiny um i think that overall everything\u00a0\nlooks pretty good but i am gonna just set i think\u00a0\u00a0\nlike kind of my mouth and t-zone and stuff i can\u00a0\nzoom this back out so you can actually see what's\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing on the aoa powder has been a favorite for\u00a0\na long time if you just want like a light set\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's not going to really look powdery i think\u00a0\nthis is a great one it doesn't like keep you matte\u00a0\u00a0\nall day for sure but it does cut shine\u00a0\nwithout really looking like anything on\u00a0\u00a0\nyour skin and i love that especially\u00a0\ntoo if you use a setting spray after\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful i've had this in my collection a long\u00a0\ntime i don't know if i like that highlighter on\u00a0\u00a0\nmy nose that's the only thing but my nose is\u00a0\na rack it's an absolute wreck right now let's\u00a0\u00a0\nget the eyebrows out of the way um i'm gonna\u00a0\nbe only keeping this to the outer part of my\u00a0\u00a0\nbrow because it's quite dark and i'm gonna\u00a0\ntry not to get out of control with it so\u00a0\u00a0\nwish me luck um i'm gonna speed this up just do\u00a0\nmy normal brow stuff but with this dark ass pencil\nall right i mean i always comment on my brows like\u00a0\ni come back and i'm like telling you what i feel\u00a0\u00a0\nabout them and like today it's just kind of like\u00a0\nit could have been worse and it's not so i'm okay\u00a0\u00a0\nwith that priming my eyelids i'm gonna be using\u00a0\nthat sigma one but i think i mean i like the nyx\u00a0\u00a0\nglitter glue for a more sticky primer and i know\u00a0\nlike a classic primer is the uh milani one like\u00a0\u00a0\ni mean that's just like an emily noel classic\u00a0\nproduct recommendation right there um so maybe\u00a0\u00a0\ni will try that one but at the same time i'm\u00a0\nnot really concerned about primers right now i\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't know if anything i'd probably get a shadow\u00a0\nstick that could work as a primer and also work\u00a0\u00a0\nas a shadow over just getting the a primer when\u00a0\ni already have a primer and we all know how long\u00a0\u00a0\nthose take to use it alright so for the eye look\u00a0\nlet's zoom in zoom in zoom in why can't i know\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich way to zoom it's like my brain will never\u00a0\nlock that information in i think i do want to use\u00a0\u00a0\nthis as like my lid color my gosh these are very\u00a0\nsimilar to like the phase zero and kind of similar\u00a0\u00a0\nto rowan you guys like look at that look at that\u00a0\ni got this for three dollars and fifty cents\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is what's getting me excited like finding\u00a0\nthose gems i think that's another thing like\u00a0\u00a0\ntrying to do products that i really like or try\u00a0\nto find those special gems because not everything\u00a0\u00a0\nis special some things are just workhorse they're\u00a0\nfine but finding those true gems that aren't just\u00a0\u00a0\nlike hey if you don't want to spend the money you\u00a0\ncould get this like maybe it's not the best or you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow has this pros and cons but instead are just\u00a0\nlike it doesn't matter what else is out there this\u00a0\u00a0\nis this is the thing like this is the best product\u00a0\nthat's the like drugstore i want to tap into\u00a0\u00a0\nthose little products i want to suss out sniff\u00a0\nout like a little truffle pig okay anyway this\u00a0\u00a0\ni want to use on my lid today so i think i'm going\u00a0\nto go with the the taupe shades and i'm going to\u00a0\u00a0\npray that i have an eye brush here just kind\u00a0\nof cleaning it off something i really want to\u00a0\u00a0\ndo is kind of i know we're already into the\u00a0\nnew year but i really want to take some time\u00a0\u00a0\ndo a little clean clean my makeup like sanitize\u00a0\nsome stuff like really just get in there love\u00a0\u00a0\non it and appreciate it all that type of stuff\u00a0\nespecially to my single shadows i don't know if\u00a0\u00a0\ni mentioned this in a video but i am planning on\u00a0\ndoing singles week um one of you guys or a couple\u00a0\u00a0\nof you guys actually had the brilliant idea to\u00a0\ndo singles week during uh valentine's day like\u00a0\u00a0\non that period of time so that's when i'm going\u00a0\nto be doing it so i want to like have that kind of\u00a0\u00a0\ncleaned up and ready to go you know single\u00a0\nshadows just get their little shimmer particles on\u00a0\u00a0\neverything they crack sometimes it just can get a\u00a0\nlittle dirty um you know shimmery dirty but still\u00a0\u00a0\ni want to kind of clean that up i want to clean\u00a0\nmy palettes up i want to clean out my drawers i\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to clean my brushes you know i try to do\u00a0\nthese videos where i'm like clean your brushes\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause you guys i'm talking to myself i'm the\u00a0\nfreaking worst i'm so bad at cleaning my brushes\u00a0\u00a0\nso yeah i need to do that but okay i want to use\u00a0\nthat i think to deepen up but i'm going to do it\u00a0\u00a0\nafter i put this cream shadow on because it's\u00a0\na shimmer let's just dive in again this is the\u00a0\u00a0\nchrome crusher shade so pretty i hope it looks\u00a0\ngood oh it's so sparkly you guys i'm so excited\u00a0\u00a0\nfor this i feel like if you wanted it more sheer\u00a0\nit's gonna turn more sparkly and if you want it\u00a0\u00a0\nmore opaque it's gonna look more like metallic\u00a0\nso pretty it's like a disco ball like a smokey\u00a0\u00a0\neye disco ball it's pretty dark it's like darker\u00a0\nthan i thought definitely giving me smokey eye\u00a0\u00a0\ni am excited to continue testing these and kind of\u00a0\ngetting back to you on what i think because this\u00a0\u00a0\nis the first time i'm like actually using them on\u00a0\nmy eye so i want to see if they crease or if they\u00a0\u00a0\nlock down or all those things initially very\u00a0\nbeautiful can't believe it was 3.50 i mean\u00a0\u00a0\ni think they normally retail for like maybe\u00a0\nalmost at six dollars but the deal i got them\u00a0\u00a0\non at ulta i kind of been watching out for them\u00a0\nand then they went on sale at ulta so i was like\u00a0\u00a0\nokay it's time to strike i mean it almost kind\u00a0\nof deepens up on its own because the base like\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen it shines it shines lighter but then that\u00a0\nbase does have a little bit of that depth to it\u00a0\u00a0\nso it's quite pretty as a one shadow look although\u00a0\ni could see if you went too heavy on the lids\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me zoom you in even more if you went too\u00a0\nheavy on the lids you could get a little scaly but\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is it just with that matte blending them\u00a0\nout but other than that it's just the one shadow\u00a0\u00a0\ni like it i definitely want to try it too just on\u00a0\nits own almost and see i'm gonna blend out on the\u00a0\u00a0\nedges just with that initial color we had making\u00a0\nsure we have some soft edges it's definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nmore smoky than the look i thought it was going\u00a0\nto do today but i'm not mad at it i think i do\u00a0\u00a0\nstill want to deepen up even though it's kind\u00a0\nof smoky because i know it still will add a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nto the look so i'm going to take the black or the\u00a0\ngray it's not black it's like a gray this is just\u00a0\u00a0\na little pencil brush i'm just kind of smudging it\u00a0\nclose to the lash line just adding the tiniest bit\u00a0\u00a0\ni actually like that this is shimmery because i\u00a0\nthink it's going to go well with the already kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof shimmer we have going on definitely getting\u00a0\nsome fallout and i'm going to blend a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit on the lower lash line not a ton because\u00a0\ni still want to use that brown liner which\u00a0\u00a0\nwe'll see how clashy that gets i'm just blending\u00a0\nout with that brush we already have we're gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nembrace the grunge try to wipe away fallout but\u00a0\nembrace the grunge i'm not really feeling the\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlights in here for this look so i'm gonna\u00a0\nuse the powder highlighter and use that gold\u00a0\u00a0\ni think it will just be hopefully nice to warm\u00a0\nit up in one area at least so i'm putting this\u00a0\u00a0\non my brow bone and then i'm also going to\u00a0\nlightly kind of put it in my inner corner\u00a0\u00a0\ni kind of want it a little more diffused even\u00a0\nif it's kind of strong since it is golden then\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm going to use that bronze liner i'm going to\u00a0\nput that on my bottom lash line i'm going to do\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit of tight lining as well i'm hoping\u00a0\nthat just like the darkness of this comes through\u00a0\u00a0\nand not too much of the warmth i'm hopeful\u00a0\nbecause i did swatch this and i think that's\u00a0\u00a0\nexactly what's gonna happen and is happening it's\u00a0\nnot you can't like tell it's like super bronzy\u00a0\u00a0\nokay we went so smoke what happened when\u00a0\ndid this look become so smoky you guys\u00a0\u00a0\ni hope it's even i'm realizing i'm not sure if\u00a0\nthat's the case but i'm gonna put some mascara\u00a0\u00a0\non we're using that lash princess volume see\u00a0\nhow that goes has like a little curved wand okay\nit's definitely not being clumpy like i'm\u00a0\nalmost having not trouble but i'm working\u00a0\u00a0\nto get that product on my lashes so sometimes with\u00a0\nthe volumizing ones it just turns into clump city\u00a0\u00a0\nso fast but definitely so far not the case on this\u00a0\nhas potential definitely has potential all right\u00a0\u00a0\nso the mascara is on i'll definitely have to keep\u00a0\nusing it to let you guys know my thoughts it's\u00a0\u00a0\njust how it works with mascara for me before i can\u00a0\ngive like anything meaningful i definitely have to\u00a0\u00a0\nkeep trying it i tend to like stuff the more i use\u00a0\nit when it comes to mascara and i didn't hate that\u00a0\u00a0\none enough to like not use it you know like it\u00a0\nwas pretty good pretty decent so i want to see if\u00a0\u00a0\ni can kind of like master how to work it you know\u00a0\nlet's do lips so then we can like get this thing\u00a0\u00a0\ndone and we can talk about a few first impressions\u00a0\ngoing on i'm just using that spice lip liner\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm glad i have like a neutral lip going for a\u00a0\nlip i know these all look the same but they're\u00a0\u00a0\nnot they're not the same i kind of like this one\u00a0\nuh butterscotch it is the darkest but it's also\u00a0\u00a0\nthe most brown and not pink and that's kind of\u00a0\nwhat i was hoping for i remember loving the scent\u00a0\u00a0\nof these it doesn't feel as strong but it's like\u00a0\nthis icing i think they used to be stronger i just\u00a0\u00a0\nhave a more strong memory associated to the other\u00a0\nones but let me zoom out so you can see the full\u00a0\u00a0\nlook i'm realizing i don't know if i gave you like\u00a0\na fully sufficient up close eye look shot so let's\u00a0\u00a0\ndo that first actually so this is what the eye\u00a0\nlook looks like up close it's super like sparkly\u00a0\u00a0\ni mean like this is so pretty to me the way that\u00a0\nthis highlighter is it's an all like shimmery eye\u00a0\u00a0\nbut kind of smoky i wasn't expecting such a smoky\u00a0\nlook but i think it's really pretty don't love the\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlighter on the nose i can tell you that i can\u00a0\ntell you that right now okay but here we are all\u00a0\u00a0\nzoomed out i again wasn't expecting the look to\u00a0\nturn out this way so i feel like my outfit and\u00a0\u00a0\noh my gosh my clip it's all out of whack okay i'm\u00a0\ngonna fix it in a second y'all i'm gonna fix it\u00a0\u00a0\nin a second anyway can we just finish the video\u00a0\nplease i feel like this looks a little bit more\u00a0\u00a0\nrocker smokey than like maybe the prairie like\u00a0\ncutesy look i was going for but that's okay um\u00a0\u00a0\nsome first impressions i definitely want to shout\u00a0\nout although i've used this once i didn't think\u00a0\u00a0\nit was horrible but i mean i used this shade and\u00a0\nthis shade and like yeah they worked i don't know\u00a0\u00a0\ni know these are very affordable i'm not convinced\u00a0\nthat they're still like necessarily worth it i\u00a0\u00a0\njust feel like there's not a lot of depth i had\u00a0\nto build up this color quite a bit i don't know\u00a0\u00a0\nwe'll see i'm going to keep testing them see if\u00a0\nthere's one maybe that works the best out of all\u00a0\u00a0\nof them but i definitely have like better options\u00a0\nin my collection so there's that and i know that\u00a0\u00a0\nthose are more expensive but still not one of the\u00a0\ngems i'm talking about here one of the gems though\u00a0\u00a0\nthis i'm so excited to keep testing it out\u00a0\nagain first impression so we'll see but very\u00a0\u00a0\nhopeful lots of good stuff going on with that the\u00a0\nmascara seems hopeful as well i mean i have a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nof different essence ones to try so i'm not sure\u00a0\nthis one exactly the volume will be my number one\u00a0\u00a0\nfavorite but i do think that they have some decent\u00a0\noptions and i want to like try them out and see\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich one of their mascaras is my favorite really\u00a0\nexcited to have the butter lip glosses back in\u00a0\u00a0\nmy collection i mean this isn't like a first\u00a0\nimpression and that i have tried these i know i\u00a0\u00a0\nlove this formula so comfortable so creamy like\u00a0\nnot too opaque kind of this perfect opaqueness\u00a0\u00a0\nso really excited to have these and these are\u00a0\nstill five bucks like pretty dang affordable\u00a0\u00a0\nand if you can catch them on a deal you can get\u00a0\nthem even cheaper i feel like they have a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nof options whether you want colorful or you want\u00a0\nsomething more neutral in a range of neutral so\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah really like those i'm also really excited\u00a0\nabout the milani blushes um i think that this is\u00a0\u00a0\nreally really beautiful and i'm excited to keep\u00a0\ntrying it as well as the other ones that i have\u00a0\u00a0\nit's hard to tell online like the differences\u00a0\ni feel like they're a bit subtle between the\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferences on the ones that they have so it'll\u00a0\nbe interesting to see which one kind of comes out\u00a0\u00a0\non top as my favorite and i think one of the last\u00a0\nlike first impression type things is that liner i\u00a0\u00a0\nreally like the way this turned out i love that\u00a0\nit's a pretty dark brown liner it's not as harsh\u00a0\u00a0\nas black but it definitely gives me the depth\u00a0\nwe'll see how it like stays in place and whatnot\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i'm excited to have a bronze that's not super\u00a0\nwarm bronzes tend to go like kind of orangey or\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah really warm and so i kind of like that this\u00a0\none's cooler it reminds me out in a way color wise\u00a0\u00a0\nto the charlotte tilbury one i use although this\u00a0\none seems creamier than that one that one's a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle bit just different formulas for sure but\u00a0\ncolor wise similar and overall lots of really\u00a0\u00a0\ngreat products and i think that my look turned\u00a0\nout really beautiful i could see myself creating

                "comment": "I stopped buying drug store when I became more skilled in makeup. As a black woman, the shade ranges and undertones just weren&#39;t there. Although shade ranges have come along way, there is still room for improvement in the drug store. With that being said, I purchased the L&#39;Oreal skin tint serum which was my first drug store purchase in years. I also dont like drug store eyeshadows because the quality isnt there - this includes Colourpop for me. I also recognized drug duping just lead me spend more vs spending the money on what I really wanted and being 100% satisfied. Idk, im trying to get into drug store more now that my collection is 95% where I want it to be.",

                    "I definitely agree. I live in Germany and the shade range in the drugstore is even worse here than the US. If I want base products, I can only buy them online, because they don&#39;t carry our shades in-store and opened makeup is non-refundable. So I just don&#39;t bother with it anymore. They used to have them. Maybelline once discontinued the FitMe shades after 335 here and only brought them back after backlash and petitions.<br><br> At least stores like Sephora or Douglas have mid-range to high-end brands with decent shade ranges to try out in-store. Also, a lot of drugstore brands feel like the fast fashion of makeup like Colourpop.",
                    "I dealt with the same thing there isn\u2019t a lot of options for black people or people in color in general and I started using mid range to high end because if this",
                    "I am also a black woman and agree about the shade range. I also feel like drug store foundations never really catered to people with oily skin either so even if they did have my shade, i wouldn&#39;t work for me anyways.",
                    "@Tash the one dupe that has been fantastic is the ccolor  dupe for Born to Run. I have both and actually like the dupe better. It\u2019s easier to travel with, too. But every other dupe I\u2019ve tried is garbage so I\u2019ve stopped trying. So many wasted resources and unnecessary, unsustainable waste. I\u2019d rather have quality than volume.",
                    "I tried to like CP but their glitters are garbage and get all over everything. I depotted all of them and 6 palette pack whittled to 3. 3 I never use. I feel like I totally wasted $60 on them when I could have just bought one higher end palette that I love and use. People scoff at $130 for ND or PMG but I\u2019d rather have one really good useable palette than a bunch of mediocre ones that don\u2019t work for me."

They recently launched No Budge shadow sticks which you may like as primers, having tried the 4 pack holiday set I can say they are TRULY no budge but the shimmers and metallics are more of a suggestion than anything (fine for primer use imo). They do possibly play up texture or scaliness so YMMV. They also had a mini putty primer 3 pack for holiday that would probably be good for trying, their Poreless Putty Primer is a cult favourite and they also have Matte and Luminous options if you prefer that. It&#39;s just such a great brand! Surprised you don&#39;t have much from them, definitely a great place to start on a drug store journey.",

                    "I love elf, but I do find their products hit or miss.  The hits truly are banger, but the misses...oof.  For example, for the waterline, the shadowsticks are my go to.  They truly do not budge.  Their eyeliner is a hard pass.  I can make the liner work if I set it with powder, but who wants to do that?  The cheek products skew fair.  I am a light/medium and I find I have to buy their darker shades to work on my skin.  Props to elf&#39;s website.  I can only get a limited amount of products from my small town drugstore.  $15 to get free shipping and wicked good gifts/sales makes the website a go to for me.",

From Revolution i recommend Hydrate &amp; Fix setting spray, their reloaded blushes and bronzers. Nyx- sweet cheeks blush either matte Or shimmery they have beautiful shades, I also love Nyx tinted skin veil. As far as eyeshadow goes Essence has those 3,5\u20ac palettes and Catrice has bigger ones that are good not great. I think makeup Obsession has great eyeshadow. As for liner 100% Catrice tattoo ink Or that Nyx one ink something they are basically the same.",

really\u00a0\nneeded um i needed a foundation of concealer\u00a0\u00a0\num a bronzer and just like some other random\u00a0\nthings and i actually found something unexpected\u00a0\u00a0\nthat i i don't

i\u00a0\u00a0\nthink it's a fairly new brand um not that new but\u00a0\nit's just a brand that i feel like it's a smaller\u00a0\u00a0\nbrand that not everyone talks about all the time\u00a0\nand i think it's a really good brand so i figured\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me try some of their products and review it\u00a0\nfor you guys so everyone can see for themselves\u00a0\u00a0\nso let's go ahead and just

really\u00a0\u00a0\nneeded um i needed a foundation of concealer a\u00a0\nbronzer and just like some other random things\u00a0\u00a0\nand i actually found something unexpected that\u00a0\ni i don't know why i didn't know about this from\u00a0\u00a0\nbefore but i guess i haven't been keeping\u00a0\nup as closely as i thought but jaclyn hill\u00a0\u00a0\npalette volume two um and it's so pretty so i'll\u00a0\nreview that with you guys and do like a sort of\u00a0\u00a0\nfirst impression even though yesterday i couldn't\u00a0\nhelp myself and i just like did like a couple\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent looks looks just real quick just on my\u00a0\neyes and i just like i posted some pictures on\u00a0\u00a0\ninstagram about it because i was just so excited\u00a0\nbut it's still like a first impression so um\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah i can't wait to show you guys all these\u00a0\nthings and do like a little review mini review\u00a0\u00a0\nso yeah let's go and i also review juvia's place\u00a0\nwhich is another like i think it's a fairly new\u00a0\u00a0\nbrand um not that new but it's just a brand that\u00a0\ni feel like it's a smaller brand that not everyone\u00a0\u00a0\ntalks about all the time and i think it's a really\u00a0\ngood brand so i figured let me try some of their\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts and review it for you guys so everyone\u00a0\ncan see for themselves so let's go ahead and\u00a0\u00a0\njust dive right into it so first thing is i got\u00a0\nthis nyx professional makeup plump right back\u00a0\u00a0\num plumping serum and primer it looks like that\u00a0\nand vessel is having a situation with the kids\noh it's like thick okay it's like a gel it's\u00a0\nlike a thick gel okay it's not that thick\nokay um so this was really nice um it's like\u00a0\nreally tacky on the skin and it had kind of like a\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a gel sort of primer consistency um i liked\u00a0\nit but let's see how it wears throughout the day\u00a0\u00a0\num yeah i'm gonna go ahead with foundation\u00a0\nright away and i also got this maybelline\u00a0\u00a0\nfoundation third the 30 hour foundation um the\u00a0\nsuper stay active wear 30 hour foundation and i\u00a0\u00a0\nreally wanted to try a new drugstore foundation\u00a0\num before before i went ahead and bought like um\u00a0\u00a0\nanother high-end one because i feel like drugstore\u00a0\nproducts are like just as good i really do\u00a0\u00a0\num and i used to get them all the time before\u00a0\nuntil like sephora took over my life and you know\u00a0\u00a0\nmade me like broke but no but i don't know\u00a0\nhow this color is oh it's too light great\ngreat i have to exchange this color now\nbut let's blend it out and see how\nokay\ni think it's still too light\u00a0\nthough but it'll work for today\nit has good coverage though\ni have a thin layer and it's doing\u00a0\na good job doing the covering\num it is kind of it dries real quick so you\u00a0\nhave to like i guess just blend as you go\u00a0\u00a0\ni wouldn't spread it out like how i did\nget some on the island um but i did get\u00a0\nsomething else to prime the eyelids with\u00a0\u00a0\num i have the juvia's place\nconcealer\none of these wand things and\u00a0\ni'm gonna use that as a primer\u00a0\u00a0\non my eyes can you guys hear that\u00a0\ni saw's blowing his nose so loud\ni feel like everyone's voices\u00a0\necho in my house like so much\u00a0\u00a0\nor everyone's just like super loud everyone\u00a0\nis really loud in my house well that's like\u00a0\u00a0\nreally light that concealer i actually got it\u00a0\nfor um brightening the under eye with like a\u00a0\u00a0\ntiny bit which i think it'll work but i think\u00a0\nfor on top of the eyelid this color is too light\nokay\nokay it looks like it's set\nnow let's see how it is with the creasing because\u00a0\nyou know my eyes are creasing all the time\u00a0\u00a0\nlike with just the concealer on um\u00a0\nbut i'm gonna go ahead and set this\u00a0\u00a0\nset the eyes a little bit with my magic\u00a0\npowder the sicily paris magic powder\u00a0\u00a0\nit's like super thin so it's just fine for\u00a0\nsetting the eyes real quick for priming\nokay so let's go right into our very first\u00a0\nproduct or no second product third product\u00a0\u00a0\noh okay so let's go right into our jaclyn\u00a0\nhill palette and let me show you how beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is isn't that gorgeous i love all\u00a0\nlike all of the colors i love all of them\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're so pretty um i'm gonna just grab\u00a0\na fluffy brush this is the morphe m518\u00a0\u00a0\njust a fluffy fluffers and brush actually no i'm\u00a0\ngonna get this fluffy brush that's the morphe g17\u00a0\u00a0\ni love this brush is one of my favorite\u00a0\nfavorite brushes just because it's so soft\u00a0\u00a0\num and it spreads out like your transition color\u00a0\nso beautifully um so today we are going to do\nokay let's just start with this\u00a0\ntransition color called perfectionist\u00a0\u00a0\nokay and we're gonna go right\u00a0\ninto our transition area\nlike that\nand again i say this all the time\u00a0\ndon't be afraid to commit to the color\u00a0\u00a0\nmake sure you that color\u00a0\nshows up as it's supposed to\nand there we go\num okay now i'm gonna go in with the same\u00a0\nfluffy brush and a darker shade called\ngrateful it's like a\ndusty kind of brownish orange shade\ni'm going right into the crease with that\nokay i have that color grateful all through the\u00a0\nlid in the crease and then now i'm gonna go in\u00a0\u00a0\nwith the color next it's like a raspberry color\u00a0\nand going right into the crease with that as well\nokay how's the lighting guys i added another light\u00a0\nto the whole situation um tell me what you think\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so i have the color next all\u00a0\nthroughout the eyelid i mean the crease\num make sure it's in\nokay\nand then i'm gonna go in with the color actually\u00a0\ni'm gonna like fix this a little bit more\nokay we have that in now i'm gonna actually\u00a0\njust use my fingers to use the color um bougie\nokay so we have the color next in our\u00a0\u00a0\ncrease and then now i'm going to go ahead with\u00a0\nthe color bougie and i want to use just my finger\nthat's pretty\ni love it\nand i'm gonna do all across my eyelids\nand let that transition at the very end\nlike that i love it i love all the colors\u00a0\nin this palette so pigmented of course um\u00a0\u00a0\nas most of all of morphe's palettes\u00a0\nare um and yeah and even these colors\u00a0\u00a0\nare just gorgeous um and i want to use the color\u00a0\u00a0\num actually you know there's no highlight\u00a0\ncolor in here so i'm gonna just use another um\nhighlight to highlight our\u00a0\nbrow bone before we go into our\nthe rest of the face so go\u00a0\nahead and highlight that\nlike that\ni didn't do my eyebrows yet so let's just\u00a0\ngo ahead and do that oh and then i got also\u00a0\u00a0\nthis nyx full and fluff um brow definer and it\u00a0\nactually so looks like the anastasia brow definer\u00a0\u00a0\num but it's next it's like you know a quarter\u00a0\nof the price so i figured let me try that except\u00a0\u00a0\nthe only thing is it doesn't have a spoolie at\u00a0\nthe other end it has like this little fluffing\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle fluffer thing which i honestly\u00a0\ndon't know if this is as you know\u00a0\u00a0\ngood as having a spoolie but let's try it out\nit's definitely pigmented\ni feel like it's a little bit more pigmented\u00a0\nand creamier than the anastasia one\nthat can be a good or a bad thing i think it's\u00a0\na good thing because i'm not too heavy-handed\u00a0\u00a0\nbut if you're heavy-handed with your\u00a0\neyebrows it could be a bad thing if\u00a0\u00a0\nyour product is a little too like intense\u00a0\nyou know but this is this is fine for me\u00a0\u00a0\noh it's okay the fluffing thing is just sorry i\u00a0\nhonestly need a spoolie i can't fluff my brows\nhow's the light guys\ni bought another light to add to make myself\u00a0\nbrighter what do you think how's it looking\ni actually really like this\u00a0\nbrow definer i think it's good\ni wonder if you'd go through it\u00a0\nfaster though because it is so creamy\u00a0\u00a0\nso you need a purchase you you'd need to purchase\u00a0\nit sooner than you would need to purchase the\u00a0\u00a0\nanastasia one so if you look at it that way but\u00a0\nit's still good it's still a good prop definer\nlike so and then i'm gonna actually go ahead with\u00a0\u00a0\nour concealer before we do our bottom lashes\u00a0\num so i'm gonna first use a little bit of\u00a0\u00a0\nthis juvia's place concealer in number 18.\u00a0\nso this is what i really wanted to try out to\u00a0\u00a0\ntheir concealer has like a paint smell i\u00a0\nhonestly don't mind smells i really don't um\ni'm gonna use that which is\u00a0\nvery close to my skin tone\u00a0\u00a0\nbut then i'm going to mix in a little\u00a0\nbit of a lighter color to brighten\nfor brightening effect i don't know\u00a0\nif that's going to be too much and\u00a0\u00a0\nthe lighter color is in color 21. so let's see\ni think i need to spray\nwell it's spreading around like beautifully\u00a0\nit's not like patchy or anything super creamy\ni think it just might be doing the job\nand use this opportunity to clean\u00a0\nout you know your eyeshadow from here\nthe kids are having a ball over there\nthe sound of kids laughing\u00a0\nin a house honestly it's like\u00a0\u00a0\ni feel like it's just a blessing in itself so\u00a0\ninstead of like i try to think of it like that\u00a0\u00a0\ninstead of like getting annoyed sometimes when\u00a0\nthey're just like won't you know i'm like you know\nwould i have it any other way i wouldn't so\nbut they can get so annoying\noh what happened here\nwhat happened right there\nthat was weird\nso that spread around beautifully um and i also\u00a0\ngot this nyx professional makeup brush and this\u00a0\u00a0\nis the brush number 22 and it's like this and i\u00a0\ngot it for setting my under eyes because it's like\u00a0\u00a0\nangles like this you know and it's like\u00a0\nperfect for like getting right in there\u00a0\u00a0\noh and i also picked up this brightening\u00a0\npowder by essence so i'm gonna set my\u00a0\u00a0\nunder eyes with this brightening powder\u00a0\nfirst before i go in with like my regular\nokay set that actually i'll set wherever i put i\u00a0\nput the concealer with this brightening powder i\u00a0\u00a0\njust want to see what it's going to look like\u00a0\nand then i'll set the rest of my face with um\u00a0\u00a0\nmy mac mineralized skin finish and medium golden\nthere's like fuzzies in my nose\nwhat's like the new hot powder out these days\u00a0\nlike setting powder is there something like new\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's like a must try um leave a comment\u00a0\ndown below let me know because i was out\u00a0\u00a0\nsearching for like a powder that was gonna be like\u00a0\nlife-changing but i was at the drugstore and i\u00a0\u00a0\ndidn't find anything so i just wonder if there's\u00a0\nsomething like high-end that i need to try um\nbut yeah let's do bottom lashes i'm\u00a0\ngonna grab another smaller like little um\npencil brush no i'm gonna grab a little\u00a0\ndetail brush like this this is just the\u00a0\u00a0\nanastasia brush that comes in the palette and\u00a0\ni use a smaller side i really like that side\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm gonna go in with that um color next\u00a0\nwith it which is that raspberry color right on\nright away on our outer\ntwo thirds of the eye\nokay\nokay like that and then i'm gonna clean off that\u00a0\nbrush and then i'm gonna blend that out with\u00a0\u00a0\nthe initial perfectionist color that we used\nand i want to actually mix\u00a0\nit with um the color grateful\nand i want to blend it out that way\nlike so and then i'm gonna take\u00a0\nanother um smaller fluffy brush\nyou can just find what i'm looking for okay\u00a0\nso i got this brush morphe m506 it's just\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a small really really small detailed\u00a0\nfluffy brush and i'm gonna just i just wanna\nblend that out a little bit more and\u00a0\nthere's no product on this brush guys\nlike so\nand i'm going to do a um\ni got this what is this\u00a0\u00a0\ni got this nyx eyeliner in brown and i'm\u00a0\ngoing to just use that in my inner waterline\nand i'm gonna tie line on top as well\nthat's annoying\noh you know don't mind just\u00a0\nthe husband in the bathroom\nthat's okay because we're\u00a0\ngonna go in with liner anyways\nlike so that was very unpleasant\num so we have tight lines and put the liner\u00a0\nin and i'm gonna go in straight with mascara\u00a0\u00a0\nactually no let's do our um liquid liner and i'm\u00a0\njust going to need another mirror for this okay\ncan you go see\ni don't feel like doing a long um ring today\u00a0\nso i'm just gonna keep it like rather short\ndo the other side i'll be right back\u00a0\nokay so i did liner on both sides and\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm gonna go in with mascara with\u00a0\nmy favorite l'oreal lash paradise\nyes\nbottom lashes\nand then and then my next item\u00a0\nthat um i'm super excited to try is\u00a0\u00a0\nthis kylie cosmetics um bronzer\u00a0\nand i got this in color 100 khaki\nthere's like not much pigment i\u00a0\nthought this would be like my shade\nthere is a very little pigment there\nit's like really light okay i need to\u00a0\ngo exchange this it's not working um\ni'm gonna use my nars bronzer in casino\nokay\nand you know how i like to just\u00a0\nput bronzer like everywhere\nso there's that\num then i'm gonna go ahead\u00a0\u00a0\nwith you know i want to do a little bit\u00a0\nmore of a contour so i'm going to use my\nanastasia bronzer and use\u00a0\na slightly different brush\nit's like a small kind of fluffy\u00a0\nbrush like that for the face\u00a0\u00a0\nand i want to do a little\u00a0\ncontour right here with that\nlike that\nlike that\ni never do a really precise\u00a0\nnose contour just because like\ni don't feel like i really need to on a\u00a0\nregular you know basis but when i do do it like\u00a0\u00a0\nprecisely it looks it looks really\u00a0\ngood um spun that out a little

consider\u00a0\nsubscribing so today i am going to be filming a\u00a0\u00a0\nfull face of first impressions well i\u00a0\nthink there's two things i haven't got i\u00a0\u00a0\nhaven't got a new foundation and highlighter but\u00a0\neverything else is going to be first impressions\u00a0\u00a0\ni've got quite a variety i've got a\u00a0\nnext brush set which is interesting and\ni don't know what this brand is kawabi um which\u00a0\ni got for christmas i got both of these for\u00a0\u00a0\nchristmas i've got the wonderlash primark mascara\u00a0\ni've got the barium euphoric liquid not liquid\u00a0\u00a0\nmetallic cream eyeshadow um i've got a couple of\u00a0\nshe glam i've got a she glam like mini palette and\u00a0\u00a0\neyeliner i've got the unicorn cosmetics the new\u00a0\nrussian lashes they look really nice actually the\u00a0\u00a0\njuvia's bronzer duo that's the one i featured in\u00a0\nthe super drug haul and also the lipstick the nyx\u00a0\u00a0\neyebrow pen and the the made by mitchell\u00a0\nblush and this one's in pink pink sugar\u00a0\u00a0\npeach sugar so yeah i've got quite a few bits\u00a0\nto try out so let's get stuck in oh my days i\u00a0\u00a0\nthink i live near an raf base and you can probably\u00a0\nwell i know you can because when i edit i can hear\u00a0\u00a0\nthe planes going over and i think they must be\u00a0\ndoing some kind of test run or something today\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause i have paused and restarted this video\u00a0\nmany times and they just keep going over so\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm really sorry if you can hear that in the\u00a0\nbackground but i'm not going to pause it anymore\nso let's carry on so the first item i'm\u00a0\ngoing on with is actually a primer well\u00a0\u00a0\nit's kind of it's called a tone up cream so\u00a0\nit's this one here the light on tone up cream\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is actually a korean product from bomb beauty\u00a0\u00a0\nthat one there i did actually review quite a few\u00a0\nof their products before but in the testing video\u00a0\u00a0\ni i completely forgot i had this and i did\u00a0\nmy foundation so i'm going to use this now\u00a0\u00a0\nso i think what this does is it's kind of like a\u00a0\nwhite cream so it gives like a really pale base\u00a0\u00a0\nand it's also got toning properties in it so we're\u00a0\ngoing to put this on as a primer and then i'm just\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to go on with my normal foundation as\u00a0\ni said i haven't got a new foundation today\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm actually i kind of go between foundations\u00a0\nbut i'm going on with the huda beauty and this\u00a0\u00a0\nis in toasted coconut 240 n so we'll pop this\u00a0\non first anyway so it's in like a squeezy tube\ni'll just start off with that much so it looks\u00a0\nlike that so it's it's basically a bit like a\u00a0\u00a0\nmoisturizer it doesn't have a smell yet texture\u00a0\nwise it is very much like a moisturizer would be\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm gonna pop this on my normal areas\u00a0\nthat i would it does look like it's got a\u00a0\u00a0\nslight iridescent glow going through it as well\u00a0\nright so i'm gonna rub this in with my hands\nokay so there's there's it on and i can say it\u00a0\ndoes seem like it has kind of blurred my pores\u00a0\u00a0\nquite a lot and it soaks in really quick\u00a0\nit does feel very kind of moisturizing\nyeah so far i actually quite like that especially\u00a0\nif it gives toning properties as well i'm all for\u00a0\u00a0\nthat right then so next i'm going on with my\u00a0\nfoundation so as i say it's the huda beauty\u00a0\u00a0\nstick foundation that i have used before many\u00a0\ntimes however i am going to do it on camera\u00a0\u00a0\ntoday because i have this brush so this is the\u00a0\nkawabi i think it's kawabi confidence and beauty\u00a0\u00a0\nand this is a like a flat foundation brush es01\u00a0\nso it looks like this very kind of uh matte black\u00a0\u00a0\nand sleek oh it says zamira i don't know if that's\u00a0\nlike the name of their collection that they do or\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething it feels very soft and yeah it does\u00a0\nactually feel quite nice quality nylon hairs\ndon't seem to have any coming off so that's good\u00a0\u00a0\nright so i'm going to put\u00a0\nmy foundation on with this\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so yeah i'd say that's a pretty good\u00a0\nbrush yeah really nice it didn't like leave\u00a0\u00a0\nany hairs on my face anywhere so it's decent\u00a0\nquality and yeah it just blended really nicely\u00a0\u00a0\ni was a bit dubious because it is so\u00a0\nsoft and i normally like quite a dense\u00a0\u00a0\na dense brush to blend my foundation in but\u00a0\ni have to say that that worked really well\u00a0\u00a0\ni've just quickly gone off camera and\u00a0\ndone all i don't really use concealer\u00a0\u00a0\nso that's why i'm not reviewing any all i really\u00a0\ndo is put a couple of tiny dots under my eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nand i use the revolut revolution\u00a0\neyebright concealer in light i think it is\ni think it's light and the be perfect\u00a0\neye base i just pop that on my lids as\u00a0\u00a0\nwell right so next i'll do my brows and as i\u00a0\nsay i have the nyx lift and snatch brow pen\u00a0\u00a0\nso it is this one here now i\u00a0\ndo normally use a brow pen for\u00a0\u00a0\nmy brows i have been using the ardell\u00a0\none which i actually really really like\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i heard really good things about this and\u00a0\nit was just a little bit more easily accessible\u00a0\u00a0\nso i thought i'd i'd try it out so this one is\u00a0\nin the shade ash brown so it looks like this\nand then it has a tiny little skinny nib just like\u00a0\nthis it looks a lot lot similar to the other one\u00a0\u00a0\nactually but i will say that this one's got a\u00a0\ncan you hear that it's got like a little ball\u00a0\u00a0\ntype thing in it and the other one didn't and\u00a0\ni did find i had to kind of really shake it\u00a0\u00a0\nto uh to get the product out especially towards\u00a0\nwhen it was running out whereas this one doesn't\u00a0\u00a0\ndo that and the other one as well because you\u00a0\nhad to shake it so vigorously it's got one of\u00a0\u00a0\nthose kind of like springy pumps in it as well\u00a0\nyou know with the um the product in the lid which\u00a0\u00a0\nis really good the other one didn't have that i\u00a0\nthink it was just like a normal felt tip pen you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow where you have the the product in here and\u00a0\nthen you have to kind of shake it a bit like a\u00a0\u00a0\npermanent marker or something and it did dry out\u00a0\nquite quick and then because you had to shake it\u00a0\u00a0\nso hard a lot of the product when you opened it\u00a0\nwas was kind of like around the nib but that's\u00a0\u00a0\nfine it's a good product the ardell one this is\u00a0\nuh but yeah it'd be interesting to see if this\u00a0\u00a0\none's any better so i'm going to start off this is\u00a0\njust a regular spoolie i'm just going to give them\u00a0\u00a0\na quick brush through they seriously need doing\u00a0\nlook how pale they are you can barely see them\u00a0\u00a0\nright so a quick brush through\u00a0\nand then we'll try this pen\nthat is beautifully fine really really nice\nso that's all i do underneath i kind of just like\u00a0\nmark where i want my brow to be and then go up\nso like that and i think that is really really\u00a0\ngood i actually prefer that to the ardell one\u00a0\u00a0\nif i'm honest it didn't dry out as quick with the\u00a0\nother one i could literally just use that straight\u00a0\u00a0\naway and i didn't have to keep dipping in\u00a0\nor anything the nib didn't dry out at all\u00a0\u00a0\nand yeah i'm actually really happy\u00a0\nwith it i like the color as well\u00a0\u00a0\nso just give them a quick brush through again\nand yeah i'm really happy with that that'll be a\u00a0\ndefinite swap i think for me so next we'll go with\u00a0\u00a0\neyeshadow so i'm going in with the she glam glam\u00a0\n101 eyeshadow palette this is actually quite heavy\u00a0\u00a0\nfor a little palette and this is the so sublime\u00a0\npalette so that's what the palette itself looks\u00a0\u00a0\nlike so yeah nice colors we've got there's only\u00a0\nfive in here but they are quite nice sort of big\u00a0\u00a0\nsquarish rectangle pans a bit like the size of the\u00a0\nmaybe slightly smaller than the beauty bay ones\u00a0\u00a0\nbut we have a really nice kind of well we've\u00a0\ngot three mattes and two shimmers so that's\u00a0\u00a0\njust perfect really isn't it i'll give them a\u00a0\nquick swatch for you so here's what the swatches\u00a0\u00a0\nlook like really nice really nice beautiful\u00a0\npigment they feel lovely quality eyeshadows\u00a0\u00a0\nthat yellow look at that i've been looking for\u00a0\na decent yellow for a while like a matte yellow\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah really nice so then i also have\u00a0\nthis to use with it so this is the barium\u00a0\u00a0\neuphoric metallic cream eyeshadow in the\u00a0\nshade honored so it looks like this in the pot\u00a0\u00a0\noh oh it's very spongy like really really creamy\u00a0\nit's almost mousse like i wasn't expecting that at\u00a0\u00a0\nall i don't know what i was expecting to be honest\u00a0\nbut not that um so i'll just pop a bit here yes\u00a0\u00a0\nit's kind of like a a bronzy gold color so we're\u00a0\nlooking at that i've got a feeling a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nof this goes a long way so i'm going to start off\u00a0\nby doing my eye shadow so i'm going to go into my\u00a0\u00a0\ncrease to begin with using i think i'm going to go\u00a0\nin with the brown one the one on the end just here\nthat has got some serious pigment\u00a0\nin it it's really really nice\u00a0\u00a0\nright so i'm just going to blend\u00a0\nthat out using a clean brush\nyeah i think that's blended\u00a0\nout quite nicely actually\u00a0\u00a0\nokay and then on the outer part here and just\u00a0\nin my crease again kind of just below where\u00a0\u00a0\ni've put the brown i'm gonna go in with the dark\u00a0\ngreen one from the middle i've tried sometimes\u00a0\u00a0\nbut you're making me nervous now i've realized\u00a0\nthat i can't live without you all my friends\u00a0\u00a0\nthe only reason i keep\u00a0\nsneaking out at night tonight\nokay and i think that's really nice as\u00a0\nwell that's blended lovely into that brown\u00a0\u00a0\nshade yeah i'm happy with that right so on the\u00a0\ninner part here i think i'm going to go on with\u00a0\u00a0\ni was going to go in with that green i\u00a0\nwas actually going to use the i should\u00a0\u00a0\nput my finger in it the green and the orangey\u00a0\nshade but i do want to use this one as well\u00a0\u00a0\noh do you know what i'm gonna do the the green\u00a0\nand then i'm gonna use this one with it because it\u00a0\u00a0\ni think it'll still go with the look and i think\u00a0\nit'll go into the green quite nicely so i'm going\u00a0\u00a0\nto start off by using the the green shimmer shade\u00a0\nso this one here and i'm going to apply that to\u00a0\u00a0\nwhere i've got this gap here and then from the the\u00a0\nnext brush set i'm gonna use the eyeshadow brush\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's in there so it's like a just a flat\u00a0\nbrush these feel really really nice quality\u00a0\u00a0\ni love this um kind of matte like blush pink\u00a0\non here and this rose gold just here and i\u00a0\u00a0\nhave to say they do feel really nice quality\u00a0\nbrushes right so we're going with the green\noh look at that bearing in mind\u00a0\ni've put that on with a brush\u00a0\u00a0\ni don't know if this is the brush or the\u00a0\neye shadow but something's working right\noh yes i love that color that is so nice yeah and\u00a0\nas i say it went on super super well with a brush\u00a0\u00a0\nokay yeah god do you know what this little palette\u00a0\u00a0\nis brilliant really really good i can't remember\u00a0\nhow much it was i bought it a while ago now\u00a0\u00a0\nbut it is so good right so underneath i'm\u00a0\ngonna go with the brown again so this one here\u00a0\u00a0\nright and then i think on my kind of on my\u00a0\ncenter so where the the green shimmer joins the\u00a0\u00a0\ndarker green i'm going to go in with this cream\u00a0\neyeshadow which i'm actually quite nervous about\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm not going to lie because it's it's different\u00a0\nand i'm a bit out of my comfort zone with this\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm going to take a little bit and i'm going\u00a0\nto pop it on the back of my hand because i don't\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to take too much product and i'm just going\u00a0\nto use my finger oh god and then kind of pat it\nis that going on\na little bit do you know what that's not as\u00a0\nuh as dark or gold as i thought it was going\u00a0\u00a0\nto be right i think i'm going to try with\u00a0\na brush then so i'm going in with a another\u00a0\u00a0\nflat brush like this a little bit smaller\u00a0\nthan the one i used for the green shimmer\nit's weird right and\nthen okay let's try it with this\nlooks a bit blocky at the minute let's\u00a0\ntry and blend it out a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nthe only reason i keep sneaking out at night\nright okay now i've played around with it a bit\u00a0\ni mean it's not as vibrant as i thought it was\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to be if i'm honest although i do quite\u00a0\nthe work like the way that it layers over the\u00a0\u00a0\nshadow being obviously a cream product over a\u00a0\npowder i did wonder but it has actually gone\u00a0\u00a0\nquite well if you work with it a bit when i first\u00a0\nput it on i was like oh i don't know about this\u00a0\u00a0\nbut then once you work with it a little bit and\u00a0\nkind of blend and then blend the other colors back\u00a0\u00a0\ninto it it actually does work fairly well yeah so\u00a0\nobviously that's the one that i've done without\u00a0\u00a0\nit and that's with so i like both looks\u00a0\ni do prefer this one if i'm honest but\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah that one does look yeah it looks alright\u00a0\nso i just went on with my by terry highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\nso it's that one there in the center and i just\u00a0\nuse that on my inner corners and brow bone as well\u00a0\u00a0\nright so next i'm going to use eyeliner not the\u00a0\nbest eyeliner if you've seen my videos before\u00a0\u00a0\nyou'll know that but i'm always willing to give\u00a0\nthings a try so right this is the do it all two\u00a0\u00a0\nin one eyeliner also from she glam oh that's funky\u00a0\nso the packaging looks like this i think that's\u00a0\u00a0\nreally cool so on one end it has like an eraser\u00a0\nwhich is like this so obviously to clean up any\u00a0\u00a0\nmistakes for me very handy on the other end\u00a0\nwhat on earth what is that we've got this\noh i don't know about this i find normal\u00a0\neyeliner hard enough oh well you never know\u00a0\u00a0\nyou never know i like to keep an open mind on\u00a0\nthese things it might make it easier right okay\u00a0\u00a0\noh god i'm even more nervous now i\u00a0\nalways get nervous doing eyeliner right\nit's it's bled a little bit around the\u00a0\nedges i don't know if you can forget as\u00a0\u00a0\nclose as i can if you can see\u00a0\nit has bled around the edges\u00a0\u00a0\nit is quite hard to use as i say i'm not the best\u00a0\nperson at testing like eyeliner as such because it\u00a0\u00a0\nis not my strong point at all as you can tell but\u00a0\num yeah i think i'm gonna have to take a normal\u00a0\u00a0\none with a normal nib and just just clean that up\u00a0\na little bit as in you know make it a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nmore precise but saying that the fact that it's\u00a0\ngot that straight edge on it which i was like\u00a0\u00a0\num actually makes it a little bit\u00a0\nmore easy to get your your wing so\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah right what i'm going to do is just repeat\u00a0\nwhat i've done on this eye on this side just\u00a0\u00a0\nto get them even and neaten them up with a my\u00a0\nnormal pen that i use which is also a she glam one\u00a0\u00a0\nactually uh yeah what i'll do as well so we can\u00a0\ntest the uh the eraser let's do a bit on my hand\u00a0\u00a0\nright so there we go there's a line\u00a0\non my hand and then we use the eraser\nwhich does kind of take it off quite well the\u00a0\nonly thing is it's like this yeah it kind of it\u00a0\u00a0\ndoes stain the end a bit but do you remember at\u00a0\nschool you used to have those like magic markers\u00a0\u00a0\nit reminds me of that and i remember that the\u00a0\nmagic markers used to stain really easy but then\u00a0\u00a0\nafter a while because obviously it's got this\u00a0\nkind of like i don't know color dissolver or\u00a0\u00a0\nwhatever it is in it it used to like work\u00a0\nand you'd open it again and it'd be white\u00a0\u00a0\nagain maybe that happens i don't know but yeah\u00a0\nin all honesty that's a bit of a miss for me\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich is a shame because i was quite looking\u00a0\nforward to that but it's just just the shape of\u00a0\u00a0\nit i just don't get on with it some people might\u00a0\ndo some people might think it's amazing but for me\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah it's not for me okay so that's how it's\u00a0\nlooking with like i've gone over it with my my\u00a0\u00a0\nnormal liner afterwards it's not too bad actually\u00a0\nfor me that's a good eyeliner day this one yeah\u00a0\u00a0\nbut this one's all right that's my thing\u00a0\ni can never get them even right so next\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm gonna go with mascara so it's this one here\u00a0\nso it's the ps wonderlash mascara from primark\u00a0\u00a0\nand apparently this one is very much like\u00a0\nthe benefit they're real so the packaging\u00a0\u00a0\nlooks like this and the wand is like this\u00a0\nso it's a very kind of a dense plastic wand\noh i like that so that's how it look that's only\u00a0\none coat i think that's really nice it is quite\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of gives that almost clumpy loop in a good\u00a0\nway it doesn't look like you know spider lashes\u00a0\u00a0\nor anything but yeah i think that's nice oh\u00a0\nyeah yeah i'm a big fan of that three quid\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's all that was three quid and do\u00a0\nyou know what the the one that i was\u00a0\u00a0\nloving before that was the the maybelline sky high\u00a0\nwhich obviously a lot of people are quite a fan of\u00a0\u00a0\nand this i would say is better in my opinion i\u00a0\ni think that's brilliant absolutely brilliant\u00a0\u00a0\nright so lashes i've got the unicorn cosmetics\u00a0\nthese are the russian volume lashes i love these\u00a0\u00a0\ni think these look absolutely gorgeous so we're\u00a0\ngoing to pop these on so this is what they look\u00a0\u00a0\nlike close up so they've got a really lovely curl\u00a0\non them yeah these look nice oh no no they're not\u00a0\u00a0\nfor me when they're on oh stuck there when they're\u00a0\non they're all no they're a bit too curly for me\u00a0\u00a0\ni know russian lashes do have a curl i i actually\u00a0\ndo them um i normally use a decal on them and yeah\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're just a little bit they're a bit too much\u00a0\nfor me if i'm honest yeah i think i'm gonna change\u00a0\u00a0\nthem eight so i've gone with these ones these\u00a0\nare just some some cheap ones from from shein\u00a0\u00a0\nso for bronzer i'm going in with the juvia's place\u00a0\nbronzed in medium i got this from superdrug i i\u00a0\u00a0\nfeatured this in my last superdrug haul and yet\u00a0\ni've i've wanted to get hold of juvias for so long\u00a0\u00a0\ni used to buy it from beauty bay and then they\u00a0\nstopped selling it i don't know why but they did\u00a0\u00a0\nand ever since then it's been really really hard\u00a0\nto get hold of in the uk so when i went to uh\u00a0\u00a0\nsuperdrug just for some hair stuff and i saw that\u00a0\nthey had a juvia's place stand that apparently\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen on sale that day that i went in talk about\u00a0\nright place right time and yeah i picked up the\u00a0\u00a0\nbronzer and lipstick right so they look like this\u00a0\nit does look quite dark in the pan but this is\u00a0\u00a0\nthe lightest shade that they do and actually when\u00a0\nyou swatch it you've kind of got a cool and a warm\u00a0\u00a0\ntoned bronzer and they actually don't look half\u00a0\nbad at all i really like juvia's products so yeah\u00a0\u00a0\nas i say you've got like yeah you're more warm\u00a0\ntone here and your slightly cooler one just here i\u00a0\u00a0\nthink i'm gonna go with the warmer one i know that\u00a0\nyou're probably supposed to use the cool one for\u00a0\u00a0\num contouring and the warm one for bronzing but\u00a0\ni'm just gonna go with with bronzer to be honest\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm gonna use this brush from the next set as well\u00a0\nthis feels really really lovely too and i'm going\u00a0\u00a0\nin cool it's pigmented very very very pigmented\u00a0\nright let's tap a bit off see how we get on\nthat's actually really quite nice\u00a0\u00a0\ni actually really really like that i think that\u00a0\nis beautiful really nice it's not too dark at all\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah so don't be scared by it only being a medium\u00a0\nif you're if you're a very fair skin tankers\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause i am and i don't think that that looks too\u00a0\ndark whatsoever i think it's quite nice actually\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah i'm really pleased with that so for blush i\u00a0\nam going in with the made by mitchell blush and\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one is in peach sugar and this is a cream\u00a0\nblush so looks like this i'm sure that you've\u00a0\u00a0\nseen these before they've been around a while\u00a0\nnow but i've only just got around to buying one\u00a0\u00a0\nright so i have a she glam blush that i normally\u00a0\nuse regularly so i'm going to apply it in the\u00a0\u00a0\nsame way as that which is i normally just dot\u00a0\nit on and then pat it in with my finger and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen i finish it off with a brush i'm going\u00a0\nto use the last one from the next set which\u00a0\u00a0\nis this angled kind of contour brush there is\u00a0\na flat foundation brush but i don't use these\u00a0\u00a0\ni i use it's dusty i use the um the one that i did\u00a0\nuse you know the the flat headed ones so i'm going\u00a0\u00a0\nto use this for a face mask but we're going in\u00a0\nwith this one for the blush it's kind of like this\nit's thicker than the the she in one actually i'm\u00a0\ngonna take it what i normally would just pat it in\ni really like that that is nice\nit kind of reminds me of the consistency\u00a0\nof a matte liquid lipstick which is nice\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause it obviously dries down quite matte\u00a0\nas well which i do i do quite like actually\nyeah i really like that that is really really\u00a0\nnice really nice so i don't have a highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm just gonna go in with the by terry one\u00a0\nthis is the the one that i used on my inner\u00a0\u00a0\ncorners and brow bone this is the beige nude\u00a0\ncompact expert dual powder so i'm just going\u00a0\u00a0\nto go on with this one quickly right so next\u00a0\ni'm going to go in with lipstick so it's the\u00a0\u00a0\ndubious place the nudes chocolate this is the\u00a0\nvelvety matte lipstick in toffee so that's the\u00a0\u00a0\npackaging and then that's what the lipstick looks\u00a0\nlike very very pretty i love the smell of this\u00a0\u00a0\nand then that's what it's like so it's a\u00a0\nreally lovely brown shade like a nude brown\u00a0\u00a0\ni love colors like this in the winter so what\u00a0\ni'm going to do is just line my lips first i'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing in with the doll beauty lip liner it's\u00a0\nnot new but this is in the shade princess\u00a0\u00a0\ni love that color that is so nice it's\u00a0\nactually a bit paler than i thought\u00a0\u00a0\nit was going to be if i'm honest that's why i went\u00a0\nfor the darker lip liner so that's what it's like\u00a0\u00a0\non i think it's really and it really took me by\u00a0\nsurprise i thought it was going to be more matte\u00a0\u00a0\nbut it goes on it's so nice to put on it\u00a0\nreally glides it's a beautiful lipstick but\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah i really like the color don't get me wrong\u00a0\nbut i was not expecting it to be this light\u00a0\u00a0\ni thought it was going to be quite a dark\u00a0\nbrown a bit like the um the twirl from mac\u00a0\u00a0\nbut no i love that i think it's gorgeous it's\u00a0\nreally nice with the green eyeshadow as well\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is the finished look and i love it i i\u00a0\nreally do i love this eye shadow that shimmer\u00a0\u00a0\nthat shimmery green is stunning absolutely love\u00a0\nthat this little palette i can't remember i think\u00a0\u00a0\ni said before i can't remember how much it was\u00a0\ni'm sure it was only about three or four quid\u00a0\u00a0\nbut that is such a good palette they had different\u00a0\nones as well in different colors which i might try\u00a0\u00a0\nand get hold of but oh i'm a massive fan of that\u00a0\ni love to be honest i loved everything i love the\u00a0\u00a0\nblush i love the bronzer the lipstick the eyebrow\u00a0\npen yeah the only thing i wasn't so keen on was\u00a0\u00a0\nthe eyeliner but yeah everything else is is really\u00a0\ngood yeah super happy so here's a quick close-up\u00a0\u00a0\nof the eyes for you yeah i love that she shimmery\u00a0\ngreen i think it is stunning really really nice\u00a0\u00a0\nand i think the eyeliner actually went reasonably\u00a0\nwell today which is uh quite good for me\noh the lashes i forgot about them yeah\u00a0\ni wasn't skiing on the lashes either\u00a0\u00a0\nthe lashes themselves i love unicorn lashes so\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know don't get me wrong i love their lashes\u00a0\njust that style in particular wasn't really for me\u00a0\u00a0\num yeah but oh and i've got to say that the barium\u00a0\num cream eyeshadow now it's dried down i actually\u00a0\u00a0\nquite like it i wasn't sure to start off with but\u00a0\nyeah

        "transcript_text": "Hello, I'm Guppy Mom\nToday I brought two beauty tools.\nYou really need a lot of beauty accessories,\nand the products that I feel a lot of need these days\nare a tool that can be used easily\nwhen cleaning brushes, and then a lip brush.\nIt's not just a regular lip brush,\nbut that can smudge the lip line \nand blur it,\nsomething like a finger tip, instead of fingers?\nI need that kind of a thing\nSo, I chose this product.\nNow, both of them are Fillimilli products.\nTheir brushes are famous.\nIt seems to be a brand that appeared a few years ago,\nbut it's still very usable\nand the product quality is good for the price,\nand I have their brush as well, \nalso other props came out so I bought them, too.\nNow, let's see what they are.\nYou can dust off your brush here,\nand it's used to wash the brush off afterwards.\nI'll open it.\nI think it's made of silicone.\nDual Makeup Brush Cleaner\nThis looks a bit like a lid,\nbut wouldn't it be okay to store it like this?\nIt says 'Fillimilli' here,\nusually it can be used as a lid,\nthen open \nlet's say I did my eye makeup with eye shadow,\nthen the shadow color remains on the brush like this.\nThen when I use another color again, this color remains,\nso I used to wipe it with toilet tissue, but that's not good,\nso I should dust off my brush here.\nHere, on this sponge,\nit's kind of like loofahs\nan entangled sponge.\nI rubbed it like this once here...\nWow~ I was so good at buying this.\nCan you see it, right?\nIt falls off right away Just like this\nI'm not sure what color this brush has right now,\nIt looks like there's something on it, but it's not serious.\nand it's cleaned when I brush it off here like this.\nWow, it's being robbed right away.\nIf you don't know this and apply it over\nand over again as it is,\nit's really a bit unsanitary.\nand the colors are mixed, so you can get a different color.\nThis is so good\nComparing to rubbing it on a tissue,\nit's on another level.\nIf you do this on toilet paper,\nit won't come out all the way.\nIt's been brushed off a lot right now,\nbut since I'm doing it here,\nit's cleaned up right away\nso this is a very creative product.\nI think it's already cleaned.\nAfter that, if you use this several times, \nthe bacteria can grow due to the oiliness.\nIn such a case, if you dip the washing liquid in it and roll it like this\non this part protruding erratically like this,\nif you roll it around like this,\nThis cleanser removes all the colors and it cleanses evenly.\nI bought that washing liquid,\nso I'm going to try it soon,\nand I turn it upside down like this\nand it's like a washboard.\nHere, you can rub it like this and wash the brush.\nI was curious, so I looked it up and found out how to use it.\nHere, where you brush it off.\nShaking it off and wash it here,\nwash it like this,\nand then roll it like this,\nI guess that's how you do it.\nI'm so glad that I bought this.\nIf you look behind this, Fillimilli Dual Make Up Brush Cleaner\nShake it off on the sponge.\nAnd then wash it on the washboard \nlike I said before.\nFor thicker foundation brushes, \nyou need to wash them often. Right?\nYou wash it here\nand then\nalso in here\nafter using it, put the lid on when you store it.\nTa-dah~\nIt's a very useful product,\nThose who need it, just try it.\nOkay, this was very good.\nNext, I'll try this brush,\nlet's try this lip brush.\nThis lip brush is smaller than I thought.\nIt's called a portable wide lip brush,\nbut the size is ust slightly longer than my fingers\nPalm size? Like this?\nBut the small size is good for carrying around.\nRather than a bigger one.\nIt has a lid inside.\nI don't know what this rubber is for.\nAnyway, you can\n put it in the lid and carry it around.\nWhen it gets in like this, \nthe lid hold it nice and tight so it doesn't open,\nand it feels soft. \nI think the design is so pretty.\nhey take a look, it's a little bit strong and firm,\nit's hard and flat short fur.\nIt is really flat and here, it is a slightly \nIt's not completely round and it's flat slightly.\nThen I'll apply lipstick\nlike this,\nand after applying this,\nI will blur it once more.\nYes, the blurring works well,\nit works subtly\nHere, I applied 1, 2, 3, \nand I'm blurring now.\nI think the fur is softer than I thought.\nAlthough it has a bit hard so you need to adjusted a bit,\nbut it blurs well.\nMake up your lip line with this, \ntap, tap, tap, and wrap it up\nI think a darker color will appear better than this one.\nI bought this to use when I don't want to use my fingers.\nI don't like getting my fingers stained\nThere are a lot of tinted products these days,\nand I don't like it when my fingers get colored.\nSo I think it'd be good to blur it with a brush.\nIt doesn't get colored that much so it's fine.\nOkay, I introduced some beauty tools today.\nIt was the dual makeup\nbrush cleaner that is easy to use,\nand then the portable wide lip brush.\nWell, that's it for today.\nI'm Guppy Mom\nand see you next time~~",

um\ni have thoughts i have thoughts i feel\u00a0\nlike i'm already tired of this collection\u00a0\u00a0\nand i haven't even tried it yet like these are\u00a0\ntotally untouched i haven't even swatched them\u00a0\u00a0\nbut we're gonna try them out um and i'm gonna\u00a0\nlet you know how i feel i guess but yeah i've um\u00a0\u00a0\ni have a lot of thoughts i have a lot of thoughts\u00a0\nand if you haven't been in before this is the\u00a0\u00a0\nfirst video here hello my name is andy i'm such\u00a0\na lover beauty makeup i love everything beauty\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup related so i'm sure i will enjoy it but i\u00a0\nwill let you know throughout this video why i'm\u00a0\u00a0\njust a little bit disappointed about this\u00a0\nrelease and why i'm not as smitten with it\u00a0\u00a0\nnow that i'm holding it as i thought it\u00a0\nwould be but if you want to see some more\u00a0\u00a0\nbeauty videos don't forget to subscribe\u00a0\nbecause i do upload quite a lot of videos\ni'm going to start with the blush palette i think\u00a0\nthis one is the divine blush and glow trio love\u00a0\u00a0\nat first blush i mean this is cute this is really\u00a0\ncute i like the periwinkle packaging i was trying\u00a0\u00a0\nto match my background with the packaging really\u00a0\nlike that this is two blushes and a highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\nand all three of these are already existing shades\u00a0\nbut i didn't have any of these shades these are\u00a0\u00a0\ncherish nymphat and venus nectar and i didn't\u00a0\nhave any of these shades i thought for me it was\u00a0\u00a0\na good purchase to buy these it is a matte blush\u00a0\na shimmery blush and a highlighter i am going to\u00a0\u00a0\nuse this shimmery blush wait let me get some let\u00a0\nme get some brushes i am going to be like i said\u00a0\u00a0\nusing this shimmery blush the one in the middle\u00a0\nand i think i'm going to use because i have the\u00a0\u00a0\nother highlighter let me talk about this you're\u00a0\nprobably so sick and tired of hearing about this\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so here's the thing i bought this\u00a0\nrelease is this brush not picking this up\noh i bought this release on release i bought\u00a0\nthis at launch day which was december 26th\u00a0\u00a0\ndecember 26th you realize like i'm filming this on\u00a0\njanuary 25th that is the day that i'm filming this\u00a0\u00a0\nand i did get this release some time ago\u00a0\nbut the reason why i'm filming so late\u00a0\u00a0\nis that it took them forever to ship this\u00a0\nlike i'm not the kind of person like listen\u00a0\u00a0\ni used to live in sweden i just moved to austin\u00a0\ntexas i'm used to things taking a little time\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is a really beautiful blush i'm used to\u00a0\nthings taking a little bit time to get to me\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm not that person that's going to be like\u00a0\nwhy is it taking so long but here's the thing\u00a0\u00a0\nit isn't the shipping that took time i don't\u00a0\nwant to use this highlighter although this looks\u00a0\u00a0\nreally pretty maybe i'll use this one on\u00a0\none cheek and i use the other one i want\u00a0\u00a0\nyou i'm not the person that complains about\u00a0\nshipping i know that shipping takes time\u00a0\u00a0\noh okay okay this one is even more it has a little\u00a0\nof like visible sparkle in it it's more like a\u00a0\u00a0\nfoil metallic yeah you can see the difference and\u00a0\nthis one has more of a peachy pink undertone and\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one is like almost like a whitish gold i\u00a0\nthink i will like both of these i'm gonna be\u00a0\u00a0\nhonest i think i would like both of them i'll use\u00a0\none on each cheek and then i'll just even it out\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is the one i'll start with the one in\u00a0\nthis one the the trio but the thing is with\u00a0\u00a0\nthis release what took so long was the handling\u00a0\nlike it took them two weeks or maybe even more\u00a0\u00a0\nto even ship out the products and i think that\u00a0\nthat is absolutely unacceptable and i know that\u00a0\u00a0\nit's not just my order because sometimes it's like\u00a0\noh it's just my order maybe i maybe i got to be\u00a0\u00a0\nthe last one bummer because that has happened to\u00a0\nme before as well especially with international\u00a0\u00a0\norders even though i shipped this one to a us\u00a0\naddress so this one wasn't shipped internationally\u00a0\u00a0\nthis was shipped to u.s address so it's sometimes\u00a0\ni'm like oh bummer i'm the last one like\u00a0\u00a0\nsucks to be me like sucks to be me but now i'm\u00a0\nusing the other one but this time it seemed to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe oh it seemed to be everyone no one was getting\u00a0\na video up i wasn't seeing any instagram pictures\u00a0\u00a0\nand i knew so many people have bought it and\u00a0\nit seemed like this was just a big problem\u00a0\u00a0\nfor a lot of people so many people were asking\u00a0\nme did you get your stuff hasn't been shipped\u00a0\u00a0\nyet because they were saying that their stuff\u00a0\nhadn't been shipped so for some reason pamogran\u00a0\u00a0\nokay i like both of them this is a little warmer\u00a0\nand peachier it fits me a little better i'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nsee if i can like just mix them so it seems like\u00a0\npat mcgrath was selling this collection before\u00a0\u00a0\nshe was ready to ship it i'm gonna be honest\u00a0\nit does seem like that because it's not like oh\u00a0\u00a0\nsome people got it later a lot of people got it\u00a0\nlater like most people got it later did anyone\u00a0\u00a0\nget it within a reasonable amount of time\u00a0\ni don't think that i don't think that two\u00a0\u00a0\nweeks shipping is a reasonable amount of time it\u00a0\nshould not take two weeks to ship something out\u00a0\u00a0\nif it's not a pre like a pre-sale and that's why\u00a0\ni'm thinking it is beautiful though like this is\u00a0\u00a0\nlooking this is looking stunning i'm i'm happy\u00a0\nwith how this looks it looks really beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nif it's a pre-sale it needs to say it on the site\u00a0\nlike is it a pre-sale because it sure seems like\u00a0\u00a0\nit's a pre-sale when you're not shipping it out\u00a0\nfor two weeks so it makes me think that maybe\u00a0\u00a0\nthey had okay so this is the palette this is the\u00a0\npalette i mean it looks cute i will say that mine\u00a0\u00a0\nhas a couple of scratches on this can you see like\u00a0\nthere's a couple of scratches and like marks on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe black inside my palette and i haven't used it\u00a0\nand it's just like it just makes it look a little\u00a0\u00a0\ni don't know and also this picture here it's\u00a0\nlike pixelated almost it's like i don't this\u00a0\u00a0\nis just me being naggy this is me being naggy but\u00a0\nthis is an expensive collection and i'm expecting\u00a0\u00a0\nthe whole experience and maybe that's\u00a0\nwhy i'm nagging a bit if you're paying\u00a0\u00a0\nluxury prices you should be getting the\u00a0\nluxury experience being on the website\u00a0\u00a0\nshopping shipping receiving unpacking\u00a0\nthe whole packaging and the feel of it\u00a0\u00a0\npresentation all of it should be a plus nothing\u00a0\ncould be like a c minus when you're playing\u00a0\u00a0\nthis price tag that is just my opinion i'm\u00a0\ngonna put on some eye primer and we can do\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat are we gonna do this blue here it is like oh\u00a0\nyou can see it's like really catching the light\u00a0\u00a0\nit is like a gray with a periwinkle shift to\u00a0\nit but i mean i guess we're doing something\u00a0\u00a0\nrandom it's i mean obviously i'm doing\u00a0\nsomething with the blue it's like who i am\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i think i'm going to start with this red\u00a0\none here and maybe i'll do like something of a\u00a0\u00a0\nhalo situation i think i remembered i wanted to\u00a0\nuse these new brushes by makeup geek these have\u00a0\u00a0\njust released this one looks amazing this is the\u00a0\ndefined crease brush it is so small and beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\ni think i'm gonna start with this is called outer\u00a0\nbrush outer v brush i like when brushes like\u00a0\u00a0\ngive you examples of how to use them because i\u00a0\nreally feel like it helps if you're a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nunsure of like where and how to use your brushes\u00a0\nand then of course like you can use your brushes\u00a0\u00a0\nanywhere you want but it's always nice to get\u00a0\na little hint in case you are a bit unsure so\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm using the shade the red one here i think\u00a0\nit is like a little bit of a baked satin shade\u00a0\u00a0\nit picks up really beautiful oh that's that's\u00a0\nreally nice so let me use some of that here okay\u00a0\u00a0\nso i just i don't know the whole thing of me like\u00a0\nwaiting for two weeks until it shipped and then\u00a0\u00a0\nwaiting for one more week until it got here and\u00a0\nthe website not saying that it was a pre-sale\u00a0\u00a0\ni just it just felt very unluxurious and then\u00a0\ngetting the package noting that there was a like\u00a0\u00a0\na couple of scratches on it some of the pictures\u00a0\nseemed to be a little bit like low resolution\u00a0\u00a0\ni don't know it just left me feeling like it\u00a0\nwasn't an ex like the luxurious experience\u00a0\u00a0\nthat i was hoping it was going to be but i\u00a0\nwill say everything is performing beautifully\u00a0\u00a0\nlike i'm really liking how that is looking\u00a0\nit is i would say that this is i mean it is\u00a0\u00a0\nit has a little bit of a sheen to it\u00a0\nbut i wouldn't this is definitely not a\u00a0\u00a0\nshimmer i would say that this is a matte with a\u00a0\nslight sheen but i realize that other people might\u00a0\u00a0\nlike categorize it a little bit different remember\u00a0\nto pat out your primer if you get in the crease\u00a0\u00a0\nbefore going in with eyeshadows especially like\u00a0\nfor me i get like my eyeshadow primer creases\u00a0\u00a0\nif i leave it on set for some time but then when i\u00a0\nset it with eyeshadow it's like it's it's it stays\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it's not going anywhere but make sure that\u00a0\nyou're not like setting creases because that\u00a0\u00a0\nmakes no sense but this one was really easy to\u00a0\npick up and work with it reminds me a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nof the cream the powder from natasha nona it's\u00a0\nnot the same formula but like how it goes on\nand there's no fallout and there's no fallout\u00a0\nin the pan either okay i'm really liking this\u00a0\u00a0\none let me see if it works like natasha nona\u00a0\ncream to powder as well so you can build\u00a0\u00a0\na powder on top because there is a powder here and\u00a0\nget a bit of depth because for me this isn't deep\u00a0\u00a0\nenough to be like a finished look but let me blend\u00a0\nout the edges of it and like i don't know perfect\u00a0\u00a0\nthis are you excited about bridges in season two i\u00a0\nam very excited and i'm also does anyone know what\u00a0\u00a0\nseason two is gonna be about because i feel like\u00a0\nthey're probably i don't feel i feel like they're\u00a0\u00a0\nprobably not gonna make it all about is it anthony\u00a0\nthat's number two or maybe they will but there's a\u00a0\u00a0\nlot of things if you've read the books listen\u00a0\nthe series and the books they're they're not\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're not the same for example the queen she's\u00a0\nnever mentioned in the books i like that she's\u00a0\u00a0\nin the series but i'm just saying that there's\u00a0\na lot of things that's happening in the series\u00a0\u00a0\nthat never happens in the books but it makes sense\u00a0\nfor tv but i'm wondering if they're gonna do like\u00a0\u00a0\nfour or five of the siblings in this like\u00a0\nthe second season because a lot of the\u00a0\u00a0\nthings in the books are happening on the same\u00a0\ntimeline but it's divided into separate books\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm kind of wondering how they're gonna do\u00a0\nthat does anyone know how they're planning to\u00a0\u00a0\ndo that i'm very excited to see it i'm very\u00a0\nexcited to see it what was your favorite book\u00a0\u00a0\nokay let me let me finish this up and i'll\u00a0\ntell you my favorites okay i'm really liking\u00a0\u00a0\nthis i could honestly honestly i could just use a\u00a0\nlittle bit of like this one the light pink in the\u00a0\u00a0\nmiddle do some mascara be out the door because\u00a0\nthis is like easy fresh rose colored i like it\u00a0\u00a0\ni used some of the lighter pink here which is\u00a0\nalso that satiny like in jelly matte like it\u00a0\u00a0\nis it has to be a big delay it has a little bit\u00a0\nof a sheen but i think it goes on like a matte\u00a0\u00a0\nat least what i think i use the smaller brush\u00a0\nnow this is the defined crease brush and i'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to use this like the one that is the i\u00a0\nwould say it is like a dark mauve uh and i'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna see if we can build this on top and get a\u00a0\nlittle bit of depth because you know how i feel\u00a0\u00a0\ni need a little depth i need a\u00a0\nlittle depth otherwise i go crazy\non a scale of one to ten how\u00a0\noverly dramatic is that 13\n14. anyways my favorite book i read all of the\u00a0\nbooks and i highly recommend reading the books\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause like i said there are eight books one for\u00a0\neach sibling and they're not following the series\nvery loosely and the books are really\u00a0\nnice my favorite book is the one with\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't shoot me francesca oh it is the\u00a0\nlove story of love stories oh my god\u00a0\u00a0\ni loved it i love the francesca book and i love\u00a0\nthat she is like a little bit like me she's like\u00a0\u00a0\nshe loves her family but she's not the one that's\u00a0\nalways there she's keeping it a little bit on her\u00a0\u00a0\nown i love francesca this is this is working out\u00a0\nreally nice really beautiful and that book was\u00a0\u00a0\njust wonderful and i loved love the francesca\u00a0\nbook i also without spoiling and i think that\u00a0\u00a0\nthis will probably be in season two because they\u00a0\ndid spoil it at the end of season it's season one\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich is not what happens in book one at all\u00a0\nbut i really really loved the book where they\u00a0\u00a0\nare again without spoiling it because i don't want\u00a0\nto say like who gets who uh the book where they\u00a0\u00a0\nare spoiling um who uh whistled on whistle\u00a0\ndown is i really really liked that as well\u00a0\u00a0\num i really liked how they the the\u00a0\nbook was the book was beautiful i just\u00a0\u00a0\ni like that one a lot as well and i'm\u00a0\nthinking that what happened in that book is\u00a0\u00a0\nprobably gonna be in season two otherwise i would\u00a0\nbe surprised just based on like just based on like\njust based on how the books go and the timeline\u00a0\nand everything i'm wondering how they're gonna\u00a0\u00a0\ndo with eloise if you read the books you know that\u00a0\nlike she like runs away without like spoiling too\u00a0\u00a0\nmuch like are they going to do a separate timeline\u00a0\nhow i like i'm not sure how they're going to\u00a0\u00a0\ndo that i think i'm just going to do this rose\u00a0\ncolor all under my eyes where am i going to leave\u00a0\u00a0\na spot i think i'm going to leave let's leave a\u00a0\nspot i'm gonna leave a spot and then i'll come in\u00a0\u00a0\nand do this shimmery blue both on the top and the\u00a0\nbottom and maybe i'll use a little glitter glue\u00a0\u00a0\nso we can really get it to set because this is one\u00a0\nof the special shades and i will say my experience\u00a0\u00a0\nwith the special shades from pat mcgrath is\u00a0\nthat they travel everywhere everywhere your\u00a0\u00a0\ncheeks your cereal your dog your man everywhere\u00a0\nlike you will see it until the end of time it\u00a0\u00a0\nwill be on my casket okay so i brought out a\u00a0\nglitter glue lord only knows how old this one is\noh my is this gonna be i don't know how old\u00a0\nthis is oh look at me have my eye primer\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm just gonna take some off of my finger and\u00a0\ni'm using this primer and i'm just dotting it\u00a0\u00a0\non here in the middle i wish i knew what i\u00a0\nwas doing but i'm using a flat brush with no\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct just a primer and i'm dotting\u00a0\nit on here in the middle and i'm just\u00a0\u00a0\ndispersing it where i don't have any shadows and\u00a0\na little bit on the edges and up here and then i'm\u00a0\u00a0\ntaking the side that i didn't have the glue on and\u00a0\ni'm gonna go into that special shade that is that\u00a0\u00a0\nblue thing and i'm just gonna\u00a0\ntap that on oh that is pretty low\u00a0\u00a0\ni think with these special shades even though\u00a0\ni nev i never use glitter glue with my shadows\u00a0\u00a0\nit's not a thing i don't do that i will say that a\u00a0\nlot of times when people are saying that they use\u00a0\u00a0\nglitter glue to prevent creasing for me it never\u00a0\nprevents creasing at least not in my age bracket\u00a0\u00a0\nonce upon a time yes but this past couple of\u00a0\nyears not really but when there is shadows that\u00a0\u00a0\nhave a lot of sparkle in them and you notice\u00a0\nthat the sparkle doesn't seem to want to stay\u00a0\u00a0\nwhere you put it glitter glue really does help so\u00a0\ni'm just tapping on the edges a little bit here\u00a0\u00a0\nwith no additional product and i'm just\u00a0\nmaking sure that it's not a super harsh edge\u00a0\u00a0\nbut yeah i think it's gonna have to be\u00a0\nlike that but you see do you see that\u00a0\u00a0\nit is madness but yeah it's pretty it's\u00a0\nvery pretty but it is a little bit messy\u00a0\u00a0\nit's a little bit messy okay i'm putting some\u00a0\nglitter glue here as well in all my folds and\u00a0\u00a0\nwrinkles this could be a really bad idea\u00a0\nbut hey we're here to experiment aren't we\nno that looks cute i do have\u00a0\nglitter all over my cheek though\u00a0\u00a0\ni don't know if i'm getting rid\u00a0\nof it but it lives there now\u00a0\u00a0\nit's really really pretty i really really\u00a0\nlike it i'm gonna do the same on the other eye\u00a0\u00a0\nit's not as deep as i like but i still really\u00a0\nlike the contrast between the periwinkle\u00a0\u00a0\nand like the the almost like would i call this\u00a0\nlike raspberry pink red i'm using some prance\u00a0\u00a0\non my waterline but i thought that this would\u00a0\nmatch really well with the periwinkle right\ni think that's really pretty i am wearing one of\u00a0\nthe lip glosses from lh cosmetics this one is in\u00a0\u00a0\nmello mauve i will link all the things\u00a0\ndown below in case you're interested\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me finish this up and we can have a final\u00a0\nchat um i'm going on a vacation with my friend\u00a0\u00a0\nheather austin in a couple weeks and like i\u00a0\nhad this thought just pop into my head and\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm like i should i should read the bridgeton\u00a0\nagain and then remember i gave it to my mom\u00a0\u00a0\ni wonder if she read it i should ask her what she\u00a0\nthinks of it it's a really good series this is the\u00a0\u00a0\nfinished look everything is done oh maybe i want\u00a0\nto do an inner corner highlight should i just do\u00a0\u00a0\ni think i'm just going to do the highlighter\u00a0\nbecause that one had like a really metallic\u00a0\u00a0\nglow to it i kind of wanted to use this one but\u00a0\nnow i have red on it i really enjoy the brushes\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom makeup geek especially this one the one that\u00a0\nis the defined crease brush it's such a small like\u00a0\u00a0\nnice blending brush for like detail work i'll\u00a0\njust use a little bit of this i like doing an\u00a0\u00a0\ninner corner highlight when i do halo eyes too\u00a0\nbecause i feel like it could be really pretty\u00a0\u00a0\ni do prefer having matte inner corner highlights\u00a0\nlately though but that is pretty just a little\u00a0\u00a0\njust a little something like i see a hair in front\u00a0\nof my eyes i really hope you like the video and i\u00a0\u00a0\nhope you like the look this isn't me like dogging\u00a0\non the brand being like this sucks but you are\u00a0\u00a0\npaying a lot of money for pat mcgrath and this\u00a0\nis the first time that i am ordering directly\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom her website and i will say i'm not like\u00a0\nsuper convinced that i will be buying directly\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom the website again because it's like i might\u00a0\nas well just buy from somewhere else because i\u00a0\u00a0\nalso had a problem like if you're on twitter you\u00a0\nknow i had a problem with the shipping because\u00a0\u00a0\ni entered my u.s address because this was\u00a0\nreleased on the 26th and i was moving on the 29th\u00a0\u00a0\nso i entered a u.s address because i knew\u00a0\nthat i was going to be in the us when this one\u00a0\u00a0\nwas like being delivered or at least around the\u00a0\naround around there like around around those dates\u00a0\u00a0\nso i entered the u.s address and i checked out and\u00a0\nit said u.s and then when i got the confirmation\u00a0\u00a0\nemail they had changed it to sweden because the\u00a0\nwebsite could see that i was in sweden it's like\u00a0\u00a0\nbut now you made up an address so the confirmation\u00a0\nmail that i got was the u.s address but they just\u00a0\u00a0\nchanged us to sweden like that makes no sense\u00a0\nlike if you are like i can tell you're in sweden\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can't add it like a us address which was not\u00a0\nthe case by the way because i i did another order\u00a0\u00a0\nand then it was fine so this was just a one time\u00a0\nit was stupid but like you can't just change the\u00a0\u00a0\ncountry because now you just made up an address\u00a0\nbut fortunately the customer service got back to\u00a0\u00a0\nme quicker than they said because they were like\u00a0\noh we'll get back to you in 72 hours i'm like\u00a0\u00a0\nnaive me was like oh but you\u00a0\nalready shipped items by then\u00a0\u00a0\npoor instant summer child little did i know that\u00a0\nthey were not going to ship them for two weeks\u00a0\u00a0\nbut actually customer service got back to me a\u00a0\nlot quicker than that they canceled that order\u00a0\u00a0\nso i was able but i mean like i said i was able\u00a0\nto do another order to my u.s address and at that\u00a0\u00a0\npoint it didn't change it to the us so like i'm\u00a0\njust saying and this is just what i'm saying if\u00a0\u00a0\nit is a luxury brand there needs to be a luxury\u00a0\nexperience and if it is a pre-order like there\u00a0\u00a0\nneeds to be this is a pre-order because two weeks\u00a0\nof handling that is that isn't that is a pre-order\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's a pre-order okay if you're interested\u00a0\nin these things i will leave them down below\u00a0\u00a0\ni will say quality wise everything is beautiful i\u00a0\nprefer something that is a little bit deeper for\u00a0\u00a0\nthe eyes but it's not that hard for me to reach\u00a0\nfor matte black or something i still like the\u00a0\u00a0\nquality of these and i will say i especially like\u00a0\ni especially like these two that have the like the\u00a0\u00a0\nbee imprint the ones that are like the satiny\u00a0\nthey're not a satin because they don't have a\u00a0\u00a0\nsheen to them but they're like a matte with a\u00a0\nsheen they're like a baked chili mat that has\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit of a sheen to them but i don't think\u00a0\nthey're [ __ ] on the eyes the formula is stunning\u00a0\u00a0\nso easy to work with so easy to blend no fall out\u00a0\neither in the pan or on the cheeks really really\u00a0\u00a0\npretty so yeah all in all i mean i'm excited about\u00a0\nit but on the other hand like i was more excited\u00a0\u00a0\nbuying it than i was receiving it and i don't\u00a0\nthink that that is how makeup should be you should\u00a0\u00a0\nbe the most excited receiving it and using it then\u00a0\nyou are purchasing it because makeup isn't about\u00a0\u00a0\nbuying makeup it's about using makeup wearing\u00a0\nmakeup or at least owning makeup the buying\u00a0\u00a0\nexperience should be an added bonus it shouldn't\u00a0\nbe like the climax anyways i hope you enjoyed\u00a0\u00a0\nthe video please don't forget to subscribe and\u00a0\ni'll see you again tomorrow for a new video bye\nyou",

                    "@Manners Bananers A lot of people can afford Pat McGrath and Natasha Denona but think it is a little crazy to spend that kind of money for eyeshadow. Especially Natasha Denona. Beautiful color stories. Quality just average. To point it out isn\u2019t jealousy or resentment. I think all luxury is BS. There is a point where the price far exceeds the quality. The more social media pushes these things the more people who go into hock to attain it the more other companies will see how far consumers will go and sell for higher prices.",
                    "They&#39;re luxury brands, just like Dior or Chanel. It&#39;s not &quot;normalized&quot;, everyone knows that is a ridiculous price tag. It&#39;s like spending 1000$ on a handbag or a pair of shoes, or 100,000$ on a car. You don&#39;t do that because it&#39;s a normal price, you do that for yourself because it makes you feel very fancy and like you accomplished to be able to afford that. No one says you have to pay that price for an eyeshadow palette, there are plenty of fantastic brands with regular prices for you to choose from.",

I purchased the Bridgerton palette on the original launch day and like everyone else mine didn\u2019t come until the second week of January. It was an issue with the supplier as to why the shipping was late. I ordered 2 lipsticks and they shipped the day after I ordered them and I got them a few days later. I ordered the Bridgerton blush palette and the highlighter on the restock on Friday the 21st and it shipped on Monday. I received it yesterday. When I was ordering during the restock I was changing my card number when I placed my order and accidentally hit place order so I didn\u2019t have a chance to enter the code I wanted. I emailed customer service and was refunded the amount for the code. Of course when you order from Sephora you get points and free gifts and samples with orders but a lot of times your items can come broken. Shipping from there usually takes longer considering how fast I got my most recent orders from the Pat site. Not to mention no discount codes at this time either. To each their own though.",
                    "Gotta say, i ordered directly from danessa myricks and they shipped from US, but it got to me the VERY NEXT DAY. My mind was blown, first time ever for the canadian shipping price to be actually worth it. I was so confused when the delivery guy showed up, but incredibly happy and absolutely love everything i got ( one out of 10 is so so but still good)"

All the reviews I could find were from Pat McGrath fangirls so I didn&#39;t feel comfortable trusting them. What it finally came down to was it being $200+ for the whole collection and I didn&#39;t think I was going to enjoy it $200+ worth when half of what drew me in was the packaging, and I didn&#39;t like the packaging as much in person. I finally decided to return it all untried to save myself an expensive disappointment. I hope people who got it enjoy it but I decided it wasn&#39;t for me.",

My belief is that the Whistledown storyline will be included in season two as well as Anthony&#39;s storyline. I honestly kinda hope they leave out Eloise&#39;s storyline all over, because I feel like she changes drastically from the previous books in that one and it doesn&#39;t make sense with the Eloise we have gotten to know in the TV series. Eloise&#39;s arc also doesn&#39;t really make that much sense if the whole Wistledown reveal happens before it does in the books, but who knows really? Book 4, 5 and 6 happen almost simultaneously so they have a lot to play around with storywise.",

is called whistler\u00a0\u00a0\nsnow launch i just got this in the mail yesterday\u00a0\nevening we are gonna do two looks some swatches\u00a0\u00a0\nand i'm gonna let you know my thoughts about\u00a0\nthis and if you haven't been before if this is\u00a0\u00a0\nthe first video here hello my name is angie i'm\u00a0\nsuch a lover of beauty makeup i love everything\u00a0\u00a0\nbeauty makeup related especially love things are\u00a0\na little bit more colorful and let me tell you\nthis is very much off my eyes so if you want to\u00a0\nsee someone make videos on a timeline if you want\u00a0\u00a0\nto see some more coloring timeline definitely do\u00a0\nsubscribe because i upload quite a lot of videos\nthis palette came so pretty packaged in this like\u00a0\nbeautiful wrapping paper and then it had this\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful box it says whistler snow lodge and i\u00a0\nalso got this one you know the hang on the door it\u00a0\u00a0\nsays do not disturb for fox sake i'm sleeping fox\u00a0\nokay don't demonetize me and then there is like\u00a0\u00a0\nthis little card here that says nomad lodge and\u00a0\nthere always is a postcard from the destination\u00a0\u00a0\nnomad cosmetics is a destination themed makeup\u00a0\nbrand and this is from whistler whistler canada\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm super excited it came with this little uh\u00a0\ntissue paper inside the palette beautiful palette\u00a0\u00a0\nthat has a mirror on the inside and the the colors\u00a0\nare just stunning this is a 15 pound palette and\u00a0\u00a0\nit has shimmers and mattes and there's also from\u00a0\nwhat i can see in the palette two duochromes one\u00a0\u00a0\nis a white to pink and the other one seems to be\u00a0\na light blue to a lavender as i'm filming this i\u00a0\u00a0\nhaven't swatched it but you're seeing the swatches\u00a0\nnow this looks beautiful it goes from light to\u00a0\u00a0\nmedium to dark which is something that i really\u00a0\nlove with eyeshadows as i said i did get sent this\u00a0\u00a0\nas pr which is very exciting i'm starting to get\u00a0\nsome pr my new home here in austin i'm so excited\u00a0\u00a0\nand we are gonna do two looks i love when i get\u00a0\nnew palettes in the mail i love doing it first\u00a0\u00a0\nand the second impression to use as many shades\u00a0\nas possible and then i'll come back a month later\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen i've been able to try it a bit more either\u00a0\non camera or off camera and i'll let you know my\u00a0\u00a0\nfinal thoughts so even though this is a first and\u00a0\nsecond impression this is not my final thoughts\u00a0\u00a0\non the palette but i do really like nomad as a\u00a0\nbrand nomad did offer me an affiliate called my\u00a0\u00a0\naffiliate code is ajeshka and if you use that you\u00a0\nwill say 10 on your purchase and i don't accept\u00a0\u00a0\naffiliate codes from brands that i don't like and\u00a0\nthat i don't like enjoy the things i will link to\u00a0\u00a0\nthings that i have on my face down below in case\u00a0\nyou're interested but let's jump in to number one\u00a0\u00a0\nwait wait wait i forgot to tell you details this\u00a0\nis launching on tuesday january 25th this is 39.15\u00a0\u00a0\neyeshadow palette is not limited edition so\u00a0\nyeah let's jump into look number one i guess\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so i put a little eye primer on i'm gonna\u00a0\nuse you can see in here i'm gonna use all the\u00a0\u00a0\nblue shades like there are four blue shades and\u00a0\ni am gonna use all of them in this look i think\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm gonna start with snow bunny which is the light\u00a0\nblue uh and i am gonna put that in the crease\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm just gonna do like i wanna see if these\u00a0\nare good quality blues i love blue eyeshadow\u00a0\u00a0\nblue eyeshadow is something that i really love\u00a0\ni've been really into greens lately though but\u00a0\u00a0\ni really love blue eyeshadows i just think that a\u00a0\nlot of people are scared of blue eyeshadow for a\u00a0\u00a0\nreason it's so pretty it's so flattering it looks\u00a0\nso beautiful with all eye colors according to me\u00a0\u00a0\nlike if you have brown eyes with blue\u00a0\neyeshadow oh my god it's so pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nand i just want to see if this is good\u00a0\nblues and i'll do a second look as well\u00a0\u00a0\nand i'll probably use the reds the greens and the\u00a0\nyellows in that one just to try as many shades as\u00a0\u00a0\npossible but now i just want to see if these are\u00a0\ngood blues and so far that is looking very pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nnow i'm taking the shade it's called snowmad pun\u00a0\nintended on a smaller brush and i am going to\u00a0\u00a0\ndeepen up the crease with\u00a0\nthat wow that is stunning\u00a0\u00a0\nokay this is a really nice matte i can\u00a0\nalready tell because it builds on that pastel\noh yes i love this color i hope i'm\u00a0\nable to make it as dark as i want it\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i just love a true blue look so pretty i'm\u00a0\njust trying to like build a bit now to have\u00a0\u00a0\nit the shape and the color that\u00a0\ni want and then i will blend it\u00a0\u00a0\ni will blend it a bit afterwards probably\u00a0\nblend on the edge with the lighter blue as well\u00a0\u00a0\nhmm maybe it's not perfectly building\u00a0\nto the depth that i want it to be\nbut i still like it maybe i prefer\u00a0\nsomething that's slightly slightly\u00a0\u00a0\nslightly more buildable than this but i still love\u00a0\nthe tone of the shadow i prefer something that's\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit more buildable because it doesn't\u00a0\nshow up as dark on the eyes as it does in the\u00a0\u00a0\npan i'm also gonna use these blues under my\u00a0\neyes as well to have like the blue all over\u00a0\u00a0\nmakes me so happy so i was able to do something\u00a0\nvery dramatic and very colorful but i will\u00a0\u00a0\nsay like look at the shade here it's not that\u00a0\ndarkness i'm not able to create that darkness so\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm missing a little bit of depth but i still\u00a0\nthink that this is really really pretty i am\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna use this one that's called black comb\u00a0\nand this one here that's called ski bum\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm gonna use those on my lid and am i gonna\u00a0\nuse that in my inner corners as well no i'll\u00a0\u00a0\nprobably use something else i am spraying the\u00a0\nshadows because i don't like fallout am i in\u00a0\u00a0\nfocus i think i am and i think that spraying your\u00a0\nshimmers prevents fallout that is an incredible\u00a0\u00a0\nklein blue metallic with a lot of sparkle\u00a0\nand shine no glitter but like just very\u00a0\u00a0\nsparkly and beautiful wow what a pretty\u00a0\nshade i'm putting that on half the lid\nwhat do you are you seeing that wow okay i\u00a0\nam smitten smitten by that shade i'm not too\u00a0\u00a0\nthorough because like i don't want to create harsh\u00a0\nlines when i'm doing a lot of my looks i'm just\u00a0\u00a0\ntapping a little bit and i'll probably\u00a0\nuse the same brushes i use for the other\u00a0\u00a0\none and i'll just tap a little bit in my\u00a0\nouter corner just to i don't know blendish\nhi husband okay now i'm taking the other\u00a0\none that's a little lighter and i'm just\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna put that on the inner part oh that's really\u00a0\npretty this reminds me of a shade i've had before\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i don't remember oh it reminds me of one of\u00a0\nthe cleona shadows that is not a what is that one\u00a0\u00a0\ncalled i think it's called cokes it reminds me of\u00a0\nthat one i know i've mentioned that as a favorite\u00a0\u00a0\ncleona shadow it's not a stained glass shadow so\u00a0\nit's more affordable it's also this like light\u00a0\u00a0\nblue with a purple duochrome i think it's called\u00a0\ncokes that is stunning okay i really love that\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm gonna put something in my unicorns i'm\u00a0\nprobably gonna do math in the corner because\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm all about that life and i'm just gonna finish\u00a0\nthis up and we'll just i don't know see what it\u00a0\u00a0\nlooks like apparently husband wants something what\u00a0\ndo you want my computer i stole the computer the\u00a0\u00a0\nonly computer for the internet okay so this is\u00a0\nthe finished look and the dog decided to do a big\u00a0\u00a0\nsigh but this is the finished look with some half\u00a0\nlashes from vive i'm also using the prance liner\u00a0\u00a0\nthis i think i mentioned this in either 2017 or\u00a0\n2018's yearly favorites it is still my favorite\u00a0\u00a0\neyeliner i even have a backup and i did use a\u00a0\nlittle bit of the natasha denona scene on the\u00a0\u00a0\nthe like almost white in my inner corners i\u00a0\nreally like it i like this look a lot and i\u00a0\u00a0\nthink it looks really pretty let me zoom out and\u00a0\nwe can see the full thing and then we have to get\u00a0\u00a0\nready for look number two okay so this is the\u00a0\nfinished look this is me zooming out a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit i'm a little bit curious about the lighting i\u00a0\ndon't know if it feels dark or if this feels good\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm not 100 sure i don't know what i'm doing\u00a0\nbut this is the look um i enjoy it i'm going\u00a0\u00a0\nto wear it for the rest of the day and you're\u00a0\ngoing to see look number two right now okay\u00a0\u00a0\nso a lot of things have changed since i last\u00a0\nfilmed i have changed my setting i have changed\u00a0\u00a0\num i've changed my settings i've changed my lights\u00a0\ni've changed my background and i've changed my\u00a0\u00a0\nsound i was thinking of re-filming the first\u00a0\nlook but you know what this channel is a work in\u00a0\u00a0\nprogress and i know you're gonna be you're gonna\u00a0\nbe fine with it you're gonna have to let me know\u00a0\u00a0\nif you think that this one is better or if you\u00a0\nthink the other one is better i prefer this one\u00a0\u00a0\ni prefer this one i think that this looks more\u00a0\nlike my skin tone maybe it is washing it out just\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit but it could be that i'm pretty close\u00a0\nto the lights i am gonna do something okay between\u00a0\u00a0\nme filming this between me filming the first look\u00a0\nat me filming the second look i swatched these and\u00a0\u00a0\nthis green one that is called whistler which\u00a0\nis the destination this is like green metallic\u00a0\u00a0\nit is so pretty we have we have to do something\u00a0\nwith it i'm actually going to start with the dark\u00a0\u00a0\ngreen this time to see how deep it can be last\u00a0\ntime i totally missed that there was actually\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a matte black in here i could have totally\u00a0\ndeepened up the look with that one how many of you\u00a0\u00a0\nwere screaming at the screen that i didn't use the\u00a0\nmatte black i forgot but now i'm gonna start with\u00a0\u00a0\nthe dark green it is called bucking great and i am\u00a0\njust gonna do a little bit of a blob out here when\u00a0\u00a0\ni want the shadow to look like it does in the pan\u00a0\ni tend to start with the deepest and blend it out\u00a0\u00a0\nwith the lightest it's a really nice way of\u00a0\nmaking the most of your shadows to make them as\u00a0\u00a0\nopaque and as dark as they can be so i'm putting\u00a0\na little blob out here like this this little shape\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm gonna do the same on the other side i did get\u00a0\na little fallout and see if i can get rid of that\u00a0\u00a0\nand oh i don't have any blush or highlighter\u00a0\non that's pretty unusual that's pretty unusual\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe i'll use one of the shadows like in\u00a0\nthis palette as a highlighter that one that's\u00a0\u00a0\ncalled powder specialist because it is that like\u00a0\nduochrome pink maybe i'll try how did i forget\u00a0\u00a0\nblush and highlight i don't know i don't know\u00a0\nwhat's wrong now that i have the shadows on\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm just gonna gently i'm actually gonna let me\u00a0\nget one of these you know one of these i'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nclean off my brush a little bit so that we have as\u00a0\nlittle product as possible on it and then i'm just\u00a0\u00a0\ndotting a little bit on the edge just so we\u00a0\ncan like get this to break up a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nbefore we go in with a lighter color just to help\u00a0\na little bit i'm taking the color apres ski which\u00a0\u00a0\nis that like almost minty minty green it's like\u00a0\na pistachio ice cream almost but it's like a mint\u00a0\u00a0\nlighter color it's also matte and i'm just tapping\u00a0\nyou can see tap tap tap and then i'm just small\u00a0\u00a0\ncircular motions on the edge i'm not taking it in\u00a0\nhere because i'm gonna have another color there\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i'm not making any big swooping motions and\u00a0\ni'm not taking it over the dark color here and i'm\u00a0\u00a0\nalso gonna go over and blend this in a bit but now\u00a0\ni'm just softening up the edge making an effort to\u00a0\u00a0\nblend it outwards and to make the edge here soft\u00a0\nand then i will blend these two colors together\u00a0\u00a0\ni don't know if you can hear\u00a0\nmy dog snoring but he is loud\nhe is loud this is where we are right now\u00a0\nand i think it's really really pretty it's\u00a0\u00a0\nonly two shadows and i'm gonna use this one\u00a0\nfor fox sake which is this like bricky red\u00a0\u00a0\nthere is so much sound in the background and i\u00a0\ndon't know if the like the microphone is picking\u00a0\u00a0\nthat up or not i don't think it is because like\u00a0\ni've never filmed with the microphone before so if\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm like talking about the sound and stuff like\u00a0\ndon't be don't be too annoyed with me i'm just\u00a0\u00a0\nnot used to it like with time i'm sure that i\u00a0\nwill learn just as i did with my old room and\u00a0\u00a0\nwith my old settings what gets picked up by the\u00a0\ncamera versus not but right now i have no idea\u00a0\u00a0\nthere are like planes going by there's like yard\u00a0\nwork neighbors talking outside like i don't know\u00a0\u00a0\nhow much of that you're hearing so it's going to\u00a0\nbe interesting for me as well to watch it back\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm doing i'm really liking this okay i'm just\u00a0\nputting it on this is the new brush set by game\u00a0\u00a0\nbeauty by the way it's actually really really nice\u00a0\nand now i'm just gonna gently brush this upwards\nand diffuse this a little bit\ni'm liking that i just want to do i just want to\u00a0\ndo something that's a little bit different you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow sometimes even though you're like you're\u00a0\nlike me and i'm like oh my god i love colorful\u00a0\u00a0\neyeshadows and i love trying new things and blah\u00a0\nblah blah you end up doing the same things either\u00a0\u00a0\nway like yeah i love colorful eyeshadows but i\u00a0\nend up doing the same shapes and the same things\u00a0\u00a0\nand blah blah blah blah and there's nothing\u00a0\nwrong with that but i also want to try new things\u00a0\u00a0\nso i decided that i am gonna do something a\u00a0\nlittle bit different and i'm kind of enjoying that\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's actually looking really pretty let me\u00a0\nput a little more color on i'm going to perfect\u00a0\u00a0\nthis a little bit and then i'm going to\u00a0\ncut with i'm actually going to use this one\nthe concealer of doom this is the jaclyn cosmetics\u00a0\nconcealer this concealer is straight up cement so\u00a0\u00a0\ni think it's going to be great for cut creases so\u00a0\ni mean is this me shading it a little bit yeah i\u00a0\u00a0\nguess but let me blend this one and i can show\u00a0\nyou what i mean with just cutting this part here\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so i'm taking the concealer and i'm\u00a0\nusing a very small flat brush and i am taking\u00a0\u00a0\nthe product from the doe\u00a0\nfoot and i am going to cut it\njust along the inner part\u00a0\u00a0\nso it's something like that and i'm\u00a0\njust taking the concealer off on my hand\nand i'm gonna use some of the berry cool which\u00a0\nis that like yellowy gold and i'm putting that\non the part closest to the inner corner\nand up in a diagonal towards where the line\u00a0\nends and i'm taking the shade it's called\u00a0\u00a0\nwhistler which is that like almost like\u00a0\nsagey green metallic and i'm putting that\u00a0\u00a0\nunderneath i'm taking a little bit of that dark\u00a0\ngreen again and i'm just gonna take that in here\u00a0\u00a0\nsame like diagonal that i like\u00a0\nusing when i do my eye looks\u00a0\u00a0\nand i'm just dotting on the\u00a0\nedge to get it to go in a bit\u00a0\u00a0\nbut yeah this is this is how it's gonna look i\u00a0\nam gonna put the green the dark green under my\u00a0\u00a0\neyes as well and i'll come back and we can finish\u00a0\nthe look up i gotta say this is really pretty i\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it it's a little bit different i'm a big fan\u00a0\nlet's try this one that's called powder specialist\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah you can see here that has a little bit\u00a0\nof a pink shift to it i'm gonna try that i'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna spray it and i'm gonna try it as an inner\u00a0\ncorner highlight oh it's almost a little bit like\u00a0\u00a0\npurple pink oh that's that's not what i\u00a0\nwas expecting do i even like this here\u00a0\u00a0\nwell i have committed i have committed and\u00a0\nwe are doing it i did bring out a highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\nbrush as well so that we can use this shade as a\u00a0\nlittle bit of a highlighter it's not super like\u00a0\u00a0\npigmented or creamy so it might be a really\u00a0\nnice subtle highlighter i mean it's still a\u00a0\u00a0\npurply pink shift but it's also not like a\u00a0\nstripe stripe well that works pretty okay\u00a0\u00a0\nnot too shabby actually okay so this is the\u00a0\nfinished look this is what it looks like when\u00a0\u00a0\ni have everything on i did use a little bit of\u00a0\nthe glitter liner from opv this one is in o2\u00a0\u00a0\nsparkler just to like intensify the gold line\u00a0\ni really do like this look and i will say\u00a0\u00a0\ni really do like this palette i think that this\u00a0\npalette is really nice it's not as buildable as i\u00a0\u00a0\nwould prefer but it is buildable like you are able\u00a0\nto build a darker color on top of a lighter color\u00a0\u00a0\nbut if you want it to be like this dark or this\u00a0\nthis dark you're probably gonna have to start\u00a0\u00a0\nwith the darkest color like i did today but i mean\u00a0\nyou can see this result it's really really pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nand i enjoyed it the shimmers are incredibly\u00a0\npretty like so so pretty i can't even like\u00a0\u00a0\nthis green is just everything in the blue\u00a0\nlike this color here i mean you saw the swatch\u00a0\u00a0\nstunning so so pretty did i mention that i have\u00a0\na code with nomad cosmetics i don't know if i\u00a0\u00a0\nmentioned that i have a code i do have a\u00a0\ncode with no my cosmetics i'm the worst\u00a0\u00a0\nat remembering stuff like this but i will leave\u00a0\nthe code down below in case you want to save 10\u00a0\u00a0\nthe code is affiliated i always mark what's\u00a0\naffiliate down below so that you don't get\u00a0\u00a0\nconfused but thank you so much for watching\u00a0\ndo let me know your thoughts down below\u00a0\u00a0\nall the info is going to be in the description\u00a0\nbox i will see you again in my next video bye\nyou",

let's\u00a0\u00a0\ngo ahead and talk about the eyeshadow palette i\u00a0\nam in love in love with these shades right here\u00a0\u00a0\ni think that they are so so so beautiful and it\u00a0\ndoes not emphasize the texture on my eyelid which\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's like a number one pet peeve of mine\u00a0\nwhenever eyeshadow palettes look super amazing\u00a0\u00a0\nand they have like the most beautiful shades but\u00a0\nonce you put it on the eyelid and they emphasize\u00a0\u00a0\nany of my lines they're like not for me at all\u00a0\nand these right here they are not doing that at\u00a0\u00a0\nall they're just gliding on to the eyelid they\u00a0\njust went on super nice super buttery really\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful they blended to each other effortlessly\u00a0\ni barely had to blend which is amazing the matte\u00a0\u00a0\nthey just felt super soft to the touch and i'm\u00a0\ntrying to think of an eyeshadow in my collection\u00a0\u00a0\nthat i felt like that and i i just can't i just\u00a0\ncan't think of anything that feels that soft\u00a0\u00a0\nno fallout whatsoever when i was applying it to\u00a0\nthe eyes and i already had my foundation done so\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's definitely a plus for me for sure there was\u00a0\na little bit of fallout with these two right here\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i was able to clean it out super easy so yeah\u00a0\nreally impressed with this palette like i cannot\u00a0\u00a0\nwait to make more looks i actually want to use the\u00a0\nblack all over and maybe this gunmetal on top of\u00a0\u00a0\nit with a little bit of this shade i don't know i\u00a0\nhave so many looks already on mine or really nice\u00a0\u00a0\npalette for sure really nice quality but yeah\u00a0\nthat's it for this video please don't forget\u00a0\u00a0\nto like that definitely helps up my channel a lot\u00a0\nand of course subscribe to my channel if you have\u00a0\u00a0\nnot already thank you so much for your love your\u00a0\ntime and support and i will see you next time bye",

        "transcript_text": "Ahoy, ahoy my name is lenka Oshry, welcome to Skincare\u00a0\nwith Lenka, before we start i would love if you\u00a0\u00a0\nsubscribe to my channel i will appreciate it a\u00a0\nlot, in today's video i will review two Lelive\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts specifically vitamin c serum and their\u00a0\ntinted spf moisturizer, i have already reviewed\u00a0\u00a0\nthese items in my previous lelive review video\u00a0\nbut this time i have purchased the product and i\u00a0\u00a0\nhave been using them for a while so i can give you\u00a0\nbetter review based on personal experience as well\u00a0\u00a0\nLelive is vegan, cruelty free, sulfate free,\u00a0\nparaben free, dye free and they have conscious\u00a0\u00a0\npackaging but they're not all fragrance free some\u00a0\nof their products contain natural fragrances aka\u00a0\u00a0\nessential oils, all right so let's start with the\u00a0\nvitamin c serum and it's it's called: all glowed up\u00a0\u00a0\nvitamin c turmeric plus hyaluronic acid brightening\u00a0\nserum, i've been using this serum for a few\u00a0\u00a0\nweeks i love it, i feel that it really improved\u00a0\nmy skin, the combination of the ingredients are\u00a0\u00a0\nstunning, the packaging is studying, they don't\u00a0\nuse glass they use aluminium so you can \nrecycle those as well, the only plastic bit is the\u00a0\npart of the dropper, this serum is fragrance\u00a0\u00a0\nfree so it doesn't have any natural or synthetic\u00a0\nfragrance in it, the texture is really nice\u00a0\u00a0\ni almost finished it up and then i realized\u00a0\ni haven't reviewed it, you can see this nice yellow\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor and it is a little bit jelly but not too\u00a0\nmuch, absorbs really quickly, it's just really\u00a0\u00a0\ngood serum so let's talk about the ingredients\u00a0\nin this serum, first one a very good one of\u00a0\u00a0\ncourse it's niacinamide vitamin b3 and vitamin\u00a0\nb3 is a antioxidant it reduces the oilness on the\u00a0\u00a0\nskin, brightens the skin, reduce the redness, it is\u00a0\noverall ingredient for all skin types no matter if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou have rosacea, if you have dry skin, if you have\u00a0\noily skin, if you have whatever skin niacinamide\u00a0\u00a0\nis always good so this ingredient provides\u00a0\nthe brightness and in this serum of course\u00a0\u00a0\nthe next brightening ingredient in this serum is\u00a0\nlicorice root and licorice root is a antioxidant\u00a0\u00a0\nit also reduces the redness, it is\u00a0\nanti-inflammatory and fights hyperpigmentation\u00a0\u00a0\nnext ingredient in this serum is bakuchiol and\u00a0\nbakuchiol is a antioxidant, it is anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0\nand antibacterial, it can improve hyperpigmentation,\u00a0\nfine lines , wrinkle, skin texture and skin tone\u00a0\u00a0\nit also contains salix alba or willow bark and\u00a0\nwillow bark is anti-inflammatory and antibacterial\u00a0\u00a0\nof course it contains hyaluronic acid and hyaluronic\nacid is humectant so it hydrates the skin by\u00a0\u00a0\ncapturing the water and push it into deeper\u00a0\nlayers of our skin and what about the vitamin\u00a0\u00a0\nc and turmeric in this serum, well i don't think\u00a0\nthey do much because vitamin c or ascorbic acid\u00a0\u00a0\nis super finicky, very hard to formulate\u00a0\nit degrades easily, it oxidizes easily\u00a0\u00a0\nand for vitamin c to be stable it needs to be\u00a0\nformulated with vitamin e and with ferulic acid\u00a0\u00a0\nso the serum contains vitamin e but is missing\u00a0\nferulic acid and also it needs to be at least\u00a0\u00a0\n10% of ascorbic acid for it to have any\u00a0\neffect on our skin and in this serum we don't know\u00a0\u00a0\nhow much vitamin c the percentage because they\u00a0\ndidn't state it, the last ingredient i will\u00a0\u00a0\nmention in this serum is turmeric and turmeric\u00a0\nis likewise very difficult ingredient because\u00a0\u00a0\nof its ph and its water solubility, it has very\u00a0\nvery hard time to penetrate the skin membrane\u00a0\u00a0\n...the cell membrane and do what\u00a0\nit's supposed to do so again it\u00a0\u00a0\nmight do something and probably doesn't do\u00a0\nanything in the serum but as i said before\u00a0\u00a0\nthis serum is amazing it's still going to give you\u00a0\nglow up as i said i think it did improve my skin\u00a0\u00a0\ni really like it and i will\u00a0\ndefinitely purchase it again\nand the next favorite product from lelive\u00a0\nis their tinted spf moisturizer and this\u00a0\u00a0\nis: all the shade marula tinted\u00a0\nspf 30 broad spectrum moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0\nthis moisturizer it is sunscreen basically\u00a0\nbut in a form of moisturizer, so sunscreens\u00a0\u00a0\nand moisturizer with spf they're basically\u00a0\nthe same thing but if this labeled  moisturizer\u00a0\u00a0\nis probably more hydrating, more moisturizing,\u00a0\nmore nourishing for the skin, i have been using\u00a0\u00a0\nthis sunscreen for a while and i actually\u00a0\nwearing it now instead of makeup foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nmy skin is clear so i don't\u00a0\nhave need to put full coverage foundation\u00a0\u00a0\ni only want something to give me nice\u00a0\nhealthy glow and this indeed gives you\u00a0\u00a0\njuicy skin, hydrated skin, the the shade is\u00a0\namazing even though it's much darker than my skin\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen you apply it sort of disappear and just give\u00a0\nyou this fantastic glow and it is suitable for all\u00a0\u00a0\nskin tones, the sunscreen ingredient in this \nsunscreen or moisturizer is zinc oxide and iron\u00a0\u00a0\noxides, iron oxide it gives the tint, the\u00a0\ncolor of the the moisturizer and also protects\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom a visible blue light and blue visible\u00a0\nlight is responsible for a hyperpigmentation\u00a0\u00a0\nif you are darker skin tone and\u00a0you are\nbattling  with hyperpigmentation this\u00a0\u00a0\nspf might be just perfect for you and it\u00a0\nis also mineral sunscreen so it's much gentler\u00a0\u00a0\nthan chemical sunscreen but make no mistake, chemical sunscreen and mineral sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0\nthey are equal good so use whatever is best for your\u00a0\nskin, whatever feels good on the skin then wear\u00a0\nthat sunscreen, this

this\u00a0\u00a0\nunderneath my eye area i'm going to use my fingers\u00a0\nfor this i just love the glow that this product\u00a0\u00a0\ngives and i have normal to dry skin in case you're\u00a0\nwondering now i'm going to go in with the rare\u00a0\u00a0\nbeauty foundation and mine is in the shade\u00a0\n170w so a little bit of this goes a long way\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm just going to start with this and we'll see\u00a0\nand i'm gonna use my rare beauty foundation brush\u00a0\u00a0\nit's kind of like a a rare a full face of\u00a0\nrare beauty almost i don't have the mascara\u00a0\u00a0\ni don't have the spray i don't have any\u00a0\nlip products but mostly complexion products\nnow i'm gonna go in with my beauty\u00a0\nblender and push everything in\u00a0\u00a0\nthis foundation is really really beautiful\u00a0\nlook at the beautiful coverage it provides\u00a0\u00a0\nnow let's move on to the rare beauty\u00a0\nconcealer again this is in the shade\u00a0\u00a0\n170w so i'm going to add this in the inner corner\u00a0\nouter on the eyelids and i'm gonna go in with my\u00a0\u00a0\nrare beauty concealer brush i like to start\u00a0\nwith the brush and then move on to a sponge\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm gonna set my under eye area with\u00a0\nthe pat mcgrath under eye sublime fetish\u00a0\u00a0\ntranslucent powder so let's move on to the\u00a0\nhighlighter i'm going to use the lila b\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlighter in the shade enchanting i'm just\u00a0\ngonna use my finger and add a little bit of glow\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is such a nice natural highlighter so\u00a0\nlet's move on to the actual bronzer right now\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is the rare beauty by selena gomez it's\u00a0\ncalled the warm wishes effortless bronzer stick\u00a0\u00a0\nthis retails for 30 on the sephora canada\u00a0\nwebsite this comes into five shades i got\u00a0\u00a0\nmine in the first shade which is called power\u00a0\nboost this is a stick formula it has a natural\u00a0\u00a0\nfinish light coverage long wearing it's\u00a0\nvegan it's a breakthrough bronzing stick\u00a0\u00a0\nfor a quick and visible sunkist glow\u00a0\nwith a smooth seamless second skin finish\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is what the packaging looks like\u00a0\nit's the regular rare beauty packaging\u00a0\u00a0\nin here it says you are rare that's so cute\u00a0\nand this is the bronzing stick it is very slick\u00a0\u00a0\nlooking it's the off-white pinkish component\u00a0\nwith the light gold bottom and top it has the\u00a0\u00a0\nrare beauty logo right here and the shade power\u00a0\nboost on the bottom it's made in italy it's a\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful product beautiful component and this is\u00a0\nwhat it looks like now let me swatch this compared\u00a0\u00a0\nto others so i have here a couple of other sticks\u00a0\nthat i want to swatch it against so this is the\nrare beauty one i'm already loving how that\u00a0\napplied and i'm gonna swatch it against the\u00a0\u00a0\nmarried foundation now this is not a bronzer stick\u00a0\nthis is a foundation stick that i purchased in a\u00a0\u00a0\ndeeper shade so i can use it as a bronzer because\u00a0\nmerit doesn't have a bronzer so i'll just show you\u00a0\u00a0\nthe difference in that one now i'm\u00a0\ngonna go into the makeup by mario\u00a0\u00a0\nand the makeup by mario is in the shade medium\nright there and then i'm gonna go and use my\u00a0\nnew one the new sticks in the shade terracotta\nhere are all the stick bronzers the first one is\u00a0\nthe rare beauty one it seems very velvety and soft\u00a0\u00a0\nthe second one is the merit one you can see it's\u00a0\na little bit deeper this one is the makeup by\u00a0\u00a0\nmario which is much deeper and the nude sticks\u00a0\nhas more of a red undertone so that's kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe difference in um the sticks let me apply\u00a0\nmore of the rare beauty so you guys can see\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is kind of what those shades look like\u00a0\ncompared to each other i really love all of them\u00a0\u00a0\nmy favorite type of undertone is the one that\u00a0\nlooks more like caramelly less red but i love\u00a0\u00a0\nthe ones that look um reddish too but for some\u00a0\nreason i think that the ones that look more like\u00a0\u00a0\ncaramel they look better on my face so this one\u00a0\nby red beauty it's kind of a combination of the\u00a0\u00a0\ncaramel shade and one of this too that has a\u00a0\nlittle bit of red undertone so we'll see how\u00a0\u00a0\nit applies to the face so i'm gonna apply it like\u00a0\nthis i'm just gonna draw right under my cheekbone\u00a0\u00a0\nand on my forehead and underneath here\u00a0\nfor now we'll see now i'm gonna use\u00a0\u00a0\nthe rare beauty brush which is the foundation\u00a0\nbrush i used and see how this applies\nright away it's very easy to use very easy you all\u00a0\nyou do is you dab and it just melts into the skin\u00a0\u00a0\nand gives it a nice shadow underneath the bone\u00a0\nsculpting your face it is so easy to use i love it\nso the undertone you can see that it does have\u00a0\nthat nice sunkissed look and not a burnt type\u00a0\u00a0\nof look however there is a tiny bit of\u00a0\nred undertone which is just the perfect\u00a0\u00a0\namount so i'm gonna apply a little bit more\u00a0\nbecause i want to be bronzed a little bit more\nso you can apply this with your fingers it's\u00a0\nvery emollient it just melts into the skin\u00a0\u00a0\nor you can apply it with a brush or a sponge\u00a0\na dampened sponge and it's obviously buildable\nso you saw that one layer was very light\u00a0\non the skin just providing that little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit of a shadow but when you apply it again\u00a0\nyou can build it up and it gives you that\u00a0\u00a0\nnice sunkissed look now i normally don't do my\u00a0\nnose but for the purpose of this video i will\nokay so for this i'm gonna use the small concealer\u00a0\nbrush by rare beauty and contour the nose\njust add a little bit more here this is so pretty\u00a0\ni'm loving it so i'm gonna use a different brush\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause my rare beauty brush still has concealer\u00a0\nthis is a brush by sephora so it's very similar\u00a0\u00a0\nto the real beauty brush and i will try\u00a0\noh yeah this is perfect for blending the\u00a0\u00a0\nbronzer on the nose so you can see how\u00a0\nbeautiful it comes toward the nose the\u00a0\u00a0\nface it's very lightweight very soft very skin\u00a0\nlike it melts into the skin it's just beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nanother way you can use this product is you can\u00a0\nadd it to your eyes so i'm gonna add this to my\u00a0\u00a0\neyes and add it into the crease and above just for\u00a0\na nice transition shade so i'm gonna use this real\u00a0\u00a0\ntechniques fluffy brush and go into the actual\u00a0\nproduct and try add it into the crease and above\u00a0\u00a0\nand see how this works on the eyes\nso just a little bit i touched the stick and you\u00a0\ncan see how beautiful it looks on the eyes there's\u00a0\u00a0\nno patchiness it just blends seamlessly into the\u00a0\nskin and the eye eyelid looks very sunkissed so\u00a0\u00a0\nlet's do this on this eye we're not going to do\u00a0\nmuch with the eyes today because it's mostly a\u00a0\u00a0\nbronzer review but i wanted to show you how this\u00a0\nlooks on the eyes as well so this product you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan use it both on the face and eyes you can just\u00a0\nadd a little bit of mascara and you can go ahead\u00a0\u00a0\nand start your day that's why i love products\u00a0\nthat you can use them for different purposes\u00a0\u00a0\nlook how fast everything blended so i just love\u00a0\nthat i'm gonna go into the rare beauty blush\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is the nearly neutral blush this is newer\u00a0\nin my collection and i'm going to apply this\u00a0\u00a0\nwith a sponge so just give the cheeks a little bit\u00a0\nmore color this is the perfect way to apply this\u00a0\u00a0\nblush i've noticed it seems that with a sponge it\u00a0\ngives it a lot of color to the cheek and it just\u00a0\u00a0\nmelts into the skin easily there's no sharp lines\u00a0\nyou can apply this with a brush as well but i\u00a0\u00a0\nsuggest you use a sponge i think it just gives it\u00a0\na more natural dewy look this shades the bronzer\u00a0\u00a0\nthe blush the foundation concealer they work very\u00a0\ngood together so for the eyes i'm gonna go in\u00a0\u00a0\nwith the rare beauty confident energy palette and\u00a0\nwe're not gonna do much i have the transition on\u00a0\u00a0\nalready i'm gonna add this pink into the crease\u00a0\nwith the same brush just to intensify this area\u00a0\u00a0\nand i think with my finger i'm going to use\u00a0\nthis mint color this is such a pretty color and\u00a0\u00a0\nput it all over the eyelid see that's\u00a0\nthis shades are so easy to use they look\u00a0\u00a0\nvery intimidating lots of shimmer in there but\u00a0\nthey look very soft on the eyes now i think\u00a0\u00a0\nfor the outer corner i'm trying to use this one\u00a0\njust a little bit to intensify the outer corner\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm going to use more of a flat brush and\u00a0\nlet's hope we're not going to have fallout now\nbut they are so soft on the eyes and easy to\u00a0\nblend and they have the perfect amount of shimmer\u00a0\u00a0\nthat looks beautiful so i think for the bottom\u00a0\nlash line i'm gonna use the bronzer again i'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna use a small flat brush like this this is by\u00a0\nmorphe and i'm gonna dip the top part of the brush\u00a0\u00a0\nand just add a little bit\u00a0\nunderneath the eyelid right here\nso we can tie in the bronzer and the transition\u00a0\nshade together i'm going to give you my final\u00a0\u00a0\nthoughts at the end for the inner corner i'm gonna\u00a0\nuse this mint again and with a brush and add a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle bit of highlight in the inner corner there\u00a0\ni'm gonna use the same shade for the brow bone\nand i'm gonna use the same shade just a little bit\u00a0\nin the inner corner on the bottom lash line here\u00a0\u00a0\njust to tie in that mint together i'm\u00a0\ngonna go ahead and apply mascara off\u00a0\u00a0\ncamera and i'm gonna use the laura geller\u00a0\nmascara and this is in the shade black\u00a0\u00a0\nso enjoy this intermission\u00a0\nand i will be right back\non and this is what the bronzer looks like with\u00a0\ntwo times application so the cheekbone right here\nthe nose is contoured and the forehead you can\u00a0\nintensify this as much as you want i wanted to\u00a0\u00a0\nstop here i wanted a soft nice sunkissed look so i\u00a0\ndidn't want it too too bronzy but definitely this\u00a0\u00a0\nshade is perfect if you have very fair skin like\u00a0\ni do i think the first shade works very beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nit's very golden sun kissed with a little bit of\u00a0\nburnt shade in it so i think this is a perfect\u00a0\u00a0\nshade for you i always wonder which shade i should\u00a0\npick up i was afraid that this would be too light\u00a0\u00a0\nbut i really love the caramel look inside when i\u00a0\nsee a bronzer online that has this caramel type of\u00a0\u00a0\nshade i usually like to go for that and i'm happy\u00a0\ni did i think it looks stunning but i would love\u00a0\u00a0\nto hear your thoughts for lips i'm thinking of\u00a0\nkeeping it very neutral and nude and i want to use\u00a0\u00a0\nthe morphe lipstick this is a cream product and\u00a0\nit's in the shade flirt it's a very nude looking\u00a0\u00a0\nlipstick so this is what it looks like very\u00a0\nsimilar to all the bronzers so let's apply this\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is very creamy very hydrating i did\u00a0\nnot use any liner at all but i do have a\u00a0\u00a0\nliner on this brush this is a lip brush by\u00a0\ni believe sephora i bought this from sephora\nand i usually like to use a lip brush to kind\u00a0\nof spread the product around and it comes with\u00a0\u00a0\na lid so i really love this this is the sephora\u00a0\nprofessional lip brush this look is complete i did\u00a0\u00a0\nnot use any powder i love the dewiness i only used\u00a0\npowder underneath my eyes but to recap everything\u00a0\u00a0\nmostly i've used rare beauty products the\u00a0\nfoundation concealer is stunning together i love\u00a0\u00a0\nit the blush is beautiful and now moving on to the\u00a0\nbronzer the bronzer by rare beauty in the shade\u00a0\u00a0\npower boost power boost which is the first shade\u00a0\nout of them all looks beautiful on fair skin or\u00a0\u00a0\nvery fair skin it gives it a nice sunkissed glowy\u00a0\nlook i love the caramel shade with a hint of a\u00a0\u00a0\nburnt reddish shade in it definitely recommend\u00a0\nthis bronzer stick i love how easy it applied\u00a0\u00a0\nhow beautiful it melted in on the skin again\u00a0\nit comes with a twist on the bottom for the\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct to come out and then goes back in i love\u00a0\nthat packaging is beautiful oh did you hear that\u00a0\u00a0\nso when you actually close it make sure you hear\u00a0\nthis that means it clicked into place i love this\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct and i haven't seen a lot of people use\u00a0\nit this way after you use it as a bronzer stick\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can actually dip your brush and actually use\u00a0\nthis on your eyelids you can just go ahead and use\u00a0\u00a0\nthis into the crease into the transition and all\u00a0\nover the eyelid the shade of brown that melts into\u00a0\u00a0\nthe skin so easy to blend there's no patchiness\u00a0\nthere's no oiliness to it and there's no dryness\u00a0\u00a0\nto it it's just a perfect perfect consistency for\u00a0\nyour eyelids as well i definitely recommend this\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct because you can use it as an eyeshadow\u00a0\nand as a bronzer now you know that most bronzers\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can use as eyeshadows as well but with this\u00a0\nbeing a cream bronzer i was a little bit hesitant\u00a0\u00a0\ni thought that it would be too oily or it would\u00a0\nnot show up on the eyelids but it's not too\u00a0\u00a0\noily at all and it just looks it dries like a\u00a0\nvery soft powder on the eyelid so i definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nrecommend it you can just use it for your eyes\u00a0\nif you don't bronze or you can use it for both so\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is a very good price very affordable as well\u00a0\ncompared to the other products i just showed you\u00a0\u00a0\nso i hope you enjoyed this review let me know if\u00a0\nyou picked this up or let me know what you think\u00a0\u00a0\nhow this product looks on the face if you enjoyed\u00a0\nthis review make sure you comment down below i\u00a0\u00a0\nwould love to hear your thoughts and if you're new\u00a0\nto my channel i would love for you to subscribe\u00a0\u00a0\ndown below it would help me out so so much and i\u00a0\nwould really appreciate it have a wonderful day\u00a0\u00a0\nalways be yourself and i cannot wait to see\u00a0\nyou in my next one love you guys bye you say",

I'm gonna zoom in\u00a0\na little bit and we are going to start applying\u00a0\u00a0\nsome makeup and I am going to go through some\u00a0\nof the points that I tried to pinpoint when I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ndoing a review and also some points that make me\u00a0\ngo when I hear other people saying them reviews so\u00a0\u00a0\nthe first thing I wanted to mention is actually\u00a0\ncalling a first impression a review and this is\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething that I used to do myself when I started\u00a0\nout in the beauty Community because I saw so many\u00a0\u00a0\nother people do it and with time I realized\u00a0\nwait this is not what a review is at all the\u00a0\u00a0\nreview is like after I've actually tried it out\u00a0\nand actually like know how this product is so I\u00a0\u00a0\nwill say there are definitely some videos on\u00a0\nmy YouTube channel when I started out when I\u00a0\u00a0\ncalled a first impression a review and before\u00a0\nrealizing that wait this isn't helpful at all\u00a0\u00a0\nand this actually isn't the review because this\u00a0\nis just me trying it out for the first time and\u00a0\u00a0\nI have no idea I'm just gonna use a little bit on\u00a0\nthis one to cover this up because I have no idea\u00a0\u00a0\nhow this is gonna work out over time or like if\u00a0\nI'm gonna like this after a bit and I still see\u00a0\u00a0\nsome people calling their first impressions makeup\u00a0\nreviews and what I would try to look for if you're\u00a0\u00a0\nlooking for an actual review is how long have that\u00a0\nperson does done YouTube because if they're just\u00a0\u00a0\nstarting out it might be that they're doing the\u00a0\nsame honest mistake as I did in the beginning\u00a0\u00a0\njust looking at what other people are doing\u00a0\nand trying to emulate that but if it's someone\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's been in the beauty Community for a bit and\u00a0\nthey're still calling a first impression a review\u00a0\u00a0\nI say that that is probably a little bit of a\u00a0\nsign of someone that's not really doing their due\u00a0\u00a0\ndiligence when it comes to reviews hashtag sorry\u00a0\nnot sorry the next thing is something that I feel\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it's an obvious it's an obvious thing to say\u00a0\nbut it's not as obvious to note this and that is\u00a0\u00a0\nof course anything that I would call cheating are\u00a0\nthey using filters or with the Michaela one which\u00a0\u00a0\nis when she I I do believe that she used falsies\u00a0\nin her makeup uh like her review of the mascara\u00a0\u00a0\nor like the sponsored post of her mascara I've\u00a0\nmet Michaela she's honestly super super sweet and\u00a0\u00a0\nshe's fairly new in the makeup community and even\u00a0\nthough she clearly did something she shouldn't do\u00a0\u00a0\nand I honestly think that yeah you should be told\u00a0\nthat like listen we we don't do that I still think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat there is plenty of space to grow that is\u00a0\nnot by far not even a top 10 the worst thing\u00a0\u00a0\na Beauty influencer has done in this space and\u00a0\nI'm honestly a little bit shocked at how hard\u00a0\u00a0\npeople are going at her because like yeah that's\u00a0\ndefinitely not a good thing but it in the grand\u00a0\u00a0\nscheme of things other people have done a lot of\u00a0\nreally shitty things and I just hope we don't see\u00a0\u00a0\nthis from her again I think that that and I've\u00a0\nalways said that I just judge people based on\u00a0\u00a0\nhow they get up and not based on how they fall\u00a0\nso yeah it's going to be interesting to see how\u00a0\u00a0\nthings go uh following this but that is one thing\u00a0\nto look for in reviews and it's easier said than\u00a0\u00a0\ndone are they cheating are they using filters\u00a0\nor do you think falsies are they saying that it\u00a0\u00a0\nis a 12 hour wear test even though they weren't\u00a0\nit for 20 minutes like these things are hard to\u00a0\u00a0\nnotice but sometimes you got feeling might be the\u00a0\nbest way I mean if someone is doing a review of a\u00a0\u00a0\nsmoothing primer and they're using a smoothing\u00a0\nfilter does it matter does it matter what they're\u00a0\u00a0\ntelling you or what they're showing you because\u00a0\nyou're not seeing anything or someone that's\u00a0\u00a0\ndoing a review of a mascara and saying that this\u00a0\nis elongating while they're putting falses on\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know like this does it does that matter or\u00a0\nsomeone saying that they have tried something out\u00a0\u00a0\nfor this is this is something for me people say\u00a0\nlike oh I've been trying this out for a really\u00a0\u00a0\nlong time and they say that it's not sponsored\u00a0\nbut the product came out like two days ago and\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it could be PR but sometimes I feel like\u00a0\npeople are a bit vague they're like not really\u00a0\u00a0\ntelling us how come you've been trying this out\u00a0\nfor so long or have you been trying this out\u00a0\u00a0\nfor so long I feel like sometimes trust is all\u00a0\nyou have as a beauty reviewer this is I've been\u00a0\u00a0\nloving this Foundation it's the dream matte mousse\u00a0\nit's so good I know I know it's so surprising I've\u00a0\u00a0\nbeen coming back to this one but I've really been\u00a0\nenjoying it as a beauty influencer all you have\u00a0\u00a0\nis your the trust between you and your viewers\u00a0\nand if they don't trust new reviews then like\u00a0\u00a0\nyou are of no value to people anymore and then of\u00a0\ncourse you can have different preferences and this\u00a0\u00a0\nis what we're going to come into like in a bit\u00a0\nbut I do think that as a makeup reviewer if you\u00a0\u00a0\nget caught lying or cheating about a review it's\u00a0\nreally hard to get that trust back because people\u00a0\u00a0\nare going to be like okay so that wasn't true is\u00a0\nthis true and it's it's not easy to see things\u00a0\u00a0\nsuch as like filters and stuff like that and this\u00a0\nis why like I don't I mean you can see everything\u00a0\u00a0\nin my skin I don't use any filters on YouTube\u00a0\nI don't review makeup on like Tick Tock or uh\u00a0\u00a0\nInstagram or anything like that I just I showcase\u00a0\nthings and then I review them here on my YouTube\u00a0\u00a0\nchannel and I think that's also a different thing\u00a0\nif you're just doing pretty makeup and showing it\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't care if you're retouching it but if you're\u00a0\nreviewing a foundation and saying how beautiful it\u00a0\u00a0\nis and that you've been trying it for a really\u00a0\nlong time and it gives you Flawless skin and\u00a0\u00a0\nyou're using a filter it does make me question\u00a0\nyou a little bit and that's also a reason why I\u00a0\u00a0\nstarted doing some of my makeup videos for tick\u00a0\ntock not on my phone because Tick Tock does put\u00a0\u00a0\na filter on your videos I filmed them with this\u00a0\ncamera and then I make them into a short or I make\u00a0\u00a0\nthem into a tick tock and upload them that way in\u00a0\nthat way I'm able to keep like my texture and all\u00a0\u00a0\nof that so everybody does things differently and\u00a0\nI'm not saying that I'm the best but I do try to\u00a0\u00a0\nthink about like am I am I showing the product\u00a0\nthe way that you're gonna be able to experience\u00a0\u00a0\nit because if I'm here trying to explain to you\u00a0\nwhy I like or why I dislike a product and you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan't see any of the things that I'm explaining\u00a0\nthe this does my review even mean something or\u00a0\u00a0\nis it just cheater chatter filling an empty space\u00a0\nanother thing that I like to look for in reviews\u00a0\u00a0\nand especially when it comes to eyeshadow when\u00a0\nI am deciding if I want to try a brand when I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nlooking for reviews which I will say I don't look\u00a0\nat reviews as much anymore as I used to a while\u00a0\u00a0\nago because now if I buy something it's because I\u00a0\nwant to review it myself and I don't want to have\u00a0\u00a0\nlike opinions from others to like influence me\u00a0\nbefore I get a chance to try it myself unless it's\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething that I if I already know the formula\u00a0\nfrom a brand I don't care as much but if I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ntrying something for the first time I try to not\u00a0\nget influence what by what other people feel about\u00a0\u00a0\nthat formula about that brand or about anything\u00a0\nlike that but I will say back when I was trying to\u00a0\u00a0\ndecide what eyeshadow do I want to try what brands\u00a0\ndo I want to get into I realized that one of the\u00a0\u00a0\nmost important things was do they use the same\u00a0\ntechnique as me because I have been disappointed\u00a0\u00a0\nby quite a few uh makeup things realizing that we\u00a0\ndon't use the same technique and I don't want to\u00a0\u00a0\nuse their technique I want to use my technique\u00a0\nand sometimes I get disappointed and I also\u00a0\u00a0\nsee sometimes people using my favorite eyeshadow\u00a0\nformulas or my favorite uh or my favorite bronzers\u00a0\u00a0\nor foundations or concealers or powders and I see\u00a0\nthem use them in a totally different technique and\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm like oh this makes sense for example I rarely\u00a0\nstart with a transition shade because I feel like\u00a0\u00a0\nthat just lightens up everything that goes on\u00a0\ntop and just makes stuff look diffused and not\u00a0\u00a0\nas pigmented and not as deep and when I see people\u00a0\nfor example start out a bright colorful look with\u00a0\u00a0\na pastel and on the crease I already know that\u00a0\nwe're not going to have the same preferences\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen it comes to makeup because they are gonna\u00a0\nprobably think that this palette is going to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe they're not going to prefer something that\u00a0\nis as like pigmented or as bright as I am they\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to start with a transition shade first and I\u00a0\nvery very rarely do that and that is something to\u00a0\u00a0\nkeep in mind for you as well like are people using\u00a0\nthe same techniques as you are do you want because\u00a0\u00a0\nsometimes I also see people only starting with the\u00a0\ndarkest shade all the time and then when I try it\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'm not even able to build one Shadow on top\u00a0\nof each other because I like to start with the\u00a0\u00a0\nmiddle shade and I'll blend out the edge with the\u00a0\nlighter shade and then I'll add I have something\u00a0\u00a0\nhere that's itchy me I think it's like a cat or\u00a0\nsomething and then I like to build a darker shade\u00a0\u00a0\non top because I feel like that usually gets the\u00a0\nbest results when it comes to blending and when\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm not even able to build one one dark shade on\u00a0\ntop I realized the reason why I'm not liking this\u00a0\u00a0\nis because we're using so different techniques\u00a0\nand they're just looking for other things in their\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup and that's just something to to look for\u00a0\nwhat kind of techniques are they doing are they\u00a0\u00a0\ndoing baking or they're only using cream products\u00a0\ndo they set their products with powder and if they\u00a0\u00a0\nare not doing what you're doing you might not like\u00a0\nit the way that they like it and this also comes\u00a0\u00a0\ndown to preferences try to find people that have\u00a0\nthe same preference as you if you're looking for\u00a0\u00a0\nsomeone to review eyeshadow for you try to see if\u00a0\nthey already love some eyeshadow from us that you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow that you love for example I saw someone that\u00a0\nreally hated one of my favorite eyeshadow formulas\u00a0\u00a0\nand I was so surprised because I was like what\u00a0\ndo you mean our makeup styles look fairly similar\u00a0\u00a0\num like it looks fairly similar we were using um\u00a0\nsign up the same techniques but then she mentioned\u00a0\u00a0\nthat her face favorite formula was morphe and\u00a0\nI actually don't like morphe eyeshadows and\u00a0\u00a0\nthat made me realize oh we just have different\u00a0\npreferences we just look for different stuff in\u00a0\u00a0\neyeshadows so she probably would have looked at\u00a0\nmy reviews and been like why don't you love my\u00a0\u00a0\nfavorite brand and that's the way it is sometimes\u00a0\nand there are plenty of people whose reviews I\u00a0\u00a0\ntrust for some things and not for other things\u00a0\nbecause we have wildly different preferences\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen it comes to what we prefer in makeup what\u00a0\nwe would like the end result to look like and\u00a0\u00a0\nhow we work with makeup it is not up to me to\u00a0\ndecide for other people how they're going to do\u00a0\u00a0\ntheir makeup but it is up to me to differentiate\u00a0\nwhich people I can trust depending on if we have\u00a0\u00a0\nsimilar preferences or not for example I cannot\u00a0\nuse glitter glue because glitter glue pretty much\u00a0\u00a0\nalways creases on me so when I see people using\u00a0\nglitter glue I'm like I'm I think I'm gonna have\u00a0\u00a0\nto like look at other reviews as well because\u00a0\nI can't use glitter glue so I need to make sure\u00a0\u00a0\nthat these eyeshadows work without glitter glue\u00a0\nas well but I always spray my eyeshadows for\u00a0\u00a0\nexample before I put them on because I want them\u00a0\nto be as foiled as possible and I try to avoid\u00a0\u00a0\num how's this looking this is\u00a0\nlooking great I try to avoid Fallout\u00a0\u00a0\nbut if you're the kind of person you only want\u00a0\nto apply your eyeshadows with a dry brush for me\u00a0\u00a0\nyou're going to get a totally different result\u00a0\nand maybe listening to me isn't the best idea\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I don't want that result I also don't want\u00a0\nthat Fallout sometimes though I'll use my finger\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I think that that gets a similar result\u00a0\nespecially now when I have somewhat shorter nails\u00a0\u00a0\nbut yeah it's all different depending on how you\u00a0\ndo your makeup what you want your makeup to do\u00a0\u00a0\nfor you how you want it to look in the end it's\u00a0\nalso very very important that's looking really\nI'm so impressed so let's talk about what things\u00a0\nI think we should be looking for in reviews then\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat things that I look for in reviews and\u00a0\nof course there are things like we all have\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent things I'm gonna try this one for the\u00a0\nfirst time I have mine in Sahara we all have\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent things that we look for in reviews\u00a0\nme for example I don't care where it is made\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't care how much product is in there unless\u00a0\nit is a product that I go through like eye primer\u00a0\u00a0\nconcealer if it's if it's an eyeshadow I don't go\u00a0\nthrough eyeshadow I don't care wow that's pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't care how much is in there but we all\u00a0\nhave different things that we're looking for\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna let you know what I look for in reviews\u00a0\nI don't know why I'm price but this is so much\u00a0\u00a0\num creamier than I thought it was gonna be why\u00a0\nis that so surprising to me another thing that\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't like when people do reviews because\u00a0\nI don't do it myself is when people set their\u00a0\u00a0\neyeshadow with like powder or a see-through like\u00a0\na bone colored mat or a for them skin color matte\u00a0\u00a0\nbefore they go in with eyeshadow because I don't\u00a0\ndo that and when people do that and then say oh\u00a0\u00a0\nthis isn't pigmented I'm like well you kind of\u00a0\nset the primer so the primer is not sticking\u00a0\u00a0\nto the eye shadows and also sometimes when I\u00a0\nsee people that really love neutrals when they\u00a0\u00a0\nreview colorful eyeshadows and they're saying that\u00a0\nthey're not blending as effortlessly or anything\u00a0\u00a0\nlike that and not understanding that different\u00a0\npigments work in different ways and you might\u00a0\u00a0\nneed to switch up your techniques or switch up\u00a0\nyour brushes when you are working with something\u00a0\u00a0\nthat doesn't naturally blend into your skin tone\u00a0\nlike a blue or a purple unless you're a Smurf and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen of course they do blend in seamlessly but I\u00a0\ndo think that some sometimes we do need to switch\u00a0\u00a0\nup our techniques when we're using pastels when\u00a0\nwe're using Neons Neons do not build don't try to\u00a0\u00a0\nuse a neon as a crease shade and then build on top\u00a0\nof it it's not going to work because Neons have\u00a0\u00a0\nso much white chalky pigment in them to make them\u00a0\nthat color and again this is just me being in love\u00a0\u00a0\nwith eyeshadows and being in love with colorful\u00a0\neyeshadows and just looking for these different\u00a0\u00a0\nthings when it comes to reviews I'm actually going\u00a0\nto be doing a look mixing these two together this\u00a0\u00a0\nis the new Muse palette by Cosmic brushes looks\u00a0\nlike this and this is the serenity palette which\u00a0\u00a0\nis the older palette that they came up with I saw\u00a0\nsome people asking if I thought they were the same\u00a0\u00a0\nthey definitely have some colors that are a little\u00a0\nsimilar especially three colors but everything\u00a0\u00a0\nelse is very different this one for example does\u00a0\nnot have any blues in it it has two purples and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen two like this one is like a little bit of a\u00a0\npurple I guess like a purple matte but there are\u00a0\u00a0\nno Blues in this one and in this other palette let\u00a0\nme actually see if I can pull it up next to each\u00a0\u00a0\nother there's a lot of Blues in the first Cosmic\u00a0\nbrushes palette the one that is on the top here\u00a0\u00a0\nbut there are no Blues in the new one there are\u00a0\nthree green shadows in these palettes that are\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit similar you can see the the two like\u00a0\nbright greens here but this is darker and this is\u00a0\u00a0\nlighter and I will say I have swatched these side\u00a0\nby side they are not the same there are no dupes\u00a0\u00a0\nbetween the palettes but there are three greens\u00a0\nthat are a little similar to the point where\u00a0\u00a0\nyou're like you see them in the pan and then when\u00a0\nyou Swatch them you're like oh no they're not the\u00a0\u00a0\nsame but they're a little similar like the bright\u00a0\ngreen there's a dark cool tone green as well but\u00a0\u00a0\nthe one in the new palette is significantly darker\u00a0\nthan the one in the in the older palette but I do\u00a0\u00a0\nhope that the next palette that she comes out with\u00a0\nuh doesn't have my I love greens but doesn't have\u00a0\u00a0\nany of these like warmer greens because um I would\u00a0\nhate for people to think that like she's coming up\u00a0\u00a0\nwith another palette that's the same but just\u00a0\nso you know I did Swatch them side by side and\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're not dupes but there are a couple of Shades\u00a0\nthree to be exact there are on the similar scale\u00a0\u00a0\nbut not dupes I am actually going to be trying out\u00a0\nthese two shades together this is a peach matte\u00a0\u00a0\nand this is like a grunchy uh greenish Brown and\u00a0\nI'm gonna be trying those out together and we'll\u00a0\u00a0\nsee how these I have no idea if they're gonna work\u00a0\nor not but I love Cosmic brushes and I want to\u00a0\u00a0\ntry something that's like a neutral with a Twist\u00a0\ntogether with this lip color okay when I look for\u00a0\u00a0\nreviews especially like I said now with colorful\u00a0\nShadows when I look for reviews with colorful\u00a0\u00a0\nShadows I look for people that use the same\u00a0\ntechniques as me that likes the same result as\u00a0\u00a0\nme and that understands that you need to switch up\u00a0\nyour techniques and need to switch up your brushes\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen it comes to different colors that's that's\u00a0\nwhat I look for myself and then of course I try\u00a0\u00a0\nto see do we like the same Brands when it comes\u00a0\nto like foundations and stuff oh my there are\u00a0\u00a0\nso many so many concealers and foundations that I\u00a0\ntried as a fluffier that I tried when I first came\u00a0\u00a0\ninto the beauty community that people were loving\u00a0\nand I just couldn't for the life of me understood\u00a0\u00a0\nunderstand why anyone would love these because\u00a0\nI thought they were horrible remember that Urban\u00a0\u00a0\nDecay all-nighter Foundation oh my God I hated\u00a0\nthat Foundation it was like liquid lipstick on\u00a0\u00a0\nmy skin and I realized me and the person who\u00a0\nloved it we don't have the same skin type\u00a0\u00a0\nwe don't have the same preferences and\u00a0\nshe was like 15 years younger than me\u00a0\u00a0\nand I was like oh oh okay that makes sense\u00a0\nso when it comes to foundations and when it\u00a0\u00a0\ncomes to powders and concealers I try to look\u00a0\nfor and also like cream products this goes for\u00a0\u00a0\ncream products too what kind of skin type do\u00a0\nthey have are they oily are they dry do they\u00a0\u00a0\nprefer to have a dewy face do they prefer\u00a0\nto have a face that's not set down because\u00a0\u00a0\nI like my makeup to set down I want to be able to\u00a0\ntouch my face where do they live do they live in\u00a0\u00a0\na dry climate do they live in a humid climate\u00a0\nwhere do they live it makes such a difference\u00a0\u00a0\nme moving from Sweden that is fairly not maybe dry\u00a0\nbut like it's dry during the winter but definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nnot humid Sweden is not humid moving to a humid\u00a0\nclimate everything acts differently so if you\u00a0\u00a0\nhave oily skin living in a humid climate and\u00a0\ntaking advice for someone has dry skin living\u00a0\u00a0\na dry climate you're probably not going to enjoy\u00a0\nthe same product I'm just throwing it out there\u00a0\u00a0\nI think this blended into each other pretty\u00a0\nokay I am gonna layer one more Shadow on top\u00a0\u00a0\ntoday I'm doing what I said I don't normally do\u00a0\nbut I really wanted it to pull a little Peach and\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's the thing with transition Shades they will\u00a0\nchange whatever you put on top and if you don't\u00a0\u00a0\nwant it to change don't do a transition shade I'm\u00a0\ngonna switch to the Muse palette because I want\u00a0\u00a0\nto use I think I'm going to use this one it's\u00a0\nlike a dark Plum and then I'm going to use the\u00a0\u00a0\ntwo duochromes that are in here this one here\u00a0\nthat has like a warm base with like an almost\u00a0\u00a0\ntealy Sheen it's super pretty and then this one\u00a0\nthat has like a purple with a more minty Sheen\u00a0\u00a0\nso I think I'm going to be using those and I am so\u00a0\nexcited because I really think that this is going\u00a0\u00a0\nto turn out super pretty okay so things that I do\u00a0\nlook for is age climate preferences skin type and\u00a0\u00a0\nof course what kind of technique are they using\u00a0\nwhat kind of results are they ending up having\u00a0\u00a0\nand I I mean sometimes when I want to try\u00a0\nsomething that's a little bit more glowy for\u00a0\u00a0\nexample and I am like I said I have combo skin I\u00a0\nam 39 and I live in a humid climate I will see if\u00a0\u00a0\nmy friend Heather Austin likes it because she is\u00a0\nalso in her 30s she lives in a human climate and\u00a0\u00a0\nshe has oily skin so if she tries out something\u00a0\nand she really likes it that is usually a green\u00a0\u00a0\nlight for me because we have a similar taste when\u00a0\nit comes to makeup products and I feel exactly the\u00a0\u00a0\nopposite when it comes to my other friend Samantha\u00a0\nMarch she has dry skin and she has acne prone skin\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich I do not have and she also doesn't really\u00a0\nlove foundations and she lives in a dry climate\u00a0\u00a0\ndry skin dry climate and she's looking for totally\u00a0\ndifferent things with her foundation if she loves\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething I might not like she put one of the\u00a0\nfoundations that I had in my yearly worst products\u00a0\u00a0\nof the year she put in her best products of the\u00a0\nyear do I think she's lying oh it's not of course\u00a0\u00a0\nnot we just have wildly different preferences when\u00a0\nit comes to makeup due to having wildly different\u00a0\u00a0\ncanvases to work with so I'm gonna try the darker\u00a0\nof the duochromes the one that's called ambient\u00a0\u00a0\nand I did spray this one a little bit before but\u00a0\nI want to put not too much of this one out here\u00a0\u00a0\nto be a little darker before we go into that\u00a0\nlighter one look at me doing a neutral look\u00a0\u00a0\nwho am I right I don't usually do neutral looks\u00a0\nif you haven't caught on with this on my channel\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm more about the bright and the colorful but\u00a0\nI do love a good dramatic eye look I will say\u00a0\u00a0\nand if it's dramatic I can really enjoy a neutral\u00a0\nas well or as I like to call it a neutral with a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle bit of twist that I do think that this is\u00a0\nit's a little bit more grungy a little darker and\u00a0\u00a0\nsome duochromes please let me know down below\u00a0\nwhat are some of the things that when you hear\u00a0\u00a0\nit in a review you instantly go no absolutely not\u00a0\nthat's not gonna be for me so this is the lighter\u00a0\u00a0\none that's called antique and I'm gonna put that\u00a0\nin the inner part and I think you can see there's\u00a0\u00a0\na difference this one is more of a dark teal with\u00a0\nthe plum base and this one is almost more like a\u00a0\u00a0\nmint with a slightly lighter purpley\u00a0\nbase really interesting together\noh and if you weren't able to catch this um this\u00a0\npalette The Muse one before it's sold out she is\u00a0\u00a0\nrestocking it it is not limited edition according\u00a0\nto the owner so just keep your eyes open she will\u00a0\u00a0\nrestock it and I do have a code with this brand my\u00a0\ncode isn't Jessica if you want to save some money\u00a0\u00a0\noff on this brand but yeah I know a bunch of you\u00a0\nwanted to buy it and it was sold out but she is\u00a0\u00a0\nrestocking it that is actually turning out to be\u00a0\nquite interesting neutral look what do I want to\u00a0\u00a0\nhave in my inner corners I think I'm gonna bring\u00a0\nout a map pastel by colourpop because colourpop\u00a0\u00a0\ndoesn't work a lot of really good masked pastels\u00a0\nand I'm gonna put that in my inner corner I think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's gonna be that's gonna be the last one okay\u00a0\nI put some lashes on and I'm actually going to be\u00a0\u00a0\nusing this oldie but a goody orange you glad and\u00a0\nI'm going to be using this pastel peach in here\u00a0\u00a0\nand we are gonna see because I remember that I\u00a0\nused to use that sometimes in my inner corners\u00a0\u00a0\nto get something that was like a light peach but\u00a0\nnot like super blinding maybe I should put a white\u00a0\u00a0\non top but maybe this is enough I really like\u00a0\nhow this is looking when I hear people describe\u00a0\u00a0\nstuff as dewy or when they are describing their\u00a0\nskin as very dry I immediately know that we're\u00a0\u00a0\nprobably not going to be enjoying the same kind\u00a0\nof uh makeup so that makes me go like oh we're\u00a0\u00a0\nprobably not gonna like this and also when people\u00a0\nsay that they prefer like easy there but not their\u00a0\u00a0\nclean makeup just like a shimmer across the lid\u00a0\nI also know that we're probably not looking for\u00a0\u00a0\nthe same things when it comes to eyeshadows okay\u00a0\nlet me zoom out and we can end this video with\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know conclusions I hope that this really\u00a0\ncame through in this video but I just wanted\u00a0\u00a0\nto say most people are not Liars most people are\u00a0\nvery genuine and honest in their opinions and just\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause they're not 100 matching your opinions\u00a0\ndoesn't mean that they're lying or that they're\u00a0\u00a0\ntelling you something that isn't true they're just\u00a0\ntelling you their truth and how they are feeling\u00a0\u00a0\nabout a product I have people screaming at me in\u00a0\ncaps lock every week on my channel calling me a\u00a0\u00a0\nliar because I didn't like a product that they\u00a0\nliked and I don't know what to tell you maybe I\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't like the same things that that you like I\u00a0\ndon't like super glowy dewy cheeks I don't like\u00a0\u00a0\nsuper like the super dewy foundations especially\u00a0\nnot the ones that have Shimmer in them we might\u00a0\u00a0\nnot like the same things and that is totally okay\u00a0\njust make sure that when you are actually basing\u00a0\u00a0\nyour purchasing decisions on something make sure\u00a0\nthat you are listening to a person why they are\u00a0\u00a0\nliking something why are they liking this thing\u00a0\nand why are they not liking this thing because I\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to make sure and maybe this is the biggest\u00a0\nred flag when it comes to reviews When someone\u00a0\u00a0\ntells you they love something or hate something\u00a0\nbut they don't tell you why why is this the best\u00a0\u00a0\nthing since lastpread why is this the most awful\u00a0\nproduct of 2023 what about this product makes it\u00a0\u00a0\nspecial in any way of the spectrum when people\u00a0\njust say I love it run down walk by buy it now\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm just left with a why what's so special\u00a0\nabout this product what about this product\u00a0\u00a0\nmakes it amazing or when people say this is\u00a0\nawful I hate this product why did you hate it\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause the reason why you hate it or the reason\u00a0\nwhy you love it might be the reason why I feel\u00a0\u00a0\nthe opposite about it and I think that that might\u00a0\nbe the biggest thing to take away from this video\u00a0\u00a0\nbut maybe the two biggest things to take away\u00a0\nfrom this video please only watch the reviews\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom people that actually explain why they feel\u00a0\nthe way they do about a product and remember that\u00a0\u00a0\njust because somebody doesn't feel the way that\u00a0\nyou do about a product doesn't mean that either\u00a0\u00a0\nof you are incorrect or lying it just means that\u00a0\nyou have different preferences when it comes to\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup if you're interested in any of the things\u00a0\nthat I use today on my face they're gonna be in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe description box also don't forget to check\u00a0\nout Nikki's video I'm so excited to hear what\u00a0\u00a0\nshe has to say I hope you're having an amazing\u00a0\nday and I will see you in my next video bye\nforeign\n[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]",

                "comment": "I think \u201cmakeup education\u201d (for lack of a better term) plays a huge role in this. I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage.

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators.

        "transcript_text": "hello hello It's Annabelle [Music] I'm very happy to see you today\nfor this new video on the program I'm discovering the Sephora Ker the compact mineral\nthe little product of in one so two in one why it's a fund of foundation and a\nfinishing powder then either you use it as a foundation and powder or you use it\nonly as a foundation and you powder with another powder or you use another\nfoundation and you come to powder the one with this this little product today I\n'm going to use it in two in one I'm going to use it as a foundation and a finishing powder\nbecause I tell myself that if it works so well it's that 'she wins as long as she saves\ntime it's a 91% natural product I don't want to think about what\n's in the other percent that's left it's a product it's a product we finished\nnatural a light to medium coverage adjustable it is a product that is suitable so\nwe rati super wide dry normal mixed thanks and sensitive I don't know what other\nskin types are left but in any case it is suitable for all these skin types so why\nnot test it is sold so it is sold with a small double-colored sponge on the\nside dark for a color a color a much higher coverage and if\nyou want infinite much finer and well we apply it with the white side why it's\nnot because I just did my complexion here is quite simply a little additional info\nbefore find myself without make-up you're not dreaming I messed up my hair color\nI had white roots I went to buy my color and like an idiot a\nbeginner I let myself buy a new color from a new number\nhere we don't care about the brand but you have to pay attention to the number and I have it existed\nat a 912 so I bought the 912 it's a milk it's a very light ash blonde\nwhat me I do it's an 8 one mixed with nine the 8 1 pou r the ash side\non 9 for the much lighter side and it works well and there 912 I thought in\nmy little head that it was going to do it so I think it could have done it if I\nhadn't used the blue shampoo that was supplied with I think that was\nmy mistake but I will not go and check because here I usually use\nmy applex shampoo to wash my skull immediately after coloring and there\nI have used the blue shampoo that came with it and my roots have turned blue\nso I have a much less Smurf look because I've already washed my hair\ntwice the color is fading the blue is fading but so here I am wait a few\nmore days to redo a color on top I wouldn't want to sensitize my hair anyway\nI'll find you on this bin with serum here you go without make-up my daily care\nis applied I applied my primeur from home at the same time Lanc\u00f4me the 24-hour moisturizing\nprimer serum that I love it really gives you a photoshopped face without a filter\nhere's what else I did I applied my concealer from Fenty beauty\nin test last month it's really not bad j I like the result well well here I\nhave pockets there are small fine lines but it's still luminous I'm going to apply\nnow and well not as usual I'm going to apply this mineral care foundation\nfrom Sephora j I have apprehensions about the color well well here I would put some\nin the neck and then I quickly put my hands next to my face I will\napply on the other hand a side with the black side which must provide coverage higher\nand I will apply the foundation on the other side with the white side which\nshould give you lighter coverage here I am going to attack from the light side\nso I come to take some material from the white side and I don't know how I go\nabout it I call you I slip I apply small ones my god it's Orange good bah it's Orange\nI've come to make appliques I don't like [Music] I don't\nlike I don't like this I don't like this powder puff I don't like it's\nyuck\nI don't like it they say apply it with any good apply with this ear but I don't like\nit's not practical what me I don't have it in hand I don't know he will still do that I\ntest with a brush it will also make me test with a sponge a lambda sponge\nbecause frankly I don't like this thing and I remember having tested a\nfoundation from make-up\nwhich had the same sponge and gold system this foundation is still a lot\ncheaper than the make-up make-up For Ever foundation but the effect is not pleasant with\nthis sponge in any case it spreads very well oh yes it's true that a little a little\na little mirror in the trains it's not bad it doesn't make it thick to tell you\nthat it corrects redness well I have trouble with this big sponge there you're going to\napply me a little bit there but I'm afraid of making it too orange so I was Albert\ngood if necessary I'll come and polish it with a brush on the white side and apply well\nwell of course that's not not wet there is no need to dry it's really very\nvery pretty infinitely natural so I find that for a feelimat and well yes it's\nmy but I find that there is a certain light in my mirror which is just in\nunderneath I find that the light is quite pretty\nyes it's matte but I would say a matte a matte that doesn't weigh you down that's good so I\ndon't already like the white side so I don't even dare to think that it's going to make me feel bad black side\nhere I take\nsome I just applied a little like that then I'm going to come and stretch because\nno but you're going to tell me she makes a crazy movie but it's not pleasant what it's\nnot pleasant this thing c it's not pleasant so already on the white side I would say it was\nsmoother for a coverage that's lighter but then this thing you have the impression\nthat you think the face what\nI don't like oh there it starts well\nso without pressing j I have a bread\nI don't like I don't like it's not comfortable that's what I feel like attacking my\nskin and then I find that the black side I won't put more but I find that it's\nless uniform quickly here I have to find the small side with the small\nmirror\nbut the result is pretty I'm not going to tell you the opposite here I apply it good\nin my couple because there I think that I'm going to skip it on the white side\nbecause the other I have the impression of using pumice stone I put some in my\nneck come towards my ears no it's pretty I like it a lot so I would say that this side\nwith the sponge black side it's less bright it's less bright tell you that\nit's much thicker no I find that the side I have applied on the white side\nand brighter that worked more easily if I may say you heard\nmy complaints I finally frankly don't like that me it's a nightmare at the level of the ports\nso my base already blurs the pores enormously there for the Suddenly I have absolutely\nnothing left, however I will tell you that the side that I applied white to neither calf\nof my pores and a little less blurry so it's really played out I want I stop\ntalking about the hair only there this side there this side there is much more and much\nmore blurred but it's not much to play for given that it's a shingles product\nI'm going to leave it like that because well it's a foundation a\nfinishing powder so I'm not going to apply powder it's not bad I like the principle\nin all case what I'm going to do is since it's a mineral foundation between\na powder and a between a powder and a powder and a foundation I'm going to apply on one\nside some farfours on the other side I'm going to apply cream shadows and we'll\nsee the difference I'm finishing my make-up and I'll get back to you here is my make-up is finished\nwhat did I do on each side since I did different things it does\nnot necessarily show but I explain to you on this side I decided to apply\nonly cream products so I applied the bronzer Revolution the round crime that\nwent great well applied on the foundation there was no problem\nwhere I had a little more problems it was with the blush the cream blush from the\npowerful love collection from Kiko j I wanted to apply this one and I realize so it's\nnot badly applied far from it but I find it I don't find it\nI find it a little marbled here I find it less beautiful than on other backgrounds here it is is\nmy it's my opinion I share it with you on this side I applied powder products\nI applied the bronzer the coloricone from weit and wide on this side it\napplied like nothing and the Color full matte from Sephora as a blush so I wanted to\napply blushers of roughly the same color, here it is, it's\na little round, a little parma pink who knows how to apply it very well on\nthis background of foundation so I will tell you that the cream products be careful on this foundation\nbecause here it is 55 years old then for my eyes I applied the headlights of the\nJewell tartlet I did something fairly new, fairly neutral I'm going to go live my life\nand then I'll meet you in a few seconds for you and tonight for me this morning it\nwas 9 a.m. when I applied this two-in-one product from Sephora the\nFontain compact mineral heart and powder all in the same little case so the color\ngood it's debatable we agree let's ignore the color so it\nwas 9 a.m. it's almost 7 p.m. I don't I did as usual no retouching I just\nreapplied a little bit of my cup from MAC cosmetics here is the result this\nmorning it was rather infinite natural matte which was I would say luminous from the inside\ndo you follow me it was a glow that came out of the foundation that made\nyour skin here it was not a return of light from the materials but your most beautiful\nseemed luminous from the inside here here I am here here is my feeling I applied it\nso with the little sponge I can't tell you that I'm a fan of this damn\nsponge whether it's on the white side for them a rather very light coverage and or\non the black side to make it look more\nthe white side is still much more pleasant but I don't find it it's very malleable\nso I'm going to test anyway on my next applications with a brush or a beauty\nblender sponge or equivalent without retouching here is the result I think it's not so bad\nI didn't apply anything else I didn't apply a powder on it so it's raw formwork\nyes I had put on a primer the primer from Lanc\u00f4me which is a moisturizing serum it's\nnot particularly mattifying here [Music] I'm luminous yes but when I touch\nthere is no all poack effects yes it's bright because there it's a little\nhairy a little bit here towards the chin yes it's an effect a little a little a little bright\na little chubby probably but I don't really find that catastrophic I didn't\ntouch anything maybe q I would have done a little touch-up during the day I might be\nbetter but that's not the case for the ports the pores are still erased at the level\nof the nose I don't have any displacement of material there we still see a a little bit my little\nred spot but honestly it hasn't really camouflaged my little red spot\nfrom the beginning I think that here are the little red spots [Music] it doesn't really hide\nthem erase we can see the\nsmall red marks that I can have but it's not a disaster here 9am 7pm finally\na big 9am here but 7pm well well now it's not bad there is no displacement\nof matter for information of this side I had applied powder shadows the powder shadows\nheld on pretty well I didn't apply a fixing spray I'm really going to\nsee what it looks like raw on this side I had applied\ncream headlights and I found that my blush that I applied my blush which is always urs on my\ndesk I had applied the double blush from the powerful love range from Kiko and I\ndidn't find it so extraordinary on this foundation even though I love this blush and\nwe see that like the materials this side is much more [Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nhere it is in any case it's rather a nice surprise frankly I would not have bet on it\nbut but the surprise is good I will continue to manhandle it and I would be happy to\nreally manhandle it despite the color which is a bit tendentious but hey here I am continuing\nto test it see you at the end of February yes for the for the results on this article\nhere I hope in any case that this you will have liked the video if so don't forget\nthe little blue thumbs up it's more than fun if it's not done yet\nwell don't wait any longer subscribe it's a video every Friday at 6 p.m.\nParis time in case I have the idea of \u200b\u200bgiving you a little surprise or\nif Ben you think you're missing one of my videos and you don't want to miss my videos\nactivate the little bell and then and then if you still want to

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

She lies about the false lashes and then didn&#39;t respond about it at all and she hid the sponsored statement and doubled down on her lies and made a joke out of her actions in subsequent videos. She has used filters too.  She has yet to apologize and she shouldn&#39;t be given the benefit of the doubt at all. That ship sailed.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

the\npowder tart the smooth operator it's downright awesome and for now I didn't fall for\nthe other powders on the program a base from MAC factor a mascara from Beauty a concealer\nfrom Maybelline a blush palette from LH cosmetics and a Nabla bronzer as well as\na lipstick from Beauty Bay so beauty bear me I don't know if you are used to\nusing this site but it's the first time I tested because they announced that it could\ndeliver to the United Emirates so I said to myself good well I will test conclusion I was delivered\nalmost 15 days after my order I had a nice discount ok but be careful\nI paid shipping costs and the discount I said goodbye goodbye the discount so I paid\nfull price and frankly lookfantastic makes me t less big less big customs fees so\nthere I don't know I don't think I'll redo an order on beauty bed immediately but it will\nallow me to finally discover products from different brands so here I am\nhappy all the same I find you without make-up for the test of all these products my hair\nis attached my daily care is applied let's go for the application of my new\nmake-up of the month first the first product that I will apply avoiding my dark circles is\nthe base from Max Factor the miracle bonus to tame my T zone which is apparently brilliant\nso I shake a little bit which apparently is very very which does a great job and in addition\nthe price well the price is super hot it makes you a little little milk a little milky and I just\napply well well mainly guess where on my T zone the rest I will do it again a little bit and\nI just apply on the contours so yes the rest of my face except my T zone is not\nnot rticularly thanks but after nothing prevents you from applying a more moisturizing base on\nyour contours and a base that you therefore of the T zone today I keep it simple I'm going to apply the\nbase everywhere to see how how the make-up reacts on this base that's of course not me\nthis basic style I'm not going to apply it too close to my dark circles because otherwise\nI'm going to leave my under eyes which are still mostly this one and still quite marked\nI'm not going no more correction on my dark circles by applying a\npeach apricot corrector to remove the gray areas I will directly test my new concealer from\nMaybelline weather anti-aging a few years ago I tested one like this but that\nwas not anti-aging so I started a little before the little pump so as not to waste time\nso I don't know if it is better to apply it with a brush if it is better to\napply it with your finger use the small tip here I have it plic\u00e9 the color\nit's the color 0.2 I think it's a little bit yellow but but hey here's what I'm\ngoing to apply it I think on the finger it's not bad here we go let's go on the finger we will see\nthe coverage is beautiful and good but for example\nmy gray dark circles under me I find that it always shows a little bit\nit spreads well\nso on this side I have the impression that it marks a little bit more deserves my machine a\nbig one here and there and I find that it marks a little more on that side it's not bad at all\nit's not particularly luminous but it's not particularly matte either it dries gently\nI'm going apply my foundation and I'll get back to you I applied my foundation it's been\na few minutes I left a little time for the concealer the foundation to\nblend in well it's really it is not bad for dark circles it's a little lighter than my\ncomplexion but not too much I really like this side of my dark circles rather than that it goes I have\nto find the right way to apply this this this this this concealer I have other things\nto discover I don't powder my complexion anymore anyway I have no powder to discover\nthis month and I'm going to bring a little light right away with my new bronzer\na luminous hours bronze the bronzing skin from the brand Nabla it's not a brand you\n're used to seeing on my on my channel here it is bronzer bronzer in amber and\nluminous color you know that I love luminous complexion products my complexion is not particularly\ngloomy but I have good hopes by applying my new products so I have to come and\ntake it, let's go go slowly anyway\nit applies really very slowly and I come to apply my Brodeur\nso I wonder if this brush is very very suitable\nit takes but then it takes wow it's not easy to pick up the\ncolor I think it was ok very very funny but no I'm still going\nto try with another brush we complexion brush yeah it is much better\nand we see better it marks immediately a little more then for a luminous bronzer\nin any case it blurs very very bi there's no denying it handles quite\nwell but I still have a doubt about the luminous thing\ngood it spreads well the pigmentation is good but you have to choose your brush carefully\nmy brush that I have the habit of using and well it is it must be too fluffy to\ncome and recover the materials well it brings you a slight light but frankly\nbut it is not worth the Park Avenue princess at tarte en bronze hours luminous\nor so the i had tested another one too that I loved the White and white\nit still gives you a light yes but then very very very very\napplied I redefined my face a little bit review for the moment of\nthis Nabla bronzer in amber color in arm in arm\nand there is a small mirror in the\nand there on the other hand yes yes there is there is light\nI really like this tone a little cold a little by\nit is very pretty on a complexion a little a little a little golden\nthe light comes out well I'm going to rub my brush to remove a\nlittle bit the surplus of products almost straight become clean color and I\n'm going to come and take the darkest color frankly the color\nit gives you or it's pretty that the mixture of the two hazelnuts\nhow pretty is that brings back a little cold and the light and the\nlight I dare not even tell you I'm going to put a little bit there\nit's too too pretty the pigmentation and there the two headlights I think we can mix them\nand here are the using at the same time but you can clearly see the lighter and the darker I have\nit does not mark the small the small imperfections of the skin no it's pretty\nI like it a lot here is the blush the double blush from l' cosmetic age I like I'm going to go do\nmy eyes and I'll meet you for the application of mascara and lipstick here I finished\nmy eyes I applied my eyebrow pencil from Nyx cosmetics I applied at the end well the two blushes a little mixed on my eyelids my\neyelid crease and my\nshave here I did it with the bronzer from Nabla in color in strands a little pencil on the\nlower mucosa and a small line of eyeliner with the epic the epic link liner from Nyx here I\nwanted to do a make-up -up quite light at eye level since today I'm going to test\nmy new mascara with you my mascara from Beauty the perfect perfect what the perfect really\nall threads it's the volume mascara from Beauty in travel size despite\nthat either a travel size I think we have it in hand here we go I'm going to apply it\nhere it's still in the packaging is very very good I like it and I'm going to apply my mascara\nand there I just make a stain stain\nthere is no package\nthe brush is fine the wires\na little volume\nI apply a second coat on the other side a second coat a coat on\nthe other side it's not bad one layer is already not bad we will see the second layer\nI will let my pops dry my two traces that I did know r my eyelids\nof course there's a truck passing by and takes its time\nit's going to make noise\na small package\nit's not bad at all indeed it will give you volume in the second\nlayer not particularly long and the trend I\nwould tell you maybe- being a little bit bulky\nit was a bit bulky\nso is it because it's new we're going to try to work a bit like that\nI don't really like the two sizes I made on my eyelids good\nI find it quite quite liquid but hey it's new so here\nit is I applied two coats on each side I'm going to let my small traces of\nvolume mascara dry yes be careful for now I'll tell you that it's new so I have to wait until\nI wear it a little bit more it's time to fan myself a little bit\nto dry it I find it quite liquid and there you have it, the disaster has taken place but the result is\nquite nice watch out for the package in any case the first days I will come back to you of course\nfor the e assessment and tell you what I think but for the moment it's not bad it's volume there is\nno length it's not sold for length we agree but that's you makes\nvery pretty eyelashes it works well I think that between the first and the second coat it may\nbe necessary to count a little bit a few extra seconds compared to what I did\nfor it to hang well since for the right now it's a little runny here I'm going to go to\nlipstick as I told you I made an order at Beauty Bay I took a\ndaily bread three nude colors there I'm going to test a first color that looks good call on the\nbox it's not marked and there it's written in very small it's the anyway the lipstick creams\nit's a nude color here's the color I'm going I'm going to buy it for you it's grapes so at the\nheld level I'm not going to sell you this for a long hold but in any case on the hand it's\nquite pretty it's a bit of a rosewood a p little brown with a gentleman who is\na little alike in the reeds I think it will be fine I apply my lipstick\nit happens well the color of my lips\nthere is no need to put 150 tons the pigmentation and it covers your lips right away\nreally not badly I would like there to be a little a little smell on the lipstick\nbut not unpleasant I think that here it goes well with for example the color of my\neyeshadows it is a nude a little pink a little maroon it's not bad I like it a lot anyway it's\ncomfortable it's shiny but not too much it's not bad here it's grapes it's grapes\ncream that applies well I really like the result here I have finished my make-up\nassessment of the one I used the base from mafactor the miracle prep yes it prepared me well\nto apply my my make-up them products slipped on it really well we felt\na certain comfort when applying the products now is she ok? erate my T zone\nwell I'll come back to you in any case it's a very pleasant product to use for the moment\nthe concealer the concealer well listen I'm I'm quite amazed with the result I can't\ntell you I went there to say yeah a new one I'm going to be happy with it the hair everywhere I\nthink that on this side it's really very pretty so you know that I'm super picky but\nI think the result is very pretty even if the coverage is light to medium you can still see\na little bit of gray but with a color correction right there apply that on top I'm\nsure it must be very pretty it doesn't mark the fine lines on this side I have some ribules\nwhich are much more marked I really have two pandas it does not mark them more it is not\nblurred on that I agree but in any case it does not mark them more and\nand the product is comfortable I I don't have tightness I don't feel like\nit's screaming on my under my eye it's it's quite nice the result is not very bright but\nI would say that the result is natural here so he goes really well\nwe will see over time the tan the skin bronzing from Nabla in color in arms there\nthe advantage is that it is really written big and what comfort then me I have it I took it\nfor something bright a little disappointed on the on the bright it's very very light but\nanyway good here it is not super bright here good at the level of the application choose well\nyour your brush a brush that's too fluffy well, it's going to have a hard time picking up the material but otherwise\nhere I used this brush if from it it applied very well it coats well it\nfeels good on the skin there's no d thickness very good very good a little disappointed with the light but\ngood here is fortunately that at LH cosmetics it offered us two luminous blush so\nthe color I can't tell you I don't see it if it's if but then it's written microscopic it\nscrolls as usual very very nice surprise that it melts into the skin pigmentation and there no\nneed to highlight everything is in this little one in this little box with a mirror I\nreally like I really like the result the fact that it's cold in color and well why not with\na bronze hours a little a little golden a little golden and Well and well it balances it out and so on the\neyelids it's applied super well that that's done that's done the mascara then the mascara\nwell well it's new it's quite liquid it had made me two small stains that I\nremoved that it is very well removed moreover with a small a small brush like that\nI can not tell you that it makes the length of the volume very probably\nI like it the result in any case the rendering of the mascara is very pretty I\nwill not tell you that it looks natural but I like to have in use if it removes make-up\nwell if it does not even have eyelashes throughout the weeks here is the red lipstick and\nlisten to this color it's really pretty it's very comfortable it fits plique\nhere is a diaper boom boom boom it's done I really like the rendering it's bright but\nnot too much it's comfortable there is a little smell a little taste but that does not persist\nhere anyway I hope that you will have had a good time in my company if so\ndon't forget the little blue thumbs up it's more fun if it's not\ndone yet don't wait subscribe it's free it's a

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on.

is my virtual assistant I do have someone\u00a0\nhelp me so thank you so much Emily for helping\u00a0\u00a0\nme out because this was truly truly needed so I\u00a0\nam going to go through and do a full face and of\u00a0\u00a0\ncourse I'm going to be trying these things out\u00a0\na little bit more first impression is all fine\u00a0\u00a0\nand dandy but I always come back and give you my\u00a0\nfinal thoughts later on what we're gonna start\u00a0\u00a0\nwith is the essence hello good stuff glow serum\u00a0\nprimer this is a hydrating and smooth base with\u00a0\u00a0\nwatermelon water and niacinamide and from previous\u00a0\nexperiences my skin loves both watermelon and\u00a0\u00a0\nniacinamide and this was the favorite of both\u00a0\nKelly Gooch and Steph's Beauty stash and Steph\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't exactly know what Kelly Gucci's skin\u00a0\ntype is actually I've never tried this like\u00a0\u00a0\nI said these are First Impressions but I do know\u00a0\nthat Steph's Beauty stash lives in Texas we are in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe same climate we are around the same age this\u00a0\nis what it looks like we are in our late 30s I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink we're around the same age and she has oily\u00a0\nskin and I have combo skin not 100 sure what this\u00a0\u00a0\nsmells watermelony what kind of skin type Telly\u00a0\nhas but Kelly and I usually like similar stuff\u00a0\u00a0\neven though we don't have similar uh type of make\u00a0\na preferences if that makes sense she likes more\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know the clean makeup Aesthetics there but\u00a0\nnot their makeup and I like my makeup to be seen\u00a0\u00a0\nI want bright colorful dramatic scene makeup I\u00a0\ndo have a little bit of a breakout on my chin\u00a0\u00a0\nthat might be from me trying that Nivea\u00a0\nbomb I'm not saying that that is what\u00a0\u00a0\nit is but it could be so I'm just gonna\u00a0\nuse this is the I am magic Foundation by\u00a0\u00a0\num dubious place and I use this Foundation\u00a0\nas a um spot concealer because it is\u00a0\u00a0\nfully opaque and it is matte and it dries down\u00a0\non itself so if you're looking for a like a cover\u00a0\u00a0\nconcealer try this Foundation because honestly\u00a0\nit is the best spot concealer I've ever had and\u00a0\u00a0\nit is a foundation and it is a lot of product it's\u00a0\ngoing to last you for forever okay let me wash my\u00a0\u00a0\nhands and let's go in with this Foundation that\u00a0\nI spent the entire of 2022 regretting not trying\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is my moment because this is the Nars light\u00a0\nreflecting Foundation I got mine in medium one\u00a0\u00a0\nPunjab that's the one I got I don't remember why\u00a0\nI didn't try this out when it came out I tried a\u00a0\u00a0\nbunch of other ones I tried the makeup forever\u00a0\nFoundation that came out last year absolutely\u00a0\u00a0\nloved it I tried the Charlotte Tilbury beautiful\u00a0\nskin Foundation that came out around the same time\u00a0\u00a0\nas this one and I really like that one too but for\u00a0\none reason or another I didn't try this one and I\u00a0\u00a0\nregretted it throughout the entire year because\u00a0\nso many people love this one this was mentioned\u00a0\u00a0\nas a favorite from too much mouth makeup Molly\u00a0\nAlicia Archer formerly known as kinky sweat and\u00a0\u00a0\nmandelia and I did talk to my friend Ali glines\u00a0\nthe other day and she also said that she loves\u00a0\u00a0\nthis and she also like me lives in a humid climate\u00a0\nand she is in her 30s and she has oily skin so I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nfeeling that there is a lot of different people\u00a0\nwith different skin types and different ages and\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent living in different climates that really\u00a0\nlove this foundation and look at that shade match\u00a0\u00a0\nthat is a great change match I will say though\u00a0\nthat I did I did match myself in store so I\u00a0\u00a0\nwould have been a little disappointed if I had\u00a0\npicked out something that was totally off because\u00a0\u00a0\nI mean I picked this in the store this is more\u00a0\nliquidy than I thought it was going to be but if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou have been here before if this isn't your\u00a0\nfirst rodeo on the Angelica Nicholas Channel\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know that I really like a medium coverage\u00a0\nnatural finish Foundation that is a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nmore liquidy inconsistency there are a couple of\u00a0\nmore thicker foundations there are a couple of\u00a0\u00a0\nlike full coverage foundations or light coverage\u00a0\nfoundations that I love but those are my soft\u00a0\u00a0\nspots if I have a serum like or liquidy foundation\u00a0\nwith a medium coverage and a natural finish I\u00a0\u00a0\nusually tend to pick them up this one is described\u00a0\nas like a light reflectant and that's probably the\u00a0\u00a0\nreason why I didn't buy it see your light and it's\u00a0\nbest light light reflecting Foundation instantly\u00a0\u00a0\ndiffuses light to blur imperfections and smooth\u00a0\nthe look of skin visibly improves Skin's clarity\u00a0\u00a0\nhuh buildable coverage natural finish why didn't\u00a0\nI buy this I think it's the light reflecting that\u00a0\u00a0\nmade me think that like oh it's going to be\u00a0\na dewy Foundation but look at this liquidy\u00a0\u00a0\nit's so liquidy I'm so impressed I'd like to\u00a0\nformally apologize for not loving you sooner\nmy bad I actually have a bunch of cream products\u00a0\nto go through so we are going to end with powder\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I have the Lys triple fix full coverage\u00a0\nbrightening concealer this is the favorite\u00a0\u00a0\nof my friend uh Samantha March but it is also the\u00a0\nfavorite of Alicia Archer formerly known as kinky\u00a0\u00a0\nSuave and I feel like me and Samantha Martin have\u00a0\na similar issues when it comes to our under eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one I also picked up in store so this should\u00a0\nbe a good shade and that is that we have a lot of\u00a0\u00a0\nfine lines under our eyes me and Samantha are\u00a0\nboth in our I don't know if she's in her late\u00a0\u00a0\n30s she might be in her mid-30s I mean I have\u00a0\nmet Samantha in real life and I do think that\u00a0\u00a0\nI have more Fine Lines than her which makes sense\u00a0\nwhat is this where do I get those Crunchies from\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I think I'm like like somewhere between\u00a0\nthree and five years older than her so I think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat that makes sense but I'm interested to\u00a0\nsee this is a very like light Foundation I\u00a0\u00a0\nwill say this one makes me feel like I'm gonna\u00a0\nbreak it when I stuff it down because like\u00a0\u00a0\nyou have to use some power I don't know if I love\u00a0\nthe packaging because of how flimsy that wand felt\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen I had to push it down to the packaging\u00a0\nbut I like how light this felt I feel like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe consistency of this concealer is very similar\u00a0\nto the consistency of the Maybelline um what is\u00a0\u00a0\nit called that concealer I will pop up a picture\u00a0\nhere of the concealer you know the one that I love\u00a0\u00a0\nso much I think it's an amazing concealer at the\u00a0\ndrugstore it's a consistency of this one and how\u00a0\u00a0\nit Blends out reminds me a lot of that one and\u00a0\nfor that reason I think I'm gonna love this one\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is the product this and the Nars Foundation\u00a0\nare the two products that I was fairly certain\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I was gonna like because of who liked them\u00a0\nand for what reasons they like them that looks\u00a0\u00a0\nhonestly stunning I think I'm gonna like this\u00a0\none but if you're looking for something similar\u00a0\u00a0\nto this but at a lower cost I would recommend you\u00a0\nto check out that Maybelline One I will link that\u00a0\u00a0\ndown below as well in case you are interested like\u00a0\nI said we'll try the powder at the end because I\u00a0\u00a0\nhave a bunch of cream products that I want to try\u00a0\nwith you and I did buy two things from M cosmetics\u00a0\u00a0\nand this is recommendations from Judy Judy has\u00a0\nan amazing YouTube channel and she also has an\u00a0\u00a0\namazing Instagram please check it out on Instagram\u00a0\nshe's so good at Instagram so this is the So Soft\u00a0\u00a0\nmulti-face plate bronze and sculpt uh little like\u00a0\nbronzer stick and I actually mentioned a product\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom um cosmetics in my yearly favorites which\u00a0\nwas one of their powder blushes so when I saw\u00a0\u00a0\nthat Judy had two of the M Cosmetics products on\u00a0\nher favorites list I was like you know what let me\u00a0\u00a0\ntry these out because I really really really like\u00a0\nthat blush so this is a cream bronzer in summer\nit looks like it's gonna work for\u00a0\nme right I'm intrigued to see how\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is going to work out and this is\u00a0\nthe Sunscape highlighter in clarity\nyou know what this reminds me of this reminds\u00a0\nme of the baked highlighters that came out in\u00a0\u00a0\nlike 2015-16 that people went crazy for who\u00a0\nremembers the dose of colors highlighters\u00a0\u00a0\nI remember Pepperidge Farm members okay\u00a0\nlet me start with this one and I like\u00a0\u00a0\ndoing bronzer up here and taking it down a\u00a0\nlittle bit because I want this part to like\u00a0\u00a0\nsink in a little bit because that fits my face\u00a0\nshape remember to do like bronzer and contour\u00a0\u00a0\nand all of that remember to do it in a way\u00a0\nthat fits you your style your face shape I\u00a0\u00a0\ndo a little bronzer here I never Contour my\u00a0\nforehead though because have the smallest\u00a0\u00a0\nforehead in the world but we'll do a little\u00a0\nbit like this and we'll see how this works out\u00a0\u00a0\nbut we'll do a little bit like this I'm\u00a0\njust gonna I like a flimsy brush for\u00a0\u00a0\ncream bronzer I feel like it Blends in the best\u00a0\nespecially if I haven't set it with powder yet\nthat looks Flawless and what a good shade for\u00a0\nme I like a bronzer that's a little warm but I\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it to be on the golden side and not on the\u00a0\nTerracotta Red side because I have a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nmore of a golden undertone I do not have peach or\u00a0\nred undertone so that is looking super beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm really liking how that is looking before I\u00a0\ngo in with that highlighter we are going to do a\u00a0\u00a0\nblush first and this is the color fluid in the\u00a0\nmatte color orange that is from hindash I was\u00a0\u00a0\nso close to buying these but they took a really\u00a0\nlong time to come to beautylish this is the color\u00a0\u00a0\nRising which is an orange nobody's surprise and\u00a0\nthis was a favorite of both khaki and Theresa is\u00a0\u00a0\ndead and I am very intrigued to be trying this out\u00a0\nI do think that both of those have dry skin though\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich I do not have but I did try this uh fluid\u00a0\nin this shimmery color and the formula is blue\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful like really beautiful color so let's\u00a0\nI don't know what I'm doing let's try this out\nthat's really pigmented I don't like having\u00a0\nblush I don't like having blush all over my\u00a0\u00a0\ncheeks I don't like blush down here and\u00a0\nI don't like using big brushes for blush\u00a0\u00a0\nso I like being a little bit more precise\u00a0\nwith my blush placement and I don't like\u00a0\u00a0\nputting it down here because I feel like it\u00a0\nages me uh but this is very very pigmented\nmistakes have been made okay I'm gonna\u00a0\nput a little bit of foundation on top\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is a very good trick if you like me\u00a0\nyou went a little overboard with the blush\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can always put a light layer of the foundation\u00a0\non top and just blend it together and it will take\u00a0\u00a0\nit down just a little bit I feel like I ended up\u00a0\nin a good space with this it's looking orange and\u00a0\u00a0\nflushed but that's like too too much I don't know\u00a0\nif I'm gonna like this okay I don't know if I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna like this but I was intrigued because\u00a0\nthis is the Airbrush Airbrush brightening\u00a0\u00a0\nFlawless finish powder by Charlotte Tilbury\u00a0\nand this was in the favorites of this is so\u00a0\u00a0\nwhite oh this isn't the favorites of Teresa's Den\u00a0\nTeresa is fair I like I told you the foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nshade I'm using right now is in the medium one\u00a0\nI would describe myself as a light medium even\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen I don't have a sliver of tan on me I am\u00a0\nnever fair so I don't know what possessed me\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know what persets me to try this one\u00a0\nbut here we are uh but she said that this was\u00a0\u00a0\num just brightening under the eyes and I have\u00a0\nbeen using and really enjoying let me show you\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one from Covergirl this is the advanced\u00a0\nRadiance and this is also super super light but\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is white so I thought that maybe I'd like\u00a0\nthese similarly they were just like brightening\u00a0\u00a0\nbut still like transparent translucent under\u00a0\nthe eyes and we will see let's try it out on\u00a0\u00a0\nthis side I'm gonna use I like using powder\u00a0\nhere down in my smile lines and under my eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nand where I get a little oily and I like being\u00a0\nlight in the inner part of my face because I\u00a0\u00a0\nhave a pretty small face and I also have pretty\u00a0\nwhite like I like being like I does this make\u00a0\u00a0\nsense I don't know I like being light in the\u00a0\nmiddle of my face I call it a spotlight effect\u00a0\u00a0\nI think that that fits my face shape and that's\u00a0\nwhy I still do the triangle with the concealer\u00a0\u00a0\njust with less concealer because I think that\u00a0\nthat fits me I'm just doing it on half my face\nokay so it's definitely brightening but it's not\u00a0\na flat powder which is nice I mean you can still\u00a0\u00a0\nsee that there's a little bit of the glow from the\u00a0\nfoundation coming through like it's not entirely\u00a0\u00a0\nflat okay we're gonna see how this one holds\u00a0\nup and if it stops my concealer from creasing\u00a0\u00a0\nand since this is a powder that is loved by\u00a0\nsomeone with dry skin I'm also expecting that\u00a0\u00a0\nit's going to work with for someone like me\u00a0\nthat is has a little bit more you know going\u00a0\u00a0\ninto the mature skin peeps okay so I did some\u00a0\nof my brows but I am gonna use the Nyx Thicket\u00a0\u00a0\nstick it brow mascara and this was the favorite\u00a0\nof Andrea metaliano and Barry bean I also will\u00a0\u00a0\nsay the powder this powder reminds me a lot in\u00a0\nconsistency not inconsistency but how it looks\u00a0\u00a0\non the skin of the under eye setting powder by\u00a0\nPat McGrath because it has you can see here it\u00a0\u00a0\nhas a little bit of a Sheen it's not a million\u00a0\npercent matte so for that reason it looks great\u00a0\u00a0\nunder the eyes but it doesn't look great here\u00a0\nwhat I really want to be matte so it's good\u00a0\u00a0\nfor me to know that there's an alternative to\u00a0\nthe Pathmark I really butcher this one to the\u00a0\u00a0\nPat McGrath powder and that it is very similar to\u00a0\nthat one but it didn't become you know the Papago\u00a0\u00a0\npowder it picks up in the pan it becomes super\u00a0\nsuper powdery this one didn't do that but on the\u00a0\u00a0\nhonestly they look very similar not\u00a0\n100 matte why is this Orange Auburn\nI mean that's good that's good\u00a0\nwhy am I why am I worried I have\u00a0\u00a0\norange hair why am I worried why am I\u00a0\nworried okay apparently I got Auburn\ndo you see all the hair sticking out am I\u00a0\nsupposed to like take some off am I what\u00a0\u00a0\nam I doing famous last words okay um I like\u00a0\nto push my brows a little bit more upwards\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I have really long brow hairs so\u00a0\nthis is my way of making my brows look a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle thicker because if my brow hairs\u00a0\nweren't just laying down all sad my brows\u00a0\u00a0\nwould be thicker because I have really long\u00a0\nbrow hairs they just don't want to stick up\nI'm afraid I'm gonna get it\u00a0\non my skin which I did here\nI will say it does really\u00a0\nmake my brow hair stick up\nthe the question is like I said my brow\u00a0\nhairs really want to oh no I got a blob blob\u00a0\u00a0\nmy brow hairs really want to lay down so\u00a0\nthe question is is it gonna keep it up all\u00a0\u00a0\nday like both the Nyx one and the Patrick\u00a0\ntall one does but I do prefer the Patrick\u00a0\u00a0\ntall one but the next one works too or is it\u00a0\ngoing to fall down like all sad that that blob\u00a0\u00a0\nit was a little hard to use the colored one when\u00a0\nyou have like fine long hairs like me and you\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't want to have it like all over your skin but\u00a0\nmaybe if I like hmm we'll see I'm gonna of course\u00a0\u00a0\nlet you know in the future how I feel about these\u00a0\nproducts if I like have anything to say about them\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I will say most of the time how I feel about\u00a0\nproducts after the first time I use them it rarely\u00a0\u00a0\nchanges sometimes with Foundation it changes\u00a0\nthough because like you use them with different\u00a0\u00a0\nprimers and you use them with different powders\u00a0\nand you use them in different circumstances and\u00a0\u00a0\nlike all of that I do get it on my skin like you\u00a0\ncan probably tell let me see if I can get some off\u00a0\u00a0\nwith this old Q-tip that I found don't judge me\u00a0\nwhat I like this more if it didn't have a color\u00a0\u00a0\nto it or is it just that I need to practice more\u00a0\nbecause I think that this looks good and it did\u00a0\u00a0\ngive a little bit of warmth to my brows that I\u00a0\nactually enjoy okay okay it's a little bit harder\u00a0\u00a0\nto use because it's colored and I'm Cuts I have\u00a0\ntwo lip products that I want to use this lip liner\u00a0\u00a0\nwas actually mentioned as a favorite of tati and\u00a0\nshe mentioned this one from Covergirl this is the\u00a0\u00a0\nsimply ageless lip flip liner I got 150 elegant\u00a0\nnude and I thought it was going to be more of\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a mauve but I think it's or is it just maybe\u00a0\nit is this color I just feel like it looked more\u00a0\u00a0\npink when I got out of the packaging this looks\u00a0\nexactly like that lip liner that Patrick tall\u00a0\u00a0\nreleased that was like one of those lip liners\u00a0\nthat you could both use a line and then fill it in\nthat's a really nice formula creamy but not\u00a0\ngreasy because I don't like green some lip\u00a0\u00a0\nlines are just too creamy and it makes them look\u00a0\nuneven and I don't like that creamy is good but\u00a0\u00a0\nsometimes they're just too smeary this one does\u00a0\nsmell like lipstick you know the classic lipstick\u00a0\u00a0\nscent if you know you know I'm Gonna Fill my lips\u00a0\nin I mean for me this is a pink this isn't a nude\u00a0\u00a0\nat all in on anyone well maybe if you have like\u00a0\nmedium medium skin tone with a very pink undertone\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe this is a nude on you but on me this is a\u00a0\npink but I'm gonna put a lip gloss on top or like\u00a0\u00a0\na lip oil because this is the Milani fruit fetish\u00a0\nlip balm I got mine in pineapple papaya and this\u00a0\u00a0\nis a favorite of both and Ray metalliano and Kelly\u00a0\nGooch and both of them love a lot of drugstore\u00a0\u00a0\nstill have the sticker on like I said I haven't\u00a0\ntried any of these some of these I haven't even\u00a0\u00a0\nlike looked at the color or smelled them oh that\u00a0\nsmells nice and I think this is it is a little\u00a0\u00a0\norangey but it's supposed to be like a sheer\u00a0\nwith a little orange tint oh that is very light\u00a0\u00a0\nso it says lip balm but it is definitely super\u00a0\nlight more like a lip oil if I'm gonna be honest\u00a0\u00a0\nit feels like a lip oil so I would say be\u00a0\na little bit careful when you're squeezing\u00a0\u00a0\nout of this one because you might end up getting\u00a0\ntoo much because it is very liquidy like an oil\u00a0\u00a0\ntastes a little bit sweet I'm not I'm not mad\u00a0\nabout that should we put some of this highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\non then the one from M Cosmetics it looks really\u00a0\nreally pretty and I'm excited to see how this one\u00a0\u00a0\ngoes on now that we have finished our face oh\u00a0\nthat is pretty it is a little like I can see a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle Sparkle it's not glittery but it's not one\u00a0\nof those that just looks wet I can definitely see\u00a0\u00a0\na little Sparkle if you're looking for something\u00a0\nthat just looks wet I really like those new ones\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom Charlotte Tilbury like I really like that\u00a0\none and there I say I like it more than I like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe one from rare Beauty I don't know if you're\u00a0\nallowed to say that because I feel like I'm the\u00a0\u00a0\nonly one who feels that way but that's how I\u00a0\nfeel but this is really pretty but definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen you work it in gives a little bit of a\u00a0\nwet effect I just want to get close I can't\u00a0\u00a0\nsee some of the particles but it's definitely not\u00a0\nglittery and I like to put some here because like\u00a0\u00a0\nI told you before I don't have a forehead and I\u00a0\nwant it to appear um a little longer than it is\nthat looks really nice I will say I have a lot\u00a0\nof highlighters in my collection that I prefer\u00a0\u00a0\nover this one but I definitely don't think that\u00a0\nthis is a bad highlighter by any stretch of the\u00a0\u00a0\nimagination last and final thing this is something\u00a0\nthat I actually have had in my collection for a\u00a0\u00a0\nbit and I for some weird reason thought that\u00a0\nthis came out in 2021 which now that I look\u00a0\u00a0\nback at it confuses me because it did come out\u00a0\nin 2022 and this is the fantasy cosmetica Druid\u00a0\u00a0\npalette I don't know why I didn't think that\u00a0\nthis came out in 2020 I I don't know why this\u00a0\u00a0\nwas mentioned as a favorite both by Betty Jean and\u00a0\nAmanda from makeup just for fun and we have very\u00a0\u00a0\nsimilar taste when it comes to eyeshadows and\u00a0\nI have tried the other two palettes that came\u00a0\u00a0\nout from fantasy cosmetica after this one and\u00a0\nI do have a cold with fantasy cosmetica my code\u00a0\u00a0\nisn't Jessica but for some reason this one I have\u00a0\nonly swatched but I've never used it on my eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nbut we're changing that today like I said I\u00a0\nhave swatched this palette and I don't know\u00a0\u00a0\nif you can see yeah you can see there these\u00a0\nare duochromes or like this one you can see\u00a0\u00a0\nit's like a plum to a green and here you also\u00a0\nhave like a purple to this like muted green and\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is like almost like a tealy mint to like\u00a0\na purple and I'm not 100 sure what I want to do\u00a0\u00a0\ndo I want to do something green because I am\u00a0\nwearing a green shirt or do I want to mix it up\u00a0\u00a0\nor do I want to do you know what maybe I'll use\u00a0\nall of these mats these three mats okay this is\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat I'm doing I'm gonna start with this green\u00a0\none it's in the corner the darker one and we'll\u00a0\u00a0\nput that out here you know what I am excited to\u00a0\nbe trying this out I do know from before with\u00a0\u00a0\num this brand that the shimmers are amazing\u00a0\nand the mattes are good too but not as good as\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Shimmers so I like to start with the darkest\u00a0\ncolor to get that to be as dark as I want it to be\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I like to see colors being true\u00a0\nto pan on the eyes I think I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nkeep it like that and I'm just gonna blend\u00a0\nthis upwards a little bit to lift the eye\u00a0\u00a0\nlike that and then I'm gonna use the\u00a0\nlighter green and the inner part of the\u00a0\u00a0\ncrease and I'll blend this out a little bit\u00a0\nand we can use that plummy one on the lower\u00a0\u00a0\nlash line okay so this is the lighter\u00a0\nGreen Oh you know I love a like warm\u00a0\u00a0\nlike swamp green like this that is so beautiful\u00a0\nagain I'm just packing this on and now I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nblend them together a little bit I'm just blending\u00a0\non top here it looks a little muddy out here\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I said this this matte formula it's good but\u00a0\nit's not my absolute favorite but I definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nthink that it's looking okay maybe a little bit\u00a0\nmore dramatic than I had in mind but that's like\nthat's all of my that's all of my work\u00a0\nlet's be honest okay let me use this one\u00a0\u00a0\nit's called Old growth this one and\u00a0\nI'm just gonna do that under my eyes\nI just wanted to try as many shades as possible\u00a0\nI think that people fall in love with Palace for\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent reasons a lot of people fall in love\u00a0\nwith Palace because of their amazing shimmers\u00a0\u00a0\nme personally I usually fall in love with Palace\u00a0\nbecause of their amazing matte formula because I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink it's harder to do good maths than to do good\u00a0\nshimmers so I'm really excited to be digging into\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shimmers because I do think that those are\u00a0\ngoing to be the star of the show I kind of want to\u00a0\u00a0\ndo this one on the top lid and we'll do a little\u00a0\nbit of this one maybe just on the lower lash line\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm just trying stuff out and I'm gonna spray it\u00a0\nbecause I do want it to look as opaque as possible\u00a0\u00a0\nand I also want to make sure to get this little\u00a0\nFallout as possible this is a little bit more\u00a0\u00a0\nof a Topper shade and I love the topper shade\u00a0\nbecause I feel like it's so flattering on a lid\u00a0\u00a0\nthat has some more folds and creases and I really\u00a0\nlove the matte shadows to peek through underneath\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is really pretty I also think\u00a0\nthat it's so easy to blend out the\u00a0\u00a0\nedges between a Topper shade and a matte oh\u00a0\nyou can see the shift here the blue purple\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is the transformation shade that I'm\u00a0\ngonna put a little bit on the lower lash line\nit has more of a plummy base and it works so\u00a0\ngood together with the lower lash line shade\u00a0\u00a0\ngot a little bit of bit of sparkly fall\u00a0\noff but overall I do think the eye look\u00a0\u00a0\nlooks really good but I can tell that\u00a0\nthere's a little low patchiness going on\u00a0\u00a0\nover here let me see if I can fix that and I\u00a0\nalso need to fix some kind of an inner corner\u00a0\u00a0\nI like a mat in a corner so let me finish this up\u00a0\nand we can chat about these yearly favorites from\u00a0\u00a0\npeople and whether or not I agree I'm actually\u00a0\ngoing to use one of these Shadows actually from\u00a0\u00a0\nOceanside one of the multi-chromes in my inner\u00a0\nCorner because this one is like a little like a\u00a0\u00a0\ngreeny teal and I think it's gonna fit I usually\u00a0\ndo a matte inner corner but I'm still that is a\u00a0\u00a0\ncat hair I'm still in the process of reviewing\u00a0\nall of these and I thought this would be a good\u00a0\u00a0\nchance to use this one in my inner Corners yeah\u00a0\nI think that this one is going to be perfect\u00a0\u00a0\njust adding a little bit of something lighter that\u00a0\nis very very bright almost too much huh okay can\u00a0\u00a0\nyou also can we appreciate the shift like do you\u00a0\nsee that shift also my skin is looking flawless\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's a little bit of muddiness and patchiness\u00a0\nhere but I do think with this palette the star\u00a0\u00a0\nof the show really is like the shimmers but yeah\u00a0\nlet me finish this up and we can have that chat\u00a0\u00a0\nam I having a good hair day or what I I'm having\u00a0\na really good hair day I will say I feel like this\u00a0\u00a0\npowder is probably better under my eyes than like\u00a0\naround my nose so I'm gonna use a little bit of\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one that is a little bit more matte and I'm\u00a0\njust gonna use that here because I prefer and you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan see the difference I prefer being matte here\u00a0\nso it doesn't reflect like the crevices and stuff\u00a0\u00a0\nyou get with time so just adding a little bit of\u00a0\nMadness and I think that that looks even better\u00a0\u00a0\nbut that's just a personal preference my favorites\u00a0\nare the two favorites that I thought was going to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe my favorite and that is the foundation and the\u00a0\nconcealer I think they are flawless I also really\u00a0\u00a0\nreally like the bronzer stick by m Cosmetics I\u00a0\nthink that one looks incredible I will say I am\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit surprised at how pigmented this blush\u00a0\nis the pigmentation reminds me a little bit of the\u00a0\u00a0\num rare Beauty liquid blush if you know you know\u00a0\nyou really do need this smallest amount I want\u00a0\u00a0\nto use this on my lips as well because this is\u00a0\nan all over you can use it on your eyes too but\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely less is more with this one I really do\u00a0\nlike this powder but this is going to be an under\u00a0\u00a0\neye powder for me for sure this one I really do\u00a0\nthink I'm gonna get good use out of this my skin\u00a0\u00a0\ndoes feel really nice it didn't give any glitter\u00a0\nor anything like that which is like sometimes with\u00a0\u00a0\nthese Illuminating primers sometimes they are\u00a0\nglittery and sometimes they're greasy and this\u00a0\u00a0\nwas neither plus it has two ingredients that my\u00a0\nskin likes so it's going to be interesting to\u00a0\u00a0\ntry that more the lip products neither of them\u00a0\nare favorites for me I am surprised I prefer\u00a0\u00a0\nif it's gonna be like a lip oil I prefer it\u00a0\nto be in a packaging that's not going to be\u00a0\u00a0\nas hard this is a really weird packaging for\u00a0\nsomething that is that liquidy and that oily\u00a0\u00a0\nI mean it looks nice it feels nice but I do think\u00a0\nthat I have other I just this packaging just\u00a0\u00a0\nthrows me off a little bit with the consistency\u00a0\nand I will say with the eyeshadow palette I mean\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shimmers are incredible but I am surprised\u00a0\nthat this is a favorite because it is a good\u00a0\u00a0\npalette but like I know what's out there and even\u00a0\nthough I have tried this one now and I ranked all\u00a0\u00a0\nmy palettes that I tried last year I have a full\u00a0\nvideo ranking all of the palettes that I tried to\u00a0\u00a0\nreview during 2022. if you want to check it out\u00a0\nit is on my channel you can just sort my videos\u00a0\u00a0\nthrough most popular videos because it recently\u00a0\nreached 100K views so it has a lot of views I\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't think that this would have made top 10 for\u00a0\nme it's a nice palette I like it and I like I\u00a0\u00a0\nlike the color story I like the theming I like the\u00a0\nshimmers the mattes are not my favorite though and\u00a0\u00a0\ntake this with take this with the perspective of\u00a0\nsomeone that falls in love with my matte shadows\u00a0\u00a0\nI pay so much more attention to matte shadows than\u00a0\nI do too Shimmer Shadows because it is harder to\u00a0\u00a0\nformulate a Matte Shadow than it is to formulate\u00a0\na shimmer Shadow especially when it comes to matte\u00a0\u00a0\nshadows that are not well bronze we're going to\u00a0\nbe honest it is easier to to formulate something\u00a0\u00a0\nthat is close to someone's skin tone these\u00a0\nare not bad mats but they're not my favorite\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're not my favorite but I like the look\u00a0\nI think it's really pretty but I don't think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat this would have been my favorite palette of\u00a0\nthe Year even though I think it is a nice palette\u00a0\u00a0\nand especially the shimmers so my favorite are\u00a0\nthe concealer and the foundation all the other\u00a0\u00a0\nthings are nice I think the product that is\u00a0\nmy most like I definitely can do better than\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is the highlighter and the lip product\u00a0\nI have better things in my collection at a\u00a0\u00a0\nsimilar price point but again we all have\u00a0\ndifferent preferences and that is the fun\u00a0\u00a0\nthing about trying other people's favorites\u00a0\nis that someone comes in with a different\u00a0\u00a0\npreference and a different Viewpoint of what\u00a0\nthey would like their makeup to do and this\u00a0\u00a0\nis mine so I'm not saying that any of these\u00a0\npeople are like not telling you the truth or\u00a0\u00a0\nthat they are giving you suggestions that aren't\u00a0\ngoing to work out for you this is just me giving\u00a0\u00a0\nmy thoughts on other people's suggestions please\u00a0\ncheck out the description box for info about all\u00a0\u00a0\nof the products that I use today if you want to\u00a0\nsee what Shades I used if you want to see

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I fell for it too many times. <br><br>I\u2019ve heard a few Youtubers talk about products that they want to try but they wouldn\u2019t purchase and immediately turn around and ask the brand to send them it as PR. I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on. It just makes me look at them differently.**",

been\u00a0\u00a0\nvery impressed with house Labs I'm even wearing\u00a0\nhouse Labs today this crayon is from house labs\nit's beautiful so I will leave a link to that down\u00a0\nbelow in case you were interested in that release\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't think I have any of these releases and I\u00a0\nhonestly don't think I'm gonna buy any of these\u00a0\u00a0\nreleases either I'm just scrolling through them\u00a0\nright now oh I have these I have the new palettes\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom Urban Decay who thought these were gonna\u00a0\ncome out I was surprised when I got this in PR\u00a0\u00a0\nI opened the box and I my husband was there next\u00a0\nto me and I was like I I don't know what this is\u00a0\u00a0\nI didn't know they were doing a collab with\u00a0\nsmiley but let me go get them because I have them\u00a0\u00a0\nright over Yonder okay so there are two different\u00a0\npalettes it is the Urban Decay Smiley chill happy\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich is the one that is a little bit more\u00a0\non the pinky side it looks like this and then\u00a0\u00a0\nthere is one that's called Mucho happy which is\u00a0\na little bit more on the yellow neutral with a\u00a0\u00a0\npop of a blue over here this yellow is honestly\u00a0\nreally really nice quality I got these and I was\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit surprised but I made a video on\u00a0\nthem and they have been announced now I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nknow when these are being um released but if I\u00a0\nhave some info we'll put it in the description\u00a0\u00a0\nbox but I do have a video on these if you want to\u00a0\nsee two different looks see how I work with these\u00a0\u00a0\npalettes see what I thought about the quality\u00a0\nsee some swatches I will leave that video down\u00a0\u00a0\nbelow because that video is already live I\u00a0\nwas able to play with it uh last weekend so I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink that this was a little bit of a surprising\u00a0\nlaunch am I like super happy that these launch\u00a0\u00a0\nnot really but at least they're a little fun and\u00a0\ncolorful and I do like a smaller palette I'm just\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm just wishing for some more mats in\u00a0\nUrban Decay palettes let's just put it\u00a0\u00a0\nlike that the next thing that I this is the\u00a0\nthing where I'm like oh I actually might pick\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one up if I don't get sent it in PR\u00a0\nand this is the unearthly not in the mood\nwater activated liner palette the front of this\u00a0\none is so cool if you didn't know an Earthly\u00a0\u00a0\nCosmetics is very interesting like owner is very\u00a0\nmuch into art but for most releases she will\u00a0\u00a0\njust hire an artist to paint something or to do\u00a0\nsomething for front of her palettes and this one\u00a0\u00a0\nis a lady looking like a cow and I honestly think\u00a0\nit's super cool I have been a little bit more into\u00a0\u00a0\ngraphic liners and using liners as details lately\u00a0\nand I did buy some um water activated liners and I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink it's really cool to get like a mix of colors\u00a0\nlike this um in your in your palette there's some\u00a0\u00a0\ndark ones there's some light ones I am interested\u00a0\nin seeing more of this I kind of want to see them\u00a0\u00a0\nswatched out but I might actually pick this one up\u00a0\nI do have a cold width on the Earthly Cosmetics my\u00a0\u00a0\ncode is Angelica and you'll get some money off\u00a0\nif you make an order from the side this one says\u00a0\u00a0\nit's coming soon and yeah I'm kind of intrigued\u00a0\nbecause I have been into water activated liners\u00a0\u00a0\nand just colored liners and using them as details\u00a0\nas of lately and there is like like it almost acid\u00a0\u00a0\nlime green in here and that one looks really\u00a0\nreally cool I am about that I also got a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nof tags in this new collection by Matt because I\u00a0\ntold you that my mom used to be a florist and I\u00a0\u00a0\nwanted to gift her some makeup with like flowers\u00a0\nand bees on them and this is also very cute and\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is the MAC Cosmetics collaboration with\u00a0\nRichard Quinn so this is an eyeshadow palette\u00a0\u00a0\na highlighter a bronzer blush duo I think there\u00a0\nseems to be a setting spray that I think just\u00a0\u00a0\nhas the limited edition packaging and then there\u00a0\nare some matte lipsticks and these are from what\u00a0\u00a0\nI can see existing colors Coral Haze lady danger\u00a0\nmare I don't think that these are new shades but\u00a0\u00a0\nI like the packaging a lot the packaging is fun I\u00a0\nsaw a polka dot dress at Sarah today and I'm like\u00a0\u00a0\npolka dots coming back because I'll give you about\u00a0\nthat I listen a really sexy polka dot dress this\u00a0\u00a0\none wasn't like the model wasn't perfect for\u00a0\nme but um I could really see myself getting\u00a0\u00a0\nlike something pocket I really hope polka\u00a0\ndots come back polka dots and leopard print\u00a0\u00a0\nbig fan big big fan the palette let me see if\u00a0\nI can pull up a picture of the palette like a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle bit more so you can actually see let me\u00a0\nactually pull up the swatches of the palette so\u00a0\u00a0\nthat you can see the swatches this seems to be a\u00a0\npastel palette with a black and part of me is like\u00a0\u00a0\nhuh I kind of want to try it because I kind of\u00a0\nwant to see how Mac does pastels is this bad of me\u00a0\u00a0\nI feel like this is bad of me because\u00a0\nlike in the in the actual palette let\u00a0\u00a0\nme pull that one up I love the packaging\u00a0\nin the palette they don't look like much\u00a0\u00a0\nbut like I'm just a little bit curious I mean\u00a0\nI'm not gonna end up part of me is like oh I\u00a0\u00a0\nreally wish that I could try it out but I'm not\u00a0\ngonna pick it up because I am still trying to be\u00a0\u00a0\non a little bit of a lullaby I'm trying to not\u00a0\nbuy everything so I'm trying to be smart with my\u00a0\u00a0\npurchases and I've already decided that the thing\u00a0\nthat I am gonna be picking up are those new Mini\u00a0\u00a0\nPowers let me actually pull those up the ones from\u00a0\nHuda Beauty those are launching on Monday so I\u00a0\u00a0\nwill link those down below as well they're already\u00a0\nup on Sephora those are launching on Monday and\u00a0\u00a0\nI've decided that I'm gonna pick those up but\u00a0\nI will say the Mac collection is really cute so\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah I I just I can't be reviewing everything\u00a0\nand I also have been really enjoying lately\u00a0\u00a0\ndoing videos that are not dedicated with\u00a0\nreviews and I can tell also from you and\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom the engagement that you're really enjoying\u00a0\nthose kind of videos as well so thank you so much\u00a0\u00a0\nby the way for all the support that you've been\u00a0\ngiving my channel lately it it really it makes\u00a0\u00a0\nme happy all the comments and you being excited\u00a0\nabout me trying out some new video ideas like I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nit makes me happy thank you so much for being\u00a0\nso sweet I think by now the glamorizing Chucky\u00a0\u00a0\ncollection is sold out and I don't know if they're\u00a0\ngoing to be restocking or not because they did\u00a0\u00a0\nhave a pre-sale you're gonna have to ask Glam\u00a0\nlight about that but they might restock because\u00a0\u00a0\nthey actually did announce that there are a couple\u00a0\nof things I will put up just a sneak peek here\u00a0\u00a0\nthere are a couple of things that they're thinking\u00a0\nabout that they probably had in this launch that\u00a0\u00a0\nthey weren't able to launch for this first launch\u00a0\nthat they might release later she talked about\u00a0\u00a0\nlashes I know she talked about a makeup bag uh\u00a0\nso you're gonna have to let Glam like know if you\u00a0\u00a0\nwould like to see more things in this collection\u00a0\nshe also did hint that they have some more horror\u00a0\u00a0\num collabs coming in 2023 and she also has said\u00a0\nfrom before that they are doing around two with\u00a0\u00a0\nScooby-Doo which makes me really happy because\u00a0\nI loved the Scooby-Doo palette with a burning\u00a0\u00a0\npassion so yeah I feel like there's a lot of\u00a0\nfun things in work she also showed us a sneak\u00a0\u00a0\npeek of a palette that is non-licensed like just\u00a0\nglamor light that is also she's hoping to bring\u00a0\u00a0\nout towards the end of the year so I'm really\u00a0\nexcited to see the fun things that are coming\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom Glam light my Copic land light is also\u00a0\ningestion you can save some money off and if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou want to see my video on the Chucky collection\u00a0\nthat one is live on my channel if you want to see\u00a0\u00a0\nhow that collection was I actually also yesterday\u00a0\nput up a reel on my channel where I was using the\u00a0\u00a0\nChucky palette together with the Barbie palette\u00a0\nbecause I mentioned in my review of the Chucky\u00a0\u00a0\npalette that I felt like those were just meant\u00a0\nto be together and I loved the look that I did\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a lavender black moment ugh super pretty and\u00a0\nyeah I think that it could be interesting if they\u00a0\u00a0\nwere to do like a restock of the collection and\u00a0\nalso launch some of these new products with that\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I feel like there are some really cool\u00a0\nthings that she has been talking about and I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nexcited to see what it is all about this one\u00a0\nmakes me a little confused um and I think uh\u00a0\u00a0\nokay let me let me start like this this is the\u00a0\nNew Foundation by girla and this one is meant to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe a terracotta lattained foundation and it\u00a0\nis a velvety Luminous Finish with buildable\u00a0\u00a0\ncoverage combining the lightness and Radiance of\u00a0\npowder for natural feel but this is the Terracotta\u00a0\u00a0\nlatent and you can clearly see in the before\u00a0\nand after picture that she is a little like\u00a0\u00a0\na tint darker and the Terracotta line from girl\u00a0\nland it's their bronzer line so I'm like is this\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a little tint to make it look a little bit\u00a0\nmore tan because I've been seeing a lot of people\u00a0\u00a0\nbeing super excited about the bronzino drops by\u00a0\ndrunk elephant which is basically like a couple of\u00a0\u00a0\nbronzer drops that you put in your like in your\u00a0\nmoisturizer and makes your skin look just a like\u00a0\u00a0\nit has a little bit of a bronzy glow without\u00a0\nbeing like a selfless Tanner it's a selfless\u00a0\u00a0\nTanner sunless tanner oh my oh my but yeah I\u00a0\nam not about that life I I just I'm not seeing\u00a0\u00a0\nwell to be fair now that I think of it because\u00a0\nit's like for me for example for me I always do\u00a0\u00a0\nself tanner when I'm not out in the sun and when\u00a0\nI'm out in the sun my my tan I still have 10 lines\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom last summer my my tan stays for quite some\u00a0\ntime and my face I always lose my tan because I\u00a0\u00a0\nexfoliate so I guess the foundation that gives\u00a0\na little bit of a tint would be good but this is\u00a0\u00a0\na white girl problem problem I'm using that that\u00a0\nword very Loosely here that's a white girl problem\u00a0\u00a0\nso is this a foundation made\u00a0\nfor white girls that like to tan\nIsn't that with most makeup I I\u00a0\ndon't know I'm this is just me\nthinking out loud I would love to hear your\u00a0\nthoughts about this but I will say it made me\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit confused about the Terracotta name\u00a0\nof it because the Terracotta is their bronzer\u00a0\u00a0\nline or maybe they're just expanding and it's a\u00a0\nfoundation and she's just looking a little Tanner\u00a0\u00a0\non her face and maybe she's not maybe that maybe\u00a0\nI need new glasses again it's me thinking out loud\u00a0\u00a0\nI would love to hear your thoughts if you don't\u00a0\nagree with me that's perfectly fine I could have\u00a0\u00a0\nmissed something for sure maybe the Terracotta\u00a0\nline it's not their bronzer line at all what do\u00a0\u00a0\nI know I know that Dominique Cosmetics is doing\u00a0\na restock and she's also coming out with a new\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor of her uh soft focus setting powders and\u00a0\nthe new shade is the pink shade I feel like the\u00a0\u00a0\nhype that was around the Huda beauty pink powder\u00a0\nis probably gonna make every single makeup brand\u00a0\u00a0\nUnder the Sun come out with the pink powder just\u00a0\nwatch the rest of 2023 and the beginning of 2024\u00a0\u00a0\njust be a barrage of pink loose powders you heard\u00a0\nit here first maybe you didn't but you heard it\u00a0\u00a0\nhere as well there is a new collection between\u00a0\nelf and ohima bonsu and she is doing a favorites\u00a0\u00a0\nbox this is the elf by ohema bonso Beauty Box this\u00a0\nis a curated makeup and skincare bundle containing\u00a0\u00a0\nnine of ohema's current favorite products you can\u00a0\nbuy it at Elf cosmetics and you will save 25 off\u00a0\u00a0\nwith the code ohima 25. there is a bunch of really\u00a0\ngood products in here like the power grip four\u00a0\u00a0\npercent niacinamide I've been using that a lot\u00a0\nlately and I've really been enjoying it there's\u00a0\u00a0\nalso lip Plumping gloss mascara makeup melting\u00a0\ncleansing balm the brow lift applicator the potty\u00a0\u00a0\nblush brush oh there's some really oh that's a\u00a0\nbrow lift product as well I've heard some really\u00a0\u00a0\ngood things about that should I try the brow\u00a0\nlift the product from Elf is that good because\u00a0\u00a0\nI also saw that colourpop had their brow lift\u00a0\nproduct and at Target is that good should I try\u00a0\u00a0\ntell me should I try it or any of these any good\u00a0\nI would love to hear all about it but yeah these\u00a0\u00a0\nare available now this box is available now I\u00a0\nwill link it down below big congratulations to\u00a0\u00a0\nohema for being able to curate a favorites box\u00a0\nwithout oh I forgot to tell you about this as\u00a0\u00a0\nwell glossier is now available at Sephora if you\u00a0\nhad been eyeing glossier and you wanted to buy\u00a0\u00a0\nit from Sephora instead it says it is online only\u00a0\nright now maybe it will come back in or come into\u00a0\u00a0\nstores later but right now it says online only so\u00a0\ncheck it out if you're interested I will leave a\u00a0\u00a0\nlink down below it's not all of the products but\u00a0\nI will say there's quite a lot of products I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nalmost a little bit surprised at how many of the\u00a0\nproducts and maybe some of them will be in store\u00a0\u00a0\nand like the full collection is online I don't\u00a0\nknow if you see them in store let us know in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe comments so we know what's outer waiting for\u00a0\nus there's also a new concealer coming this is\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom Valentino this is the very Valentino 24-hour\u00a0\nwear hydrating concealer it is a multi-use creamy\u00a0\u00a0\nlightweight concealer that delivers medium\u00a0\ncoverage and brightens Skin's Radiance for\u00a0\u00a0\ncreaseless finish that lasts all day 35 dollars\u00a0\nin 20 different shades it is coming soon to their\u00a0\u00a0\nwebsite and to the retailer so it's coming to\u00a0\nSephora as well I don't think I'm gonna be trying\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one out a lot of people have been saying\u00a0\nthat they've really really love the Valentino\u00a0\u00a0\nFoundation but it is very expensive it's very\u00a0\nexpensive have I seen it in stores somewhere\u00a0\u00a0\nyes where did I see it in stores that was in LA\u00a0\nmaybe 100 sure I just feel like let me rephrase\u00a0\u00a0\nthis I don't mind high-end makeup but for the\u00a0\nmost part luxury makeup just isn't for me I\u00a0\u00a0\nhaven't tried any Tom Ford yet I have tried some\u00a0\nGucci beauty though and I don't know what what\u00a0\u00a0\nabout Gucci that draws me in more than Tom Ford\u00a0\nand Valentino maybe it's because Gucci fashion\u00a0\u00a0\nis a little bit more fun so maybe I'm like\u00a0\nexpecting the makeup to be a little bit more\u00a0\u00a0\nfun that's interesting or maybe it's because\u00a0\nI had a Gucci counter in Sweden that I could\u00a0\u00a0\nvisit that could also be it let me know do you\u00a0\nhave a luxury brand where you're like somehow\u00a0\u00a0\nthat feels more fun than other brands for me\u00a0\nit would be Gucci but yeah this concealer is\u00a0\u00a0\ncoming soon I think I'm gonna skip because I have\u00a0\na lot of concealers that I really love including\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one that I'm wearing today it is a beautiful\u00a0\nconcealer absolutely wonderful like I said it's in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe pinned comment I don't feel like I need to try\u00a0\na luxury concealer when I can find bulk drugstore\u00a0\u00a0\nand high-end ones that I really like there is a\u00a0\nnew collection coming from Wet and Wild and this\u00a0\u00a0\nis a collab with Sesame Street I like this one a\u00a0\nlot more than like the hip Dot and Sesame Street\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause that one was either the stupid Kinder\u00a0\nEgg figurines or there were palettes with pressed\u00a0\u00a0\nGlitters and neither of those were something that\u00a0\nI was interested in I don't know if I necessarily\u00a0\u00a0\nneed anything of this either it seems to be\u00a0\nlipsticks lip scrubs and like lip treatments\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's like a setting spray there's an eyeshadow\u00a0\npalette there's some trios for the face I think\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's a bunch of different things from what I\u00a0\ncan see of these pictures this is a big collection\u00a0\u00a0\nand it seems that people have been spotting these\u00a0\nin stores so if you are a big Sesame Street fan I\u00a0\u00a0\nwould definitely say to go to a place where you\u00a0\nthink wet and wild is available and see if you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan find it I'll try and scour the internet and\u00a0\nsee if I can find it online as well but I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nthink that this is going to be something that I\u00a0\nrun out and get even though I think it looks cute\u00a0\u00a0\none of the reasons why I am not head over heels\u00a0\nfor Wet and Wild is that I actually do appreciate\u00a0\u00a0\na packaging that's just a little bit more elevated\u00a0\nthan the Wet and Wild Ones not that I think that\u00a0\u00a0\nlike packaging really matters like if a product\u00a0\nis good it's good but at the end of the day and\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is just me I know myself and when it comes to\u00a0\nthe makeup that I reach for on a daily basis like\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen I'm not reviewing something on YouTube I tend\u00a0\nto reach for stuff that has good makeup and good\u00a0\u00a0\npackaging I kind of need the full package but let\u00a0\nme know if you're a big fan of Sesame Street I I\u00a0\u00a0\nactually don't even know if I watch Sesame Street\u00a0\nas a kid I can't remember any of this any of these\u00a0\u00a0\ncharacters not it doesn't ring a bell speaking\u00a0\nof nostalgia collapse there's also a club coming\u00a0\u00a0\nbetween uh Catrice and My Little Pony the original\u00a0\nretro My Little Pony this collection the first one\u00a0\u00a0\nI saw this I was like oh this is so cute so cute\u00a0\nand I looked a little closer at it and I'm like\u00a0\u00a0\nthis all looks something about these Shadows\u00a0\nlook cheap to me and I know it seems harsh to\u00a0\u00a0\njudge something just based on how they look in the\u00a0\npan but sometimes you can tell with undertones of\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup but this seems weird I hear I hear listen\u00a0\nI hear what you're hearing I hear it I you don't\u00a0\u00a0\nhave to tell me but sometimes with undertones\u00a0\nof makeup I can tell this this is just generic\u00a0\u00a0\nprobably low quality makeup I I know it sounds\u00a0\nharsh but like just looking at this I'm like\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't I don't think so and I might be maybe I'm\u00a0\nlike totally speaking out of my ass right now I\u00a0\u00a0\ndid see that my friend Nikki Raven said that she\u00a0\nwas going to pick this up and review it because\u00a0\u00a0\nit's launching in Europe first catrice's European\u00a0\nbrand so I am intrigued to see what she thinks of\u00a0\u00a0\nit maybe I'll change my mind when I see it but\u00a0\njust based on my initial feeling when I saw this\u00a0\u00a0\nand maybe this is just me Low by Angie trying\u00a0\nto talk myself out of makeup listen I need the\u00a0\u00a0\nsmallest reasons to talk myself out of makeup\u00a0\nright now because I have so much makeup I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nneed to buy all of it but I think I'm gonna skip\u00a0\nit I think the thing that I think are the cutest\u00a0\u00a0\nare those pastel nail polishes those look cute\u00a0\nand there's also another thing coming from Catrice\u00a0\u00a0\nwhere did I put it oh it's here these are I think\u00a0\nthese are available in the US as well and these\u00a0\u00a0\nare the shine bomb lipsticks 10 different shades\u00a0\nand there are nudes to bolds the say shine bomb so\u00a0\u00a0\nI guess think this is a shinier lipstick they look\u00a0\nreally cute I will link them down below some of\u00a0\u00a0\nthose nudes look like they could be up my alley is\u00a0\nthat orange really an orange or is it like a coral\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause we all know that I'm down for an orange\u00a0\nlipstick but I don't like my oranges to be blended\u00a0\u00a0\ninto pink so they're Coral I want them to be a\u00a0\nyellow based orange and very few lipsticks or\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup products all together are that but it looks\u00a0\npromising maybe that could be for me and speaking\u00a0\u00a0\nof yellow toned oranges even though I will say\u00a0\nthat maybe the color isn't show this this here\u00a0\u00a0\nthis picture here there's some sneak peeks from\u00a0\nLH cosmetics and then together with just them\u00a0\u00a0\ndoing some swatches I'm guessing this is\u00a0\neither lipsticks or cream blushes this is\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat I'm guessing something new is coming soon\u00a0\navailable February 24th isn't that the day that\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is going up I will link it down below\u00a0\nI don't know what it is but I will link it\u00a0\u00a0\ndown below maybe I'm able to show you another\u00a0\npicture here as well I have no idea let me see\u00a0\u00a0\nif they've showed anything oh there are two new\u00a0\nshades coming in the Fantastic Sunstone and topaz\u00a0\u00a0\noh okay I need to make an order I need to make\u00a0\nan order because they're using an orange heart\nthey're using an orange heart listen if I can find\u00a0\u00a0\na picture I will put it here instead\u00a0\nyou're probably already seeing that\u00a0\u00a0\nI think it's time for me to make an order and\u00a0\nbuy those because they're they're showing Orange\nI love I love the Fantastics from LH\u00a0\nCosmetics that is probably my favorite\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts from LH Cosmetics followed by\u00a0\nthe Crayons followed by that duo blush\u00a0\u00a0\nthat they just released those are wonderful is\u00a0\nit time for me to milk in LH Cosmetics order\nelectric Cosmetics is also available at Beauty Bay\u00a0\u00a0\nI will try and remember to\u00a0\nlink that down below as well\nhuh I think it's time let's talk about some\u00a0\nperfumes listen there are some perfumes coming out\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't think that any of these are perfect for me\u00a0\nbut I thought I'd let you know a lot of people are\u00a0\u00a0\nsaying the Good Girl by Carolina Herrera is one of\u00a0\ntheir favorite perfumes and she's coming out with\u00a0\u00a0\nanother flanker and this is the good girl blush\u00a0\nof the parfum and this is like a pink shoe I think\u00a0\u00a0\nthis bottle is ugly as fluff this is the gaudiest\u00a0\nugliest ball ever if you think it's pretty like\u00a0\u00a0\nyou do you but I don't think this is pretty at all\u00a0\nI think this perfume is actually smelling like the\u00a0\u00a0\noriginal good girl smells really good but it is\u00a0\na floraly perfume and that is not for me I don't\u00a0\u00a0\ndo florals perfumes this one the flanker one is\u00a0\nBergamot and Mandarin and top notes and then it\u00a0\u00a0\nis yilang ylang and peony in the heart notes and\u00a0\nvanilla absolute and Tonka being in the base notes\u00a0\u00a0\nagain floral perfume not for me it is the same\u00a0\nwith this one from Yo Malone this is the Nashi\u00a0\u00a0\nBlossom cologne and this is actually exclusive\u00a0\ninclusive to selfridges I will link it down below\u00a0\u00a0\nand this one has lemon in the top notes Nashi\u00a0\nBlossom which I have no idea what that is ever\u00a0\u00a0\nif I'm pronouncing it correctly in the heart notes\u00a0\nand in the bass notes it is white musk I love Joe\u00a0\u00a0\nMalone I think that Joe Malone has well the Yom\u00a0\nalone is no longer with Joe Malone she actually\u00a0\u00a0\nhas another perfume brand now that is called yo\u00a0\nloves but the brand Joe Malone I think they're\u00a0\u00a0\nreally good at making fragrances that are wearable\u00a0\nbut a little bit different they're like the bridge\u00a0\u00a0\nbetween traditional like mainstream perfumes and\u00a0\nmore like Niche perfumes I feel like Jo Malone\u00a0\u00a0\nis in the bridge in between so I really like the\u00a0\nthings that they do but this one isn't going to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe for me because again it's it's a blossom and\u00a0\nusually I don't do blossomy perfumes and it's\u00a0\u00a0\nthe exact same with this one this is Goldfield\u00a0\nand Banks Australia and this is their Island\u00a0\u00a0\nLush and this says that this is part of their\u00a0\nBotanical series and it is sandalwood and wild\u00a0\u00a0\ntropical Beauty um so yeah it's it's woods and\u00a0\ntropical flowers I actually have let me go get\u00a0\u00a0\nit because I have one of their perfumes and it\u00a0\nis delicious so this is the one that I have from\u00a0\u00a0\nGoldfield and Banks and this is in Sunset hour\u00a0\nthis is a beautiful perfume I will link this\u00a0\u00a0\none down below as well I actually oh it smells\u00a0\nso good if you know if you don't know me I love\u00a0\u00a0\nperfumes I love perfume more than I love makeup\u00a0\ndon't come for me and I especially love unisex\u00a0\u00a0\nperfumes or more masculinity perfumes and one of\u00a0\nmy favorite type of perfumes is perfumes that are\u00a0\u00a0\nfruity but not florally and fruity but not too\u00a0\nsweet this is a unisex fruity perfume and it is\nvery fruity but still not overly feminine so\u00a0\ndefinitely a wonderful it's almost pineapple\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't remember exactly the notes but it this\u00a0\nis a this is like an island vacation in a bottle\u00a0\u00a0\nwithout being too florally or too feminine I went\u00a0\nthrough a sample of this one I talked about this\u00a0\u00a0\nin a perfume I'm gonna do an updated perfume video\u00a0\nsoon I promise and I used up the sample and when\u00a0\u00a0\nmy husband asked me what I wanted for my birthday\u00a0\nI actually asked for this one so he bought me this\u00a0\u00a0\none it is for sale um on department stores like I\u00a0\nsaid I will link it down below but I don't think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat this florally one is going to be for me\u00a0\nthere is one that's called something Moss Rock\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething Rock Moss that one is my second favorite\u00a0\nand eventually I will get that one and I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nthink that this is like a full size I think this\u00a0\nis like 50 mil yeah this is 50 mil nobody needs\u00a0\u00a0\n100 Mil unless it's like your absolute signature\u00a0\nperfume just letting you know you don't need\u00a0\u00a0\nthat and since it's coming out with a blush and\u00a0\nhighlighter palette so this is the peachy Blossom\u00a0\u00a0\nblush and highlighter palette this is available\u00a0\nin Europe right now it is 599 Euros so these\u00a0\u00a0\nare three different blushes and two different\u00a0\nhighlighters I think this looks really cute I\u00a0\u00a0\nknow there's a lot of people out there that really\u00a0\nlove a blush palette and I'm excited to see that\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's one like affordable active drugstore\u00a0\nI don't know when this is coming to the US if\u00a0\u00a0\nI can find it I will link it down below but I\u00a0\ndo think it looks really cute three different\u00a0\u00a0\nblushes two different highlighters I don't know\u00a0\nhow pigmented they are so I don't know how over\u00a0\u00a0\nhow many skin tones it's gonna stretch but I don't\u00a0\nhate this release I think it looks fairly cute\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's also a spring release from profusion\u00a0\nI still have not tried profusion do I need to\u00a0\u00a0\ndo I need to try profusion you're gonna have to\u00a0\nlet me know it's not gonna be this release though\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause this is not for me at all this is the uh\u00a0\nthis is like a empowered butterfly collection that\u00a0\u00a0\npalette looks like another thing that's found at\u00a0\nthe reject bin over at Claire's absolutely not it\u00a0\u00a0\nis very mid-tone it's got some shades that look\u00a0\nlike they're like marbled or something it's just\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething about that palette just it doesn't\u00a0\nscream high quality to me they have some other\u00a0\u00a0\npalettes that look amazing this one just isn't\u00a0\nfor me and I also don't like that the only shadow\u00a0\u00a0\nthat seems to be even the slightest dark is a dark\u00a0\nbrown in that big of a palette I am I'm gonna need\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething more than a mid-tone rainbow maybe I'm\u00a0\nbeing too harsh again if I can find the smallest\u00a0\u00a0\nreason to not buy makeup that makes me happy I\u00a0\nwill say the blushes look really cute one is a\u00a0\u00a0\npink with orange and one is an orange with pink\u00a0\nI could be about that the dazzling Wings a liquid\u00a0\u00a0\nShimmer eyeliner Duo also sounds interesting\u00a0\nmoose blushes like moose not like moose\u00a0\u00a0\nnot like the animal like musi Lip Cream set\u00a0\nglassy lip gloss set lip mask face stickers\u00a0\u00a0\nthat sounds like something for eight-year-olds\u00a0\nI don't know why all the lips are in sets that\u00a0\u00a0\nis one of my also pet peeves and I know there\u00a0\nare brands that I love that do that as well I\u00a0\u00a0\nlike to be able to buy the lip products\u00a0\nseparately because I don't want to add\u00a0\u00a0\nthree lipsticks at the same time I just want to\u00a0\nbuy the one can just let me buy the one I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nhate this collection but I really dislike\u00a0\nhow the palette looks that blush though\u00a0\u00a0\ncould be a board this is one thing that I\u00a0\nactually think looks incredibly interesting\u00a0\u00a0\nand if this works they could have a hit on their\u00a0\nhands and this is the new Sun treats SPF 50 makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nfixing Mist by Pixie Beauty this is an invisible\u00a0\nbroad spectrum SPF 50 Mist protects High rates\u00a0\u00a0\nand Suits skin you can use this under or over\u00a0\nmakeup which means that you can bring this along\u00a0\u00a0\nand just reapply sunscreen throughout the day\u00a0\nwith a mister of course the Mist is not going\u00a0\u00a0\nto give you 50 SPF unless you use like a lot\u00a0\nbut it's still going to give you that little\u00a0\u00a0\nextra protection so that you can just up your\u00a0\nsunscreen a little bit throughout the day and\u00a0\u00a0\nI honestly think that that sounds really really\u00a0\ncool this is going to be 15 which honestly if\u00a0\u00a0\nthis works that's a pretty good price for that\u00a0\nand it is available now I will link it down\u00a0\u00a0\nbelow I feel like this could be a hit if it works\u00a0\nand it doesn't like totally melt your makeup off\u00a0\u00a0\nlike this could work let me know what you think\u00a0\ndown below are you like an SPF expert let it let\u00a0\u00a0\nme know your thoughts there's also another\u00a0\nStrawberry Shortcake collection and this is\u00a0\u00a0\nby hanida hanida like duh like the French duh\u00a0\nhoneyde I think so this is a license collection\u00a0\u00a0\nand it is four different palettes and each palette\u00a0\nis scented as well I don't know if they're sent a\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent scents or if it's one cent I'm not 100\u00a0\nsure the pre-order is opening on the 27th I will\u00a0\u00a0\nsay I really don't like palettes or like cut out\u00a0\nas figures if they're again it's going back to the\u00a0\u00a0\nI have so much good makeup in my collection and\u00a0\nwhen I reach for makeup when I'm not reviewing it\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna reach for something that is good inside\u00a0\nthe packaging and also like has a good packaging\u00a0\u00a0\nI need both and I have realized with time that I\u00a0\nreally don't like pack like packages that are like\u00a0\u00a0\nshaped like figurines like this I don't have\u00a0\nany of those in my collection at this point I\u00a0\u00a0\nreally do not want to add any either I will say if\u00a0\nyou're a huge Strawberry Shortcake fan maybe this\u00a0\u00a0\nis perfect for you I personally prefer the one\u00a0\nthat Glam light has because it is a rectangular\u00a0\u00a0\npalette and I can just store it with my others\u00a0\nbut I understand that not everyone has the same\u00a0\u00a0\npreferences as me but that's just how I feel\u00a0\nabout it I call her story especially the one in\u00a0\u00a0\ngreen green striped palette the blue and the\u00a0\ngreen and the orange that looks really cute I\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't think this is going to be for me though but\u00a0\nI wanted to let you know and then let's end with\u00a0\u00a0\nthat the fact that um benefit is coming out with\u00a0\nskincare I think benefit has had skin care before\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't think that this is their first go at\u00a0\nskincare if I'm not totally just making stuff up\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I think it feels like a natural fit for them\u00a0\nto have the professional skincare I personally\u00a0\u00a0\nand maybe some people that watch me disagree but\u00a0\nI personally don't battle with enlarged pores and\u00a0\u00a0\nif you think that my part pores are enlarged\u00a0\nat least that's not something that bothers me\u00a0\u00a0\nif I have enlarged pores at least it doesn't\u00a0\nbother me and it's not one of the parts of my\u00a0\u00a0\nface that I am trying to check I'm not trying to\u00a0\nyou understand what I'm trying to come from here\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is coming on February 26th to Ulta I think\u00a0\nyou can already see the listings I will link it\u00a0\u00a0\ndown below but it is like a smooth pore mask foam\u00a0\ncleanser a deep Retreat mask Titan tone toner oil\u00a0\u00a0\ncleanser all-in-one mask one poor care cleansing\u00a0\nwand so it's one oh it's one of those that could\u00a0\u00a0\nbe about and then the moisturizer I could be\u00a0\nabout that cleansing one I might get that one I\u00a0\u00a0\nmight get that one if you saw my video where I was\u00a0\ntalking about brands that kicked me off their PR\u00a0\u00a0\nlist you know that I mentioned Benefit Cosmetics\u00a0\nno hard feelings no hard feelings at all I did\u00a0\u00a0\nactually receive a PR package from uh benefit\u00a0\nlast Sunday which was very simple and also from\u00a0\u00a0\nlike because I mentioned Urban decays as well so\u00a0\nI don't know if I'm back or if they just slipped\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe they slipped and accidentally sent me\u00a0\nsomething but again no hard feelings I think\u00a0\u00a0\nI will actually now that I look at it by that one\u00a0\nbecause I used to have one of those cleaning ones\u00a0\u00a0\nactually really nice especially when you have\u00a0\na full full face of makeup like I have today\u00a0\u00a0\nlike you know you have skincare and sunscreen and\u00a0\nmakeup and foundation and concealer and powder and\u00a0\u00a0\neyeshadow one of those is really nice to just get\u00a0\nall of the gunk out on your skin so that actually\u00a0\u00a0\nmight be for me but other than that I don't think\u00a0\nthat this is going to be the skincare brand for\u00a0\u00a0\nme but I will say that the professional primers\u00a0\nactually I think those are good primers they have\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent ones for different skin types I like the\u00a0\none that's a light that's the one that I'm using\u00a0\u00a0\nI think that is really moisturizing but not too\u00a0\nheavy on my combo skin so I really do enjoy that\u00a0\u00a0\none but yeah I don't think that this skincare\u00a0\nrelease is going to be exactly for me I already\u00a0\u00a0\nhave a bunch of skincare products that I use and\u00a0\nlove but let me know if you're interested in this\u00a0\u00a0\nand I think that's going to be it for today's\u00a0\nvideo let me know which are the ones that you are\u00a0\u00a0\nthe most interested in I feel holy holy bananas\u00a0\nI think for me that LH Cosmetics lipstick drop\u00a0\u00a0\ngot me more excited than I thought it was gonna be\u00a0\nso I think that will be the one for me where I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nlike actually when that launches tomorrow I think\u00a0\nI'm gonna be on the site buying that because I am\u00a0\u00a0\nvery very intrigued by that one oh I forgot to\u00a0\ntalk about one thing let me just lean over and\u00a0\u00a0\nwe can put it here fantasy Cosmetics has showed us\u00a0\na sneak peek she's coming out with a rogue palette\u00a0\u00a0\nand I am very very intrigued we'll talk more about\u00a0\nthis next week because I'm sure that she will show\u00a0\u00a0\nme the inside by then she also told me that she's\u00a0\nsending me this palette in PR my comb with fantasy\u00a0\u00a0\ncosmetica is and Jessica and you can say 10 off\u00a0\nyour order I am super intrigued to see how this\u00a0\u00a0\npalette looks in real life because I have seen\u00a0\npictures of the inside and it looks oh it looks\u00a0\u00a0\nsuper super pretty so we'll talk more about that\u00a0\nnext week but I didn't want to forget to let you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow about it because I'm not 100 sure if this\u00a0\none launches before next week's episode just\u00a0\u00a0\nwanted to let you know what's coming out but yeah\u00a0\nI think those LH Cosmetics ones are gonna be the\u00a0\u00a0\nones that I'm the most intrigued by and I'm also\u00a0\nvery intrigued by those uh liners by an Earthly\u00a0\u00a0\nCosmetics because I've been using a lot of liners\u00a0\nand because I really like America Cosmetics I just\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of want to see some swatches before I 100\u00a0\nmake up my mind but let me know your thoughts down\u00a0\u00a0\nbelow don't forget to subscribe and I will see you\u00a0\nagain on well probably Monday for a new video bye\n[Music] [Applause]\n[Music]",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

She lies about the false lashes and then didn&#39;t respond about it at all and she hid the sponsored statement and doubled down on her lies and made a joke out of her actions in subsequent videos. She has used filters too.  She has yet to apologize and she shouldn&#39;t be given the benefit of the doubt at all. That ship sailed.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on.

        "transcript_text": "- Credo Beauty Best Sellers.\nIf you're a clean beauty lover,\nthis is for you.\nWe have quite a bit of\ndifferent makeup brands\nthat are all clean\nwith some of the best selling makeup\non Credo Beauty.\nAnd all these makeup products,\nI've either featured in my\nvideos multiple times\nbecause they're incredible,\nor I just use them on a\nweekly or even daily basis.\nI'm excited.\nLet's jump into it.\nLet's start first with a primer by Exa.\nThis is their Jump Start Smoothing Primer.\nI like this one because it's\nnot a completely matte primer.\nIt's semi-matte.\nThat's kind of how they describe it.\nI would say it's a great smoothing primer.\nIt doesn't fill in your pores entirely.\nIt just creates a really nice, even base.\nAnd I like to warm it up\nbefore I go on my face\nand work in areas where\nI need to smooth my skin,\nwhich is mostly my T-zone.\nYou can see on the forehead,\nit just kind of evened everything out.\nBut I still have a little\nbit of glow from within.\nA best selling foundation on Credo Beauty\nis the Westman Atelier Foundation Stick.\nThis one I, I like.\nI like it a lot because it's\nkind of like a two in one.\nYou can use it as a\nconcealer or a foundation,\nbut I like the packaging because\nit's a stick, it's\nfunctional, it's convenient,\nit's versatile, it's\nvery easy to travel with.\nBut this formula is really beautiful\nbecause it's very natural.\nIt's almost like a second skin-like\ntype of a foundation.\nYou can blend it out with your fingers,\nor you can blend it out\nusing more of like a dense\nfoundation brush.\nI personally don't want to use\na dampened sponge with this,\n'cause I find that it\nshears it out way too much.\nAnd this is in shade, 0.5.\nI'm gonna take my Merit Foundation brush\nand just start dabbing the\nfoundation into my skin.\nJust see how natural that is...\nCredo's Beauty's best\nsellers for eyebrows,\nthere are so many options,\nbut these two are the\nones I'm gonna feature\nin today's video.\nWe're gonna use Westman Atelier's,\ntheir Brow Defining Pencil in shade, Bark.\nWhen I tried this first, I\ndidn't know how I felt about it,\njust because (laughing)\nthe pencil itself is larger than I prefer.\nIt's a lot bigger, kind\nof like an oblong shape.\nBut the formula itself is really nice because\nyou can do your eyebrows really\nquickly using this pencil.\nIt has a little spooly attached.\nNow I'm just gonna\nquickly fill in my brows.\nThis pencil almost has a pomade texture,\nso it sticks to your brow's hair,\nbrow hairs really well.\nKosas Air Brow Gel in Clear\nis another best seller on Credo Beauty.\nThis one is great.\nKosas eyebrow products are phenomenal.\nThe only thing I don't\nlike about this brow gel,\nit's not as longlasting as, let's say,\nmy Benefit 24 Hour Brow Gel.\nIt's not one of those.\nIt's more of a natural\nbrow gel, which is great,\nespecially if you already have\na beautiful eyebrow shape.\nSome of my brow hairs, they\njust wanna do their own thing,\nand they need a very intense brow gel.\nBut this one is really great\nbecause your brows are\ngonna be very light, fluffy,\nbut it's not as strong-hold as some other ones.\nSo moving on.\nWe're gonna move on to cream contour.\nThis is one of the best\nsellers by Westman Atelier,\nin shade, Biscuit.\nThis is just my shade,\nbut the contour stick,\nthis is incredible.\nI can't stop using it.\nI think it's a wonderful contour product.\nIt's also very foolproof.\nI'm gonna use it with my\nMakeup by Mario, the F1 brush,\nand I'm gonna take it right onto the brush\ninstead of drawing it to my face,\njust because I really want\nmore of a softer contour.\nYou guys are gonna see that\na lot of these brands are\njust great best sellers\nor just top sellers on Credo Beauty,\njust because as a brand, as a\nwhole, they're a clean brand\nand they produce\nbeautiful makeup products.\n[Andrey] Pricey also, right?\nVery pricey.\nThis is definitely a luxury\nsplurge-worthy makeup brand.\nBut I'm using the products that\nI think are worth splurging\non yourself.\nTreat yourself.\nA best selling concealer on Credo Beauty,\nKosas Revealer Concealer.\nIt's no surprise, it's\na beautiful concealer.\nIt's super creamy, it's very brightening.\nIt's very, very delicious under the eyes.\nIt doesn't do anything\nweird to your under eyes.\nThe only thing I will say,\nit's not as long wearing on me,\nand the shade range.\nEven though I have 1.5\nC, which is cool toned,\nit leans more yellow on my skin tone.\nThat's why I'm not the biggest fan of\nwearing this concealer all the time.\nLike that's very yellow on my skin tone.\nI wish it was a little more cool toned.\nBut this concealer, it's so easy to wear.\nIt's so easy to use, so easy to blend.\nIt layers really, really well\nwithout looking heavy or crepey.\nBut like I said, it doesn't\nwear as long under my eyes\nif I don't set it.\nTo blend, I'm gonna use my\nRare Beauty concealer brush.\nI just like how it kind\nof mimics your fingertip.\nI would say I get true medium\ncoverage with this concealer.\nBut you can see it's a little,\nit's a little yellow under my under eyes.\nAnd I have other shades\nand this is the closest\none that looks best\nwith my skin tone.\nAnd I'm gonna take my foundation brush\nwithout any foundation,\njust whatever is left.\nI'm just gonna lightly tap,\njust to help blend it even more.\nThe finish is very natural,\nhas a little bit of radiant,\nlittle bit of a glow.\nIt's a really beautiful\neveryday concealer.\nIlia is another all-around\nbrand that is so highly rated,\nand one of the best\nsellers on Credo Beauty.\nA lot of their products,\nthey're also very effortless.\nThey're very minimal, very easy to use.\nThey wear really well throughout the day,\nand this is one of them.\nThis is the Ilia's, their\nMulti-Stick in shade, Tenderly.\nI'm gonna use this as my blush.\nI do like these multi-sticks.\nI just really, really,\nreally have to warm them up.\nto get them to a nice creamy consistency.\nOtherwise, if you go\nstraight onto your face,\nit just kind of sticks and doesn't glide\nas smooth and even.\nThey're on the sheer side,\nso you do wanna build them up.\nBut again, Ilia, I find\nthat they're more of a\nvery minimal type of a makeup brand,\nkind of like Merit,\nwhere it's not a ton of\npigment on your face,\nbut more natural and very skin-like.\nI'm actually gonna take my\nRare Beauty Blush Brush.\nI like this kind of\nbrush for cream products.\nIt's kind of like a stippling brush,\nbut extremely soft and very dense,\nand it just works really\nwell with cream formulas.\nThe finish is very radiant, illuminating,\njust beautiful on the cheeks.\nAnd to get the best wear\nout of these blushes,\nor these multi-sticks,\nI would set them either\nwith a loose powder\nor a powder blush highlighter,\nbronzer, or whatever\non top just to get as much wear\nout of this product as possible.\nTo set my face, I'm gonna\nuse one of my favorite\nsetting powders.\nAnd of course, no surprise,\nit's a best seller on Credo.\nThis is Ilia's Soft\nFocus Finishing Powder.\nI've talked about this one multiple times\nand I still can't get enough of it.\nIt's a beautiful, loose setting\npowder that's translucent,\nand I just love the way\nit looks on the skin.\nIt just sets everything in place,\nbut it doesn't mattify to a\npoint where you look very dull\nand very one-dimensional.\nJust take some on into the cap.\nThis is by Beauty Blender and\nthis is their powder puff,\nor I'm not even sure what\nthey call it, but it's a puff.\nAnd just gently press and tap\nwhere I want to set my makeup.\nAnd if you do get extremely\noily throughout the day,\nthis powder, it layers really\nwell without looking heavy\nor cakey or breaking your makeup apart.\nI'm gonna use another Ilia (laughing)\nmakeup product.\nThis is their Bronzing Powder,\nand I'm in shade, Drawn In.\nI like to use this if I want\na little bit of that warmth,\nthat sunshine, looks like\nI've been out in the sun\nfor a little bit.\nI'm gonna use quite a bit on my forehead\nand a little bit more on the\nhigher points of my cheeks,\nkind of on top of the blush.\nI'm going to use my Jones Road Bronzing Brush.\nInstead of swiping, I'm\njust going to lightly dab\nto get that most natural look.\nAnd this bronzer is beautiful.\nIt's very pigmented, it's very soft,\nso don't go in and just start\nswiping your brush in there.\nBut the way it looks on the skin,\nit has a really beautiful airbrush finish,\nand it just works well with\nso many of my products.\nIf you're a one and done\ntype of an eyeshadow person,\nyou will love these if you\nhaven't tried them yet.\nThese are the RMS, the Eyelights.\nThey're a cream formula that\nhave a really beautiful,\nreally wet metallic finish.\nThey're not intense,\nbut the best part is how\neasy they are to apply.\nThey wear really well.\nThey honestly don't crease whatsoever.\nAnd I'm not going to\nwear an eyeshadow primer.\nI don't like actually\nwear an eyeshadow primer\nwith these Eyelights,\njust because they wear\nso well on their own.\nYou can apply these with your fingertip.\nOr if you want a little\nbit more precision,\njust use a brush, more of a\ndense, packing eyeshadow brush.\nSo I like the Rare Beauty Eyeshadow Brush\nbecause it also is supposed\nto mimic your fingertip.\nIt's nicely densely packed\nand it has like this angled,\nangled brush to it, angled tip.\nAnd I would say work one eye\nat a time to blend it out\nbecause once they set, they set.\nI'm gonna take the tip of the brush.\nAnd just kinda go a little bit\non the lower lash line.\nI don't want too much,\njust very, very softly.\nFor a best selling liquid eyeliner,\nit's by Ilia on Credo Beauty.\nAnd I'm gonna be honest with\nyou, it's not my favorite.\nI have still yet to find\na clean, liquid eyeliner\nthat works great.\nI like this one.\nI like it, obviously I'm\nfeaturing it in this video.\nI like it, but I don't love it.\nI find that you have to shake it a lot\nand you have to go over\nyour eyeliner multiple times\nto get it really black.\nWhen you swatch it,\nit's great, like it's black.\nBut I find that the brush,\nI'm not the biggest fan of.\nI wish it was more of a\nbrush instead of felt tip\nto get more precision.\nAnd it doesn't wear as long on me\ndepending on which type\nof eyeshadows I wear.\nSo I'm hoping, hoping this\none is going to vibe well\nwith the RMS.\nFor one of the best selling\nmascara on Credo Beauty,\nTower 28, Make Waves Mascara.\nThis is one of my favorites.\nWhen it first launched, I\ntried it, fell in love with it.\nI say it's basically if\nLancome, their Idole mascara,\nand Maybelline (laughing) Lash\nSensational, they had a baby.\nThis would be it.\nA clean version. (laughing)\nI like the wand, very easy to use.\nI would say it's a great\nall-around mascara,\nif you want the lift,\nthe curl, the volume,\nthe length, the definition.\nIt kind of gives you a\nlittle bit of everything.\nI would say it's not best\nfor just lifting or curling.\nI think it gives you a\nlittle bit of everything.\nI know that some people\ncomplain that it can flake\nor it can transfer.\nOn me, if I don't load it really heavy,\nit wears beautiful all day long.\nFor lips,\nthe best sellers.\nWe have a couple options.\nWell actually I'm gonna use both of them.\nThe first one is a lip\npencil by Ere Perez.\nI think that's how you\npronounce their brand name.\nThis is their Coco Crayon.\nSo it's essentially a\nlip pencil that they,\nyou can also use on your cheeks.\nIt's a full coverage natural lip crayon\nthat's supposed to give you\nmore of a matte lip color.\nI'm going to use the shade, Grace.\nThis type of pencil, it's\nvery creamy, it's very soft,\nvery easy to use.\nYou can't really be as precise\nas you would with the typical\nlip liner pencil, but you\ncan have some precision.\nBut I like to fill in my entire lip.\nAnd to make it even more comfortable,\nit is a comfortable pencil,\nit's comfortable enough,\nbut if you have really dry\nlips like I do right now,\nI'm going to top it with a liquid lip balm\nby Westman Atelier.\nThis, I've talked about this before and\nit's a beautiful,\nsplurge-worthy, treat-yourself\ntype of a lip balm product.\nThis is the Westman Atelier,\ntheir Squeaky Clean Lip Balm.\nIt's what they call a gel oil technology,\nwhere it gives you the beautiful shine,\nthe beautiful balmy finish and\nfeel without sticky texture.\nI just like wearing these on their own,\nor just simply outlining my lips,\nnot filling them all the way in,\nand just going with a\nlittle bit of lip balm.\nBut I like that they're\npacked, packed with oils.\nFor example, they have organic\njojoba, almond, argan oils.\nThey also have shea butter in here.\nAnd it just really nourishes your lips.\nAnd it's so easy to apply because it is a\nliquid lip balm version.\nAnd I just think it makes\nyour lips look so juicy.\nBut it makes your lips feel\namazing throughout the day.\nAnd there you have it,\na full face of some of the\nbest sellers from Credo Beauty.\nAnd a lot of these brands,\nI thoroughly enjoy as a\nwhole brand, in general.\nFor example, Westman Atelier,\nthey're very expensive,\nbut most of their products really deliver,\nand they wear up to the hype.\nAnother incredible brand is Tower 28.\nI really love their blushes,\nbut I wanted to show the Ilia multi-stick.\nBut their Tower 28 blushes are phenomenal.\nI also like to wear them on my lips.\nThey're pretty long-wearing,\nthey don't dry out my lips.\nAnd then of course, Kosas,\ntheir concealer is beautiful,\nvery creamy.\nIlia Beauty, we all know\nthem, we all love them.\nThey're a really beautiful\nall-around brand.\nRMS is another great one.\nBut just, Credo Beauty\nis a really great place\nif you're looking strictly for\nclean beauty, clean makeup.\nIt's all right there.\nI believe they have over 130\nbrands that are strictly clean,\nand just the entire brand,\nas a whole, is clean,\nand all of their makeup products\nfall into that category.\nBut I just wanted to\ndo a full face because\nI know a lot of people\nare, especially nowadays,\nthey're finding themselves,\nthey enjoy cleaner\nbeauty and cleaner makeup\nbecause they wanna know what\nthey're putting on their face.\nAnd I am so appreciative that\nmost of these makeup products,\nthey not only apply well, they\nlook beautiful on the skin,\nbut they also wear beautifully\nthroughout the day.\nI found that,\nyou know, when clean beauty\njust came on the market,\nit was really lacking in\npigment, blendability.\nBut clean brands, they're\nreally stepping up their game\nand their level is so high now that\nit's kind of hard to compete\nagainst a lot of these products.\nSo hope you guys found some inspiration.\nMaybe help you branch out a little bit\nto some of these different brands.\nBut I hope you guys enjoyed the video,\nspending time with me,\nand I'll see you in\nthe next one very soon.\nBye.",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

        "transcript_text": "hello beautiful welcome back to my channel\u00a0\nand welcome to this video where we are gonna\u00a0\u00a0\ndo a full face of makeup that should have been\u00a0\nviral makeup that is so underrated that might\u00a0\u00a0\nhave slipped under the radar a little bit for\u00a0\nvirality sometimes I get confused about what\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts become viral and which ones do not so\u00a0\nI'm just going to show you which things I think\u00a0\u00a0\nare totally underrated some old things some new\u00a0\nthings just doing a full face hopefully ending\u00a0\u00a0\nup with something pretty and if you haven't been\u00a0\nhere before do consider subscribing because I do\u00a0\u00a0\nupload quite a lot of videos every week and\u00a0\nI'd love to see you in my next one as well\nforeign this video is in collaboration with Chic\u00a0\ngeek I am super excited to be doing a video with\u00a0\u00a0\nher I am a new found subscriber at her Channel\u00a0\nI just recently found her she actually messaged\u00a0\u00a0\nme over at Instagram and asked me if I wanted\u00a0\nto do this full face of underrated makeup and\u00a0\u00a0\nI said oh I'd love to do like something that is\u00a0\nyou know makeup that should have been viral and\u00a0\u00a0\nwe planned this actually quite a time some time\u00a0\nago I'm usually a little bit busy a busy bee so\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm super grateful that she was able to be\u00a0\nso flexible about the time frame I usually\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel like it's so fun when people reach out and\u00a0\nthey have a really good idea of something that I\u00a0\u00a0\nwould like to do as long as I have time for\u00a0\nit because I don't always have time but she\u00a0\u00a0\njust does a lot of panning content and I think\u00a0\nshe's on a low buy or a no buy just watching a\u00a0\u00a0\nfew of her videos as of late so really check her\u00a0\nout if you want to have someone that's just you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow enjoying what they have so I would definitely\u00a0\nlink her down below don't forget to check her out\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'm super intrigued to see what she thinks in\u00a0\nher collection is like products that should have\u00a0\u00a0\nbeen viral underrated makeup and I'm gonna Zoom\u00a0\nUs in I'm gonna Zoom Us in and I'm just gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nstart at the bottom and work my way to eyeshadow\u00a0\nI have something that recently came back in stock\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I really love for eyeshadow and I cannot\u00a0\nwait to do another look with it and of course I\u00a0\u00a0\nwill link everything down in the description\u00a0\nbox if you're wondering about anything that\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm wearing where you can find it what shade I'm\u00a0\nwearing what did she really say because sometimes\u00a0\u00a0\nI'll be mumbling over here check the description\u00a0\nbox for more info and of course I'm going to be\u00a0\u00a0\nlinking to cheek geek over there as well okay\u00a0\nso the first thing I'm going to talk about is\u00a0\u00a0\nfoundation that I wore on my wedding I have been\u00a0\nloving this foundation for years and years and\u00a0\u00a0\nyears and I'm so surprised that the Giorgio Armani\u00a0\nNeo nude did not become more famous and viral than\u00a0\u00a0\nit is because this is a wonderful Foundation that\u00a0\nis I scrubbed my face yesterday do I feel like\u00a0\u00a0\nthis could be a good shade match for me because to\u00a0\nmatch my I think this is going to work out I love\u00a0\u00a0\nthis Foundation it is a medium coverage natural\u00a0\nfinish Foundation that lasts and lasts and lasts\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I said I wore this on my wedding day it just\u00a0\nlooks like your skin but in the best condition\u00a0\u00a0\never and I really really like the this foundation\u00a0\nand I love how it wears and I love how it looks I\u00a0\u00a0\nmean you can tell it still looks like my skin you\u00a0\ncan still see some things through so this is not a\u00a0\u00a0\nfull coverage foundation and I'm so surprised that\u00a0\nthis one did not become more High because it is so\u00a0\u00a0\nwonderful it comes in quite a few different shades\u00a0\nand it is available at Sephora if I'm not totally\u00a0\u00a0\nmistaken but yeah this is definitely a foundation\u00a0\nthat has I have two different shades and this one\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I'm wearing right now which is the shade I\u00a0\nuse the most because I do have a tan most of the\u00a0\u00a0\ntime like you can tell this looks just Immaculate\u00a0\nhonestly I'm almost out I almost use this\u00a0\u00a0\nFoundation up there is very little left and I'm\u00a0\njust more people should have loved this Foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nit's so cute for concealer I'm actually going to\u00a0\nbe using something that I recently discovered when\u00a0\u00a0\nI did a video trying out other Beauty creators\u00a0\nfavorites of the year and this is the Lys triple\u00a0\u00a0\nfix full coverage concealer I have not heard\u00a0\nenough people talk about this one and this has\u00a0\u00a0\nquickly become one of my favorite concealers\u00a0\nI've used it now for two weeks and honestly\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one is so good I really like the medium\u00a0\ncoverage that is it's very light in consistency\u00a0\u00a0\nit doesn't crease it doesn't cake it looks natural\u00a0\nand beautiful and really doesn't make your under\u00a0\u00a0\neyes look cakey or creepy and you don't need to\u00a0\nuse an excessive amount of powder to set it down\u00a0\u00a0\nbut it still doesn't crease throughout the day and\u00a0\njust makes your under eyes listen I'm 39 I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nneed anything that's like super heavy or like\u00a0\ncakey under my eyes it's gonna make me look like\u00a0\u00a0\na dinosaur like I don't want that so I think that\u00a0\nthis one is just super flattering on an under eye\u00a0\u00a0\nthat has a little bit of fine lines straight up\u00a0\nwrinkles let's be honest and I totally recommend\u00a0\u00a0\nthis concealer I think it's beautiful and I mean\u00a0\nit was mentioned by some people as yearly favorite\u00a0\u00a0\nbut this has not received a hype that I think\u00a0\nthat it deserves there are so many concealers\u00a0\u00a0\nout there that I hear people talking about\u00a0\ntheir absolute holy Grails and viral blah blah\u00a0\u00a0\nblah this one should have been this formulation\u00a0\nis perfection I'm gonna use a powder puff and\u00a0\u00a0\njust set down my concealer in a little bit in my\u00a0\nT-Zone this Powderpuff is from LH Cosmetics I've\u00a0\u00a0\nused this for so many years and I feel like powder\u00a0\nPuffs are starting to become a little popular now\u00a0\u00a0\nand yeah LH Cosmetics was on the ball years\u00a0\nago and this is a beautiful Powder Puff that\u00a0\u00a0\nhas like a little you know you put your finger in\u00a0\nI love that it's like a triangle this is a really\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful one and I really really do enjoy it\u00a0\nand I'm using the Covergirl powder this one was\u00a0\u00a0\nrecommended to me by tati and she's honestly super\u00a0\nlike correct about this being a great powder under\u00a0\u00a0\nthe eyes absolutely love it I will link that down\u00a0\nbelow as well let me do my brows I'm just going to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe using some brow product I don't know if I have\u00a0\nany suggestions about like great brow products\u00a0\u00a0\nthat wasn't viral because I feel like I'm if if\u00a0\nanything it would be that NYX brow pen this one\u00a0\u00a0\nthe lift and snatch I will link this down below\u00a0\nbut mine is actually out so I am going to be using\u00a0\u00a0\nthe nabla one instead I need to repurchase this\u00a0\none I thought I had a backup but I didn't rookie\u00a0\u00a0\nmistake this next product was actually mentioned\u00a0\nin my yearly favorites of last year and I will say\u00a0\u00a0\nfor all the hype that was around Korean bronzers\u00a0\nlast year I'm surprised that this wasn't more\u00a0\u00a0\nhyped this is the makeup Revolution cream bronzer\u00a0\nit is called the ultra cream bronzer and I have\u00a0\u00a0\nmine in medium I think this is a beautiful formula\u00a0\nthat is really beautiful to work with this one is\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit more on the neutral sides if you\u00a0\ndon't like a cream bronzer that's too warm this\u00a0\u00a0\nmight be for you and it's also really affordable\u00a0\nlike this is an affordable cream bronzer that is\u00a0\u00a0\nnot just good for the price look at that not\u00a0\njust good for the price actually actually a\u00a0\u00a0\ngood product and I think that sometimes when I\u00a0\nsee drugstore products being loved and I tried\u00a0\u00a0\nthem I sometimes feel like yeah this is good for\u00a0\nonly being three dollars so this is good for only\u00a0\u00a0\nbeing seven dollars but compared to other options\u00a0\nmaybe even for just ten dollars it is just not as\u00a0\u00a0\ngood and that's not how I feel about this cream\u00a0\nBrown I truly think that this is a great product\u00a0\u00a0\nand I think I use too much on the side hold\u00a0\nso I think that that looks absolutely stunning\u00a0\u00a0\nI think it's a beautiful product and I also am\u00a0\nsurprised I mean this is a this is a Indie product\u00a0\u00a0\nbut sometimes Indie products become really hyped\u00a0\nand I'm surprised that the glowy blushes by lethal\u00a0\u00a0\nCosmetics I'm going to use the orange one today\u00a0\nwasn't more hyped online because honestly this\u00a0\u00a0\nis a an amazing look at that this is an amazing\u00a0\nShimmer blush formula that is better than some\u00a0\u00a0\nhigh-end formulas and I really think that this\u00a0\nformula Disturbed a little bit more hype than it\u00a0\u00a0\ngot because it is pigmented and glowy and just so\u00a0\nbeautiful you can build it up you can Shear it out\u00a0\u00a0\nand I think that this product not only deserved a\u00a0\nlittle bit more hype overall but also in the Indie\u00a0\u00a0\nCommunity I don't feel like this formula\u00a0\ngot the hype that it deserved even in the\u00a0\u00a0\nIndie Community because this is a beautiful\u00a0\nblush formula and it comes in four different\u00a0\u00a0\nshades there is a red and orange a darker\u00a0\nmauve and a lighter cooler pink and they're\u00a0\u00a0\njust so beautiful and it's got this marbled\u00a0\neffect with the Shimmer in it and it's just\u00a0\u00a0\nit's just an awesome formula and you can buy\u00a0\na camera ready Cosmetics I will link that down\u00a0\u00a0\nbelow in case you're living in the US because\u00a0\nlethal Cosmetics is a German based Indie brand\u00a0\u00a0\nI want to use one of the lip crayons by house\u00a0\nLabs I know a lot of things are getting hyped\u00a0\u00a0\nby house left house Labs is a hype brand but this\u00a0\nis the product that I am using the most from the\u00a0\u00a0\nbrand and it is the lip crayons I have it in two\u00a0\ncolors this is I think Peach matte which is a nice\u00a0\u00a0\npeachy neutral I don't think I've been using this\u00a0\ncolor today I think I'll be using the color that\u00a0\u00a0\nI have been using the most which is current matte\u00a0\nwhich is a neutral like in neutral red a wearable\u00a0\u00a0\nRusty red this is a comfort mat but it's not\u00a0\noverly siliconey it is thin and Beautiful on the\u00a0\u00a0\nlips and it's just such a comfortable easy to wear\u00a0\neasy to apply wears beautifully just wonderful lip\u00a0\u00a0\ncrayon I really love it I hope they come out with\u00a0\neven more colors because some of them are a little\u00a0\u00a0\nwacky and I will say that I love wacky eye colors\u00a0\nbut I'm a little bit more timid when it comes to\u00a0\u00a0\nlip colors I really need to get a lip liner that's\u00a0\nlike a muted red I still have not been able to\nto get that do you see how beautiful that was um\u00a0\nI need a new lip liner I need to find a muted red\nI\nlove that let us do highlighter I'm actually going\u00a0\nto do highlighter that's just I feel flu under the\u00a0\u00a0\nradar I'm just gonna do a little professional\u00a0\nfirst this is the benefit um setting spray\nbefore we go in with the highlighter so this\u00a0\nhighlighter was released pretty much at the same\u00a0\u00a0\ntime as the rare Beauty highlighter and this is\u00a0\nthe new highlighter by Charlotte Tilbury this is\u00a0\u00a0\nthe face architect highlighter I have mine in\u00a0\nChampagne glow which is a beautiful color for\u00a0\u00a0\nme I am a light medium and this is perfect for\u00a0\nmy like coloring I think that this highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\nwas compared to the rare Beauty one and the rare\u00a0\nBeauty one is more metallic but I prefer this one\u00a0\u00a0\nI think that this one looks more believable\u00a0\nI do need a brush though hold I'm gonna do\u00a0\u00a0\na fluffy brush this is my old morphe 501 it's\u00a0\nstarting to look more and more like a broom it is\u00a0\u00a0\nnot living its best life but it's gonna have\u00a0\nto do I think that this is a very believable\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlighter it looks highlighty and it looks\u00a0\nglowy and you can definitely build this one\u00a0\u00a0\nup but it doesn't look as metallic and as\u00a0\nlike intense on the skin straight away as\u00a0\u00a0\nthe rare Beauty does and for that reason I can\u00a0\nsee why people prefer the rare Beauty one over\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one but I think that this one looks\u00a0\nlike a more believable wet look it is not\u00a0\u00a0\nas super intense straight out of the gate\u00a0\nlike you can like here just apply a little\u00a0\u00a0\nand just get it to look glowy oh my God this brush\u00a0\nis shedding get it to look glowy and believable\u00a0\u00a0\nwithout being straight up 2016 metallic stripe\u00a0\nI think it is absolutely stunning and I prefer\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one over there Beauty one I think the rare\u00a0\nBeauty one is great but I think this one is even\u00a0\u00a0\nbetter at least on me I think I prefer the look of\u00a0\nthis one it's just in mind you know a day-to-day\u00a0\u00a0\nlife and I will have is that Wednesday's video\u00a0\nI think is me doing like reviewing and ranking\u00a0\u00a0\nsome of my latest purchases I didn't do one in\u00a0\nJanuary because I was trying to you know take\u00a0\u00a0\nit a little chill in January so I'm having one now\u00a0\nand there's a bunch of products that are going to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe included in that video so don't forget to check\u00a0\nout Wednesday's video this one is very much in the\u00a0\u00a0\nupper part of that video I really enjoy it and I\u00a0\nrealized that it is an expensive highlighter but\u00a0\u00a0\nI think it looks expensive as well on the skin\u00a0\nI really really enjoy it I want to say sorry\u00a0\u00a0\nnot sorry I mean of course I sometimes wish that\u00a0\nI would really like this like expensive things\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I think that one is great now we're going\u00a0\nto talk about this okay where are we starting\u00a0\u00a0\nBH Cosmetics I love BHS metis quality I think they\u00a0\nreally did something around 2020 they really did\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething and they came back with the Vengeance\u00a0\nor maybe it was 2019 and they released a couple of\u00a0\u00a0\nthings and I mentioned BH Cosmetics as my favorite\u00a0\npalette in I think 2020 and also my favorite\u00a0\u00a0\npalette in 2021 and they released this collection\u00a0\nthat was called the say it collection but\u00a0\u00a0\nthis aesthetic wasn't policing the packaging\u00a0\nwasn't policing they have like words on the\u00a0\u00a0\npackaging that people weren't all about and me\u00a0\nneither I think they really should have done\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething else for this um this whole collection\u00a0\nbecause the quality of these Shadows this is the\u00a0\u00a0\nwarm toned yellowy orange red the quality of these\u00a0\nare the best quality that BH Cosmetics has ever\u00a0\u00a0\ndone I feel like this is the same quality as it\u00a0\nis in the passion in Paris which is a palette that\u00a0\u00a0\nI love all of these palettes amazing quality they\u00a0\nare like if if you didn't have this packaging and\u00a0\u00a0\nsomeone told you that this was like expensive\u00a0\nhigh-end eyeshadows you would believe them if\u00a0\u00a0\nsomeone told me this is a 45 palette I'd be like\u00a0\nthat seems about right these disappeared because\u00a0\u00a0\nBH Cosmetics went into chapter 11 bankruptcy and\u00a0\nthen they got bought out but these are back in\u00a0\u00a0\nstock now I will leave them down below because you\u00a0\ncan find these now and I'm super excited I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nusing this one today because I really wanted to\u00a0\ndo like a warm yellowy red moment but these are\u00a0\u00a0\nso so good I do have a video about these I will\u00a0\nlink that video down below if you want to see let\u00a0\u00a0\nme use a primer if you want to see how these all\u00a0\nSwatch and all behave because the collection the\u00a0\u00a0\nquality is amazing and this is what I'm hoping\u00a0\nthat BH Cosmetics will come back with because\u00a0\u00a0\nah I really like this collection and I do think\u00a0\nthat the main reason why it wasn't more hype\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause honestly palettes with less quality\u00a0\nthan this have been more hyped than this for\u00a0\u00a0\nthree times the price because these are affordable\u00a0\npallets is because of the packaging and because of\u00a0\u00a0\nthem having words on the front that weren't Maybe\u00a0\nthe best for all aspects of the beauty community\u00a0\u00a0\nand like they were having cuss words I mean I\u00a0\nguess they were trying to be edgy but honestly\u00a0\u00a0\nthey just came off as that Steve Buscemi meme\u00a0\nlike hello fellow kids like that's that's the\u00a0\u00a0\nenergy that this collection was giving Which\u00a0\nshame because the collection is so good and I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nreally hoping that they're able to produce\u00a0\nmore palettes with the same kind of energy\u00a0\u00a0\nbut different packaging not the\u00a0\nsame Palace of course but like oh\u00a0\u00a0\nthat would be my dream that is what I want them\u00a0\nto do so I'm just gonna be blending I think I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna start here and then just do a bunch of\u00a0\nthese maybe I'll do this one this one and this\u00a0\u00a0\none actually because it's a really dark honestly\u00a0\nI don't know I'm just going to be using a bunch of\u00a0\u00a0\nthese mattes but just know that I'm not using any\u00a0\nother palette but this one and it is just uh such\u00a0\u00a0\na beautiful palette and these colors really do\u00a0\nbuild And just pack a punch and I'm using them on\u00a0\u00a0\ntop of a non-set primer which is honestly my best\u00a0\ntip if you want to have super bright eye looks and\u00a0\u00a0\nif you're wondering why your eyeshadows are not\u00a0\nlooking maybe as saturated or as colorful as in\u00a0\u00a0\nsome like tutorials or pictures that you're seeing\u00a0\nit's probably because you're setting your primer\u00a0\u00a0\nor maybe because you are using a tooth flimsy\u00a0\nbrush those would be my two main reasons or\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe because you're doing this instead of first\u00a0\npacking on the color and then blending the edges\u00a0\u00a0\nthose are the main reasons why I would say that\u00a0\nmaybe your eyeshadow is not looking as bright\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause that is what I see people doing sometimes\u00a0\nthat complain about um pigmentation is that they\u00a0\u00a0\nwill do a super fluffy brush on a set primer and\u00a0\nthey will just swipe back and forth it's not going\u00a0\u00a0\nto give this result regardless of the quality of\u00a0\nthe eyeshadows but look at that yellow so gorgeous\nthe return of the squeaky chair I'm gonna use\u00a0\nthe orange half full now and I'm not gonna\u00a0\u00a0\npack this one on as much as I did the yellow\u00a0\nI'm just doing a light layer in the crease a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle bit lower than the yellow to get that\u00a0\ngradient effect before we go in with the red\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm just doing a little bit and just swiping\u00a0\nit on but you can tell it's pretty it's pretty\u00a0\u00a0\npigmented but keeping it a little lower just\u00a0\nso we can still see the yellow peeking through\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething like that and then I will be doing a\u00a0\nsmaller brush and I'll do I'll do this I'll do\u00a0\u00a0\nthe red Good Vibes only this is not the darkest\u00a0\nred it's the red tier this one I'll do this one\u00a0\u00a0\nand then we'll try and deepen it up with that\u00a0\none afterwards but I think I'm gonna use all the\u00a0\u00a0\ncolors look at that red look at that red mat ah so\u00a0\npretty some people say like oh I'm so annoyed with\u00a0\u00a0\nlike Beauty YouTubers being overly excited about\u00a0\nmakeup and doing the people call it the surprise\u00a0\u00a0\nPikachu face but honestly makeup is my passion\u00a0\nI love makeup there's a reason why my channel\u00a0\u00a0\non YouTube is about makeup and not something else\u00a0\nthere are a couple of areas in my life where I get\u00a0\u00a0\nextremely excited and makeup makes me excited when\u00a0\nI open a new palette and it looks beautiful I gasp\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's that's passion that's I like this and I\u00a0\nthink sometimes people don't understand that just\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause you are not maybe this passionate about\u00a0\nsomething it doesn't mean that others can't be\u00a0\u00a0\nand I get so excited about new makeup and just\u00a0\napplying new makeup and when it just goes on\u00a0\u00a0\npigmented and beautiful like this and I think\u00a0\nthat people forget that your experience is not\u00a0\u00a0\neveryone's experience another area where I get\u00a0\nsuper excited is of course gaming the way I've\u00a0\u00a0\nscreamed sometimes at some of the like when we\u00a0\nhave taken bosses that we have been trying to take\u00a0\u00a0\nfor such a long time like like literally screamed\u00a0\nor the way that I've giggled when my favorite\u00a0\u00a0\nauthor is coming out with the next book in a\u00a0\nseries that I'm loving to read like we all have\u00a0\u00a0\nlike areas where we get super super excited\u00a0\nand I will say if there is no area of your\u00a0\u00a0\nlife where you get super excited when something\u00a0\nabout anything maybe like try and discover what\u00a0\u00a0\nthat could be we all need a hobby that we're like\u00a0\nsuper excited about at least that one I think\u00a0\u00a0\nand if you don't agree that's perfectly fine but\u00a0\ndon't hit me in the comments please and thank you\u00a0\u00a0\nso I did some under my eyes as well and now I'm\u00a0\ngoing to be using the Silver Lining which is that\u00a0\u00a0\ndark red and I'm just gonna be adding a little\u00a0\nbit of that out here because I know from past\u00a0\u00a0\nexperience that this definitely is deep enough\u00a0\nand pigment enough for me to be an outer corner\u00a0\u00a0\nlike deepening shade I think that that looks\u00a0\nabsolutely stunning and then we can do some\u00a0\u00a0\nshimmers because I usually do some shimmers and\u00a0\nlooks but I really do love an all-math look and\u00a0\u00a0\nhonestly this one is yellow on the lid would be\u00a0\nbeautiful but I want to show you how beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nthe metallics are too also can we note that\u00a0\nthis is the fourth mat that I am layering on\nmost brands could never\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm gonna do both this orangey one and this\u00a0\none looks white but it actually is one of those\u00a0\u00a0\nlike white with the gold Sheen so it's like a dual\u00a0\nChrome topper so this orangey one it's called LOL\u00a0\u00a0\nand I love an orange I love orange I love all\u00a0\nkinds of eyeshadow but I love orange and I love\u00a0\u00a0\nan orange metallic and look at that I spray all my\u00a0\nshimmers to prevent and too much Fallout I still\u00a0\u00a0\ngot some because this is why I spray because I\u00a0\nalways put on too much Shimmer on my brush so\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is the white gold like duochrome topper shade\u00a0\nit's called happy camper and we're doing that on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe inner corner and just blending it into the\u00a0\nlid as well to get a little ombre effect going\u00a0\u00a0\nsuch a pretty shade I'm gonna do it a little bit\u00a0\nlayer on top here on the lower lash line because\u00a0\u00a0\nit is a Topper shade it will just transform a\u00a0\nlittle bit and that is the eye look it's that not\u00a0\u00a0\nincredibly stunning I love this palette I think\u00a0\nit is so pretty and this whole series was just\u00a0\u00a0\nit just flew under the radar and I just think the\u00a0\nmarketing for all of it was just bad and honestly\u00a0\u00a0\nBH cosmetic didn't send out any PR either so the\u00a0\npeople that needed to discover it and promote it\u00a0\u00a0\nI guess didn't because they were busy playing\u00a0\nwith the other makeup they got in PR but yeah\u00a0\u00a0\nthat whole collection it is available again and\u00a0\nit is stunning so here we are we are at the finish\u00a0\u00a0\nline and I think that everything looks incredible\u00a0\nI mean this is a full face of favorite makeup it\u00a0\u00a0\njust happens to be favorite makeup that I feel\u00a0\nlike more people should talk about just people\u00a0\u00a0\nsleep sometimes on really good makeup and\u00a0\nthat's the whole thing about going viral\u00a0\u00a0\nor about something being hyped up about just you\u00a0\nknow the marketing of makeup it's not always the\u00a0\u00a0\nbest makeup that sells the most and it's also I\u00a0\nmean a matter of preference I just recently did a\u00a0\u00a0\nvideo about like why some people might like some\u00a0\nproducts or why some people might hate the same\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct but I really do think that this is high\u00a0\nquality makeup that definitely deserve to get a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle bit more hype than they did don't forget to\u00a0\ncheck out the description box for more info about\u00a0\u00a0\nthese products and also of course to find cheat\u00a0\ngeek thank you so much for climbing with me and\u00a0\u00a0\nthank you so much for giving me this video idea\u00a0\nbecause I really loved going through my collection\u00a0\u00a0\nand finding some stuff that I would like to talk\u00a0\nmore about don't forget to subscribe before you\u00a0\u00a0\nleave and I will see you again well I think I'm\u00a0\ngonna see you again on Wednesday for my rankings\u00a0\u00a0\nvideo it's going to be quite a bunch of products\u00a0\nso don't forget to check that one out as well bye\nthank you [Applause]

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

        "transcript_text": "hey guys so for today's video we are doing my\u00a0\nvery first shop my stash slash refreshing my\u00a0\u00a0\neveryday makeup drawer series I guess I'm really\u00a0\nexcited to do this video today I've actually been\u00a0\u00a0\nlike looking forward to filming this and doing\u00a0\nthis with you guys I love watching these videos\u00a0\u00a0\nso I hope that you do too it's just so fun to see\u00a0\nwhat is in people's collection and what products\u00a0\u00a0\nare they reaching for so as you know this year I'm\u00a0\nfinally focusing on using the makeup products in\u00a0\u00a0\nmy collection and one of the reasons why I think I\u00a0\nwasn't using the products that I have is because I\u00a0\u00a0\ndidn't have any kind of system in place to rotate\u00a0\nthrough my products and use the things that I\u00a0\u00a0\nalready have so I would keep like my favorite\u00a0\nthings in my desk right in front of me and all\u00a0\u00a0\nthe new products I get but I would never reach\u00a0\nfor all of the stuff behind me in these drawers\u00a0\u00a0\nso to put some kind of system in place for me I'm\u00a0\ngoing to be doing a monthly refreshing my everyday\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup drawer and I'm going to walk you through\u00a0\nthat entire process today so in these videos I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to show you the products that I've been\u00a0\nusing for the past four weeks or so and then\u00a0\u00a0\nwe're gonna put them back into my collection and\u00a0\ngrab some new ones to try for the next month and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen I'll do a little tutorial with those products\u00a0\nI really like the way that Sarah Rose does these\u00a0\u00a0\nvideos so this format is inspired by her I really\u00a0\nthink that this system is gonna work for me and\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm super excited about this so if you guys want\u00a0\nto do something like this I hope you try it too\u00a0\u00a0\nso I already kind of did like my first rotation\u00a0\nof products off camera just because I wanted to\u00a0\u00a0\nlike ease myself into it without filming so I'm\u00a0\ngoing to show you what I've been using also my\u00a0\u00a0\nnew drawer organization because I'm super excited\u00a0\nabout it I feel like I have finally mastered my\u00a0\u00a0\ndrawer organizing all right so I'm gonna show\u00a0\nyou my drawers my new organizing what I've been\u00a0\u00a0\nusing and then we'll pick out some new products\u00a0\nso one thing I've made a point to do is to keep\u00a0\u00a0\nless makeup on top of my desk like this used to\u00a0\nbe full of like lipsticks and a bunch of other\u00a0\u00a0\n[\u00a0__\u00a0] now I just have like my palettes my new\u00a0\nstuff right there in my brushes and I just love\u00a0\u00a0\nhow simple this looks okay let me quickly talk\u00a0\nabout these organizers because I'm just obsessed\u00a0\u00a0\nwith them so these are all from Amazon I had\u00a0\ndrawer organizers before but they were all just\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of like mismatched so I just wanted like a\u00a0\ncomplete collection and that looks nice and clean\u00a0\u00a0\nand what I love about these they have little\u00a0\nrubber stoppers on the bottom so they're not\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to slide in these drawers because in these\u00a0\nIkea drawers stuff will slide around so easily so\u00a0\u00a0\nI love that they don't move and this just looks\u00a0\nso nice and clean to me I love it and one thing\u00a0\u00a0\nI've been trying to do too is to not like Stack\u00a0\nUp products on top of each other I really want to\u00a0\u00a0\nmake sure I have everything laid out flat so I can\u00a0\nactually see what is in my drawers so just quickly\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing over my organizing here these three little\u00a0\ncontainers are all my project pan items so they're\u00a0\u00a0\nright in front of my face I know exactly where\u00a0\nthey are and those live right here they do not\u00a0\u00a0\nmove you've already seen all these items I'll link\u00a0\nthat video down below if you want to see it so I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nnot going to talk about these and then the rest of\u00a0\nthe products in here are products that like live\u00a0\u00a0\npermanently in my collection so my powders my RC\u00a0\nMay powder my elf powder my acosis powders it's\u00a0\u00a0\nright here are my mascaras I have like my say\u00a0\nprimer my setting sprays my Sigma lip mask like\u00a0\u00a0\nthese live here permanently I have some liners\u00a0\nright here that I just always reach for so this\u00a0\u00a0\nstore is Project pan and permanent stuff that I\u00a0\nuse like every single day can we see me I think so\u00a0\u00a0\nokay then this drawer looks amazing I wish I had\u00a0\na before picture to show you because this drawer\u00a0\u00a0\nwas like all over the place but this looks perfect\u00a0\nto me now this drawer is all of my stuff I've been\u00a0\u00a0\nusing recently stuff that I will rotate throughout\u00a0\nmy collection so these are all of my shop my stash\u00a0\u00a0\nitems I've been using for the past four weeks\u00a0\nor so and I have all my lashes right here and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen I need like tools over here okay so let's\u00a0\nquickly go over these products that I've been\u00a0\u00a0\nusing for the past four weeks so first I have the\u00a0\nrare Beauty Foundation I've just been wanting to\u00a0\u00a0\ntry this more and really figure out my opinion on\u00a0\nit and honestly I don't have much feelings about\u00a0\u00a0\nthis Foundation like it doesn't look terrible on\u00a0\nmy skin but it also doesn't look amazing it just\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of like lives right in the middle for me so\u00a0\nI'm excited to grab something else I've also been\u00a0\u00a0\nusing the Dior forever skin correct concealer and\u00a0\nI've been loving this for spot concealing my face\u00a0\u00a0\nyou guys know I really like my Nars soft matte\u00a0\nconcealer for that but this has been working great\u00a0\u00a0\nfor that too it really is a good full coverage\u00a0\nconcealer I've also been using the rare Beauty\u00a0\u00a0\npore filling primer and I literally just found\u00a0\nout the other day that they have two primers\u00a0\u00a0\nI thought they only had one primer and I thought\u00a0\nthis was it but they also have an Illuminating one\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich I would actually prefer over this I think I\u00a0\nbought this when it came out I really don't know\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I honestly don't love poor filling primers I\u00a0\nprefer more of a hydrating Illuminating one so I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink it looks nice I like the texture of it but\u00a0\nit doesn't really do much for me I've been trying\u00a0\u00a0\nto get some more use out of my Charlotte Tilbury\u00a0\nHollywood Flawless filter I kind of use this more\u00a0\u00a0\nas like a little bit of a liquid highlight if I\u00a0\nwant even more of a cream highlight I like this\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct but I think I have another one I want\u00a0\nto try next is the Merit beauty cream bronzer\u00a0\u00a0\nstick I honestly don't think I like this I try\u00a0\nto use this a couple times and it just doesn't\u00a0\u00a0\ndo much for me the color is pretty pale and I just\u00a0\nthink it's too balmy for me and I kind of feel the\u00a0\u00a0\nsame way about this with their cream blushes like\u00a0\nthey're just too sheer for me so I honestly don't\u00a0\u00a0\nthink I like this I might end up decluttering\u00a0\nwearing this at some point and that's kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe point of these videos is to actually use my\u00a0\nproducts and figure out do I want to keep this\u00a0\u00a0\nin my collection probably not next is the make up\u00a0\nmy Mario skin enhancer look at this pan guys oh my\u00a0\u00a0\ngosh I hit pan on this like earlier this month\u00a0\nand I was so dang excited I told my boyfriend\u00a0\u00a0\nI was like oh my gosh I hit pan I clearly love\u00a0\nthis cream bronzer I love the texture the color\u00a0\u00a0\nlike everything about this is amazing so I have\u00a0\nlike a New Found Love for this and then I've been\u00a0\u00a0\ntrying to use this Tower 28 Cream Blush in Power\u00a0\nHour this was living in my downstairs bathroom\u00a0\u00a0\nfor a while so I wanted to bring it up here I\u00a0\nonly used it a few times I just don't think I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nreally into this color right now so I'm excited\u00a0\nto grab something else now and then I have a\u00a0\u00a0\ncouple lip products here I bought this Tower 28\u00a0\nlip gloss what is the shade oh pistachio about\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a month or two ago and this is just such\u00a0\na beautiful pink color watch this for you like\u00a0\u00a0\nI really like the texture of these lip glosses\u00a0\nit is so pretty I also have the tarte maracuja\u00a0\u00a0\njuicy Lip Cream in a soft rose right here I'm\u00a0\nso obsessed with these juicy lip creams like all\u00a0\u00a0\nversions of these I really love and this is the\u00a0\nmaracuja juicy lit plump in Rose I don't really\u00a0\u00a0\nremember putting both of these into my drawer\u00a0\nbut these are both rows so pretty I love these\u00a0\u00a0\nand then I've also been trying to use my Natasha\u00a0\ndenona lip pencil in Natasha and again it's such\u00a0\u00a0\na pretty creamy pinky lip liner I've really been\u00a0\nliking this and then moving over here for my loose\u00a0\u00a0\npowder I've been using this Sigma soft focus and\u00a0\nvanilla bean and I have really been liking this I\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of just use this to set like around my nose\u00a0\nand kind of where I have larger pores and I think\u00a0\u00a0\nit does a great job I've actually used a lot of\u00a0\nthis this used to be like overflowing with powder\u00a0\u00a0\nbut now it's kind of minimal I will be grabbing a\u00a0\ndifferent loose powder for this round of products\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I'm happy to know that I truly do like this\u00a0\none I've also really been enjoying the makeup by\u00a0\u00a0\nMario skin perfector and I've been using it more\u00a0\nas a powder bronzer and I think it does a great\u00a0\u00a0\njob I've really been liking this and then for a\u00a0\nlight press powder I've been using this for Urban\u00a0\u00a0\nDecay stay naked the fix in 20 CP I actually use\u00a0\nthis a lot in my eyeshadow looks when I need like\u00a0\u00a0\na skin tone colored Shadow or powder to blend so\u00a0\nthat's what I kind of use this for I also use it\u00a0\u00a0\nto kind of lighten up my face in any area since\u00a0\nit is kind of lighter than my skin tone and then\u00a0\u00a0\nI did have this Kat Von D blush and Fox Glove in\u00a0\nhere but honestly I think I only used it like once\u00a0\u00a0\num I'm just like not feeling this color right\u00a0\nnow but I do like this formula then lastly I\u00a0\u00a0\nhave the ball foam will powder a blush quad I have\u00a0\nonly been using this shade out of the blush quad\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I don't really have anything like this\u00a0\nso I kind of wish I knew how I felt about these\u00a0\u00a0\nShades but I just honestly never reached for\u00a0\nthose all right so let's put all these products\u00a0\u00a0\nback in my collection and grab some new ones all\u00a0\nright let's start with foundations I put back my\u00a0\u00a0\nrare Beauty one I have my other hydromaniac in my\u00a0\nproject pan right now I think I'm gonna pull out\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer the oil free\u00a0\nformula I honestly don't know if I like this one\u00a0\u00a0\nor not which is why I'm gonna put it in my shop\u00a0\nmy stash this is the shade 2w1 which I'm not sure\u00a0\u00a0\nif it's too light or too dark for me so I'm also\u00a0\ngoing to pull out my Fenty Beauty ease drops to\u00a0\u00a0\nmix with that whether I need to make it lighter\u00a0\nor darker I also in pale today so I will need a\u00a0\u00a0\nlighter shade for concealers I did also just buy\u00a0\nthe Urban Decay quickie one so I am using that one\u00a0\u00a0\nquite a bit I think I want to grab up my Sephora\u00a0\nbest skin ever and kind of see how that compares\u00a0\u00a0\nto the quickie um and obviously not compare them\u00a0\ntoday but this is like my favorite concealer right\u00a0\u00a0\nnow so I'm gonna bring this one back in So for\u00a0\nbronzer like I said I was loving the makeup by\u00a0\u00a0\nMario one so I think I want to try out this house\u00a0\nLabs one again I get I'm still trying to figure\u00a0\u00a0\nout how I feel about this bronzer so let's add\u00a0\nthis one in I do have my powder highlighters\u00a0\u00a0\nback here I'm still trying to figure out where\u00a0\nI want to put these in my collection so I'm not\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to touch any of those right now because I\u00a0\nam using my rare Beauty ones okay this drawer is\u00a0\u00a0\na little messier than I thought I'm gonna pull\u00a0\nout the elf Halo glow I need to get more use\u00a0\u00a0\nout of this and really finalize my thoughts on\u00a0\nthis one I feel like that's kind of the theme\u00a0\u00a0\nof this to shop my sash like do I really like\u00a0\nthis product let's find out okay then I said I\u00a0\u00a0\nwas loving the sigma loose powder so I'm gonna\u00a0\ngrab out a different loose powder I'm gonna go\u00a0\u00a0\nfor this hourglass one I've had this for a while\u00a0\nin my collection so I want to try this one out\u00a0\u00a0\nand then for a light pressed powder I'm gonna go\u00a0\nback to my Charlotte Tilbury shade number one I\u00a0\u00a0\nlove this powder now this Shores eyeliners eye\u00a0\nprimers I don't really like grab for this stuff\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe for funsies we should grab one of these\u00a0\nKasha Stacks sorry the lights purple you have\u00a0\u00a0\nmy background light on right now I'm gonna pull\u00a0\nout this one in the shade velvet dream and then\u00a0\u00a0\nthis Trio is all matte so maybe let's grab this\u00a0\nUrban Decay Munda shadow in Space Cowboy I feel\u00a0\u00a0\nlike everyone's using this right now so I want\u00a0\nto too oh yes my favorite drawer all of my cream\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts let's go oh well I am using I'm actually\u00a0\nnot gonna pull out any cream bronzer because I\u00a0\u00a0\nam still using the makeup Revolution one I just\u00a0\nbought and I've been loving this one and I also\u00a0\u00a0\nhave the elf luminous putty bronzer that I'm still\u00a0\nusing so I'm not gonna pick out anything from here\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I'm gonna use these all right but for\u00a0\nCream Blush I think I want to grab this Milani\u00a0\u00a0\none again this is pretty new to my collection this\u00a0\nis the shade nude kiss it's so pretty and then I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nalso going to pull out a liquid highlighter this\u00a0\nis the rare Beauty wand the shade is enlightened\u00a0\u00a0\nso I do have the powder version of this as well\u00a0\nbut I need to get some more use out of this I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to pop this into my shot my stash all\u00a0\nright we have made it down to powder blushes\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm actually gonna grab one of the sigma ones\u00a0\nand specifically one that I haven't used a lot of\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I really need to see which of these I like\u00a0\nI like purple light so you can see these Shades\u00a0\u00a0\nbetter and okay hopefully that's better okay this\u00a0\nis nearly wild I've used Tiger Lily quite a bit so\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm not going to pick that one so I want to pick\u00a0\nsomething that's newish to me this is berry love\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's kind of pretty this is Cordy Rosa I've used\u00a0\nthat many many times this is bronze star kind of a\u00a0\u00a0\ndeeper one and sunset kiss kind of more of like a\u00a0\npeachy Coral I think I'm gonna go with this Berry\u00a0\u00a0\nlove one and this one is an all matte blush okay\u00a0\nwhich like sit on the floor and talk really quick\u00a0\u00a0\nignore my like pile of garbage right there so I\u00a0\ndidn't grab any eyeshadow palettes because I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nstruggling with a system for eyeshadow palettes\u00a0\nbecause I have so freaking money and I keep all\u00a0\u00a0\nof like my current ones in this cabinet honestly\u00a0\na lot of the time I'm just not in the mood to play\u00a0\u00a0\nwith eye shadow I'd rather just slap on like a\u00a0\nquick Shimmer a little brown in my crease and\u00a0\u00a0\ncall it good because that's what I really like\u00a0\nto wear on a daily basis I'm not always playing\u00a0\u00a0\nwith color like you guys might think I do and I\u00a0\ndon't really want to like force myself to do my\u00a0\u00a0\neyeshadow if I'm not in the mood to do it what\u00a0\nI have been doing is that I keep the Natasha\u00a0\u00a0\ndenona my dream palette on my table with me at all\u00a0\ntimes and this isn't like a pan that palette kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof thing but if I want to grab some eyeshadows I\u00a0\nknow I love I grab for this palette but I guess\u00a0\u00a0\nthis kind of has been like my go-to palette it's\u00a0\njust easy for me to use I love all the shades in\u00a0\u00a0\nhere and if I do want to play with some colors I\u00a0\nhave some options in here to do that with but this\u00a0\u00a0\nalso makes me kind of sad because I also feel like\u00a0\nI'm not getting use out of my eyeshadow collection\u00a0\u00a0\nso if you have any like recommendations for that\u00a0\nlet me know I know some people do like a deck of\u00a0\u00a0\npalettes they'll like pick a card or like pick a\u00a0\npopsicle stick with which palette to use but that\u00a0\u00a0\njust doesn't excite me and that feels like I'd\u00a0\nbe forcing myself to use it so hmm I don't know\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me know if you have any thoughts on that\u00a0\nall right let's dive into these products that\u00a0\u00a0\nI picked out and do a little face of makeup I did\u00a0\njust quickly do my brows off camera and I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\ngo in with the elf Halo glow liquid filter first\u00a0\nof all this product is so dark this is the shade\u00a0\u00a0\ntoo are you serious and that's why I'm trying to\u00a0\nuse it and test it out today and see how I really\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel about this I don't know what I'm doing\u00a0\nI'm just gonna draw this on kind of as if I\u00a0\u00a0\nwas using like my say glowy super gel and let's\u00a0\njust pop this in I guess [Music] thank you [Music]\nso I definitely think that made my skin like\u00a0\nglowier for sure and it definitely Blends\u00a0\u00a0\nout to be not that dark but the thing I like\u00a0\nabout the say one is that like when I rub it\u00a0\u00a0\non I can like feel the hydration and I feel like\u00a0\nI don't feel it with this it's a lot of feelings\u00a0\u00a0\num also my lips are feeling dry so I'm gonna pop\u00a0\non my lip mask all right then for foundation I\u00a0\u00a0\npicked out the Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer\u00a0\nlet me check the shade really quick I'm also gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nshake this up this product is really full\u00a0\nI really haven't used much of it so it's a\u00a0\u00a0\nshade 2 W1 that might be a little dark but\u00a0\nI'm gonna make it work I think with this\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna try a brush for applying it so I'm\u00a0\nusing my Sigma F 76 and what I've been doing\u00a0\u00a0\neven like with my Urban Decay hydromaniac is\u00a0\nI like sloppily apply it with the brush and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen use my sponge to really set it into\u00a0\nmy skin yeah this is a little dark for\u00a0\u00a0\nme I did just scrub off my tan but it's\u00a0\nfine I'm not really going anywhere today\nI'm just gonna like bring that down my\u00a0\nneck and then go back in with my sponge\n[Music]\nI feel like my skin on camera is looking better\u00a0\nthan it does in person right now let me get a\u00a0\u00a0\nmirror and really look at it here I mean it looks\u00a0\nfine I'm not like blown away or anything I do\u00a0\u00a0\nneed to spot conceal so I'm gonna use my Nars soft\u00a0\nmatte concealer this is in my project pan [Music]\u00a0\u00a0\nand then while that's sitting on my face I\u00a0\nwill use my Sigma under eye color corrector\nI'm gonna spray my face with\u00a0\nmy rare Beauty mist and then\u00a0\u00a0\nPat in that Nars concealer with my Sigma f 64.\n[Music]\nokay now I'm going to try out that\u00a0\nrare Beauty liquid highlighter before\u00a0\u00a0\nI do my other cream products so\u00a0\nagain the shade is enlightened\nI like the shape of this applicator a lot foreign\nokay that actually looks really pretty on top of\u00a0\nthat Tinted Moisturizer do you see that glow I\u00a0\u00a0\nlike that right now for cream bronzer I'm gonna\u00a0\ntake the makeup Revolution one in light [Music]\u00a0\u00a0\nit's so weird to me how this bronzer\u00a0\nhas like a fruity smell to it\u00a0\u00a0\nnot what I would expect from a\u00a0\ncream bronzer you know [Music]\nthank you foreign\nwith the brush first and then just smooth\u00a0\nover everything with my sponge and then\u00a0\u00a0\nfor cream blush I'm going to use the\u00a0\nMilani nude kiss blush that I picked out\nthis is such a pretty color such a good\u00a0\nlike just everyday blush color I love this\n[Music]\nnow for under eye concealer I'm going to use my\u00a0\nSephora collection best skin ever I'm excited\u00a0\u00a0\nto be using this one again because I do love\u00a0\nthis one I'm gonna let this sit under my eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nfor just a second and I am going to use The\u00a0\nHourglass translucent powder to set it which\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm really nervous about because I talked about\u00a0\nthis in the recent video but I feel like some\u00a0\u00a0\ntranslucent powders aren't really translucent like\u00a0\nthey kind of change the color of your concealer or\u00a0\u00a0\nFoundation or whatever so I'm gonna try this under\u00a0\nmy eyes with the concealer and we'll see if this\u00a0\u00a0\nchanges the color or anything I'm nervous like\u00a0\nthis powder could make or break the whole look\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm going to blend out that concealer I'm\u00a0\nalso just going to bring it onto my eyelid\n[Music]\nand then before I set anything I will add just a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle more blush kind of where\u00a0\nit got Blended away right here\nall right hourglass let's do this also just\u00a0\nrandom I don't love the shape of this because\u00a0\u00a0\nI like to use the lid of my loose powder to\u00a0\nlike work the powder into my brush you can't\u00a0\u00a0\nreally do that with this interesting shape in\u00a0\nhere okay I'm going to take my F35 and because\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna try to swirl it in here this is what I\u00a0\nnormally do with my elf powder with my rcma one\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna go in go in\u00a0\neverything's fine don't panic\n[Music]\u00a0\u00a0\nI think we're good we are safe to use under\u00a0\nthe eyes with a pale concealer I still feel\u00a0\u00a0\nlike though it's not like fully set like\u00a0\nI can still see like the glowiness of the\u00a0\u00a0\nconcealer which I'm not mad about I kind\u00a0\nof want to try the other eye with my elf\u00a0\u00a0\nHalo glow because I've just been obsessed\u00a0\nwith this I'm gonna do that let's see let's\u00a0\u00a0\nif there's a difference so these videos are\u00a0\nfor right for funsies right using my elf powder\nstraight up can you see how like this side\u00a0\nstill looks glowy but this side doesn't which\u00a0\u00a0\nis interesting because it is called the elf Halo\u00a0\nglow powder but does it really have a glow to it\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm not surprised but I do prefer how the elf side\u00a0\nlooks I'm gonna try to add a little bit more of\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Hourglass maybe because I feel like it didn't\u00a0\nlike fully set right in this area it's not much\u00a0\u00a0\nof a difference like you probably can't tell on\u00a0\ncamera but that's what that looks like sometimes\u00a0\u00a0\nyou just gotta test your powders for science now\u00a0\nI'm setting my face with the acosis cloud set\u00a0\u00a0\npowder this powder lives permanently in my makeup\u00a0\ndrawers I'm honestly pretty happy with how my\u00a0\u00a0\nskin looks right now which I'm kind of surprised\u00a0\nbecause I thought I didn't like that Laura Mercier\u00a0\u00a0\nmoisturizer but I think it looks pretty good all\u00a0\nright now let's go in with the house Labs velvet\u00a0\u00a0\nbronzer and light two I want to do a quick Swatch\u00a0\nof this really quick oh it really does feel smooth\u00a0\u00a0\nit honestly feels velvety that's a very nice\u00a0\ntexture okay I think this will work and I am\u00a0\u00a0\npale today so perfect I'm gonna use my Sigma\u00a0\nF12 I'm going to start on my forehead actually\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel like it's always safer to start on\u00a0\nyour forehead than your cheekbones to\u00a0\u00a0\nlike see what the color looks like this is the\u00a0\nonly house lab product I have from their like\u00a0\u00a0\nwhole new launch at Sephora like I don't\u00a0\nhave the foundation or anything this is it\ncolor is it's nice\nwe'll bring some of this down my neck\u00a0\nthough just to blend a little bit all\u00a0\u00a0\nright now for blush I picked out the sigma blush\u00a0\u00a0\nin Berry love very pretty matte color\u00a0\nlet's do a little Swatch of this too\u00a0\u00a0\noh I think that'll be a nice little pinky shade\u00a0\nso I'm gonna use that same brush I was just using\n[Music]\nvery pigmented but I actually\u00a0\nreally like this color\nI think for a while I was just scared to use\u00a0\nthis blush because it looks really dark in the\u00a0\u00a0\npan doesn't it the other day I was wearing a new\u00a0\nfoundation and I asked my boyfriend I was like\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat do you think of my foundation and he's like\u00a0\nI can't tell because you're wearing so much blush\u00a0\u00a0\nall over your face and I was like damn will you\u00a0\nattack me like that I like this blush color cute I\u00a0\u00a0\nam going to kind of blend around my blush a little\u00a0\nbit though so I'm gonna use my hourglass ambient\u00a0\u00a0\nlighting Trio for this this is another product\u00a0\nthat lives permanently in my collection so I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to take this shade right here on another F35\u00a0\nand this I'm using around the edges of my blush\u00a0\u00a0\njust to soften it like under my eye right here\u00a0\nit's also going to give a little bit of a glow to\u00a0\u00a0\nthis blush since it is a matte blush okay I know I\u00a0\ndid pick out a new highlighter but I've been using\u00a0\u00a0\nthis Sigma one in Twilight that's kind of a fun\u00a0\nlike pinky shade and I think this will look good\u00a0\u00a0\nwith the berry love blush so I'm going to take\u00a0\na little bit of this right here on my cheek I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of going on like the top of my cheek right\u00a0\nhere like the point of the apple of my cheek if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou will just because this has like a little bit\u00a0\nof a pink tint to it I think it's kind of pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nlike that and then I will just Pat over with my\u00a0\nsponge all right let's do a quick eye look with\u00a0\u00a0\nthese products I picked out so I didn't really\u00a0\nPrime my eyes but I do have some concealer on\u00a0\u00a0\nmy eyelid so I'm just going to call that good\u00a0\njust because I'm not doing like a crazy super\u00a0\u00a0\ncolorful look or anything I'm just using like\u00a0\nmatte shadows so again this Trio is called velvet\u00a0\u00a0\ndream I'm actually gonna take this top shade on a\u00a0\nsigma e35 and I'm just gonna run that across like\u00a0\u00a0\nmy entire eyelid and in my crease kind of sloppily\u00a0\nthis is like a skin tone colored eyeshadow so this\u00a0\u00a0\nis kind of Perfect Since I didn't really Prime\u00a0\nmy eyes it is showing up a little bit on my skin\nforeign\nshade on the same brush and I am going to be a\u00a0\nlittle more precise with this shade in my crease\u00a0\u00a0\nwell it kind of has like a little bit of a pink\u00a0\nsalmony undertone to it and then I'm also lightly\u00a0\u00a0\npacking that on the outer part of my lid blending\u00a0\nit into my crease this is kind of what I do for an\u00a0\u00a0\neveryday eyeshadow look I just use like one fluffy\u00a0\nbrush and I can do a whole look with this I also\u00a0\u00a0\nuse my bronzer for this step a lot too if I don't\u00a0\nfeel like going into a palette or anything foreign\nI like that shade in the crease a lot I like the\u00a0\npink undertone in it now I'm going to take that\u00a0\u00a0\nUrban Decay a space cowboy Moon dust Shadow and\u00a0\nthat's gonna go like all over my inner lid this\u00a0\u00a0\nis such a fun eyeshadow that you can wear with\u00a0\nlike literally any look if you just want to add\u00a0\u00a0\nany kind of Sparkle to it it's so gorgeous these\u00a0\nMunda Shadows are beautiful I only own this one\u00a0\u00a0\nas much as I would want more shades I just know\u00a0\nthat I don't really grab for single Shadows a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nhow pretty is this didn't they used to have like a\u00a0\nmoon dust palette I should bring that back I'd buy\u00a0\u00a0\nthat going back to my e35 and just softly blending\u00a0\nin the crease [Music] I'm gonna switch to a sigma\u00a0\u00a0\nE30 and take more of that Medium tone shade\u00a0\njust kind of run that across my lower lash line\n[Music]\u00a0\u00a0\nand then I'm gonna take a little\u00a0\nbit of this Deeper Shade and just\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of smudge that along the\u00a0\nouter part of my top lash line\nthe shade is like very very warm and then\u00a0\nwe'll bring a little bit right out here why not\n[Music]\nI'm gonna take that Sigma highlighter\u00a0\nand pop that in my inner corner\nall right here is my super simple eyeshadow look\u00a0\nI'm gonna go pop on some mascara all right I just\u00a0\u00a0\npopped on some mascara on my top lashes I'm\u00a0\nwearing the Lawless mascara I haven't used\u00a0\u00a0\nthis much so I wanted to use it today see how I\u00a0\nfeel about it I feel like it looks really good I\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel like the bristles were nice and like grippy\u00a0\nso I realized I didn't pick out any lip products\u00a0\u00a0\nI honestly just kind of forgot but I am working\u00a0\non a separate video right now where I am trying\u00a0\u00a0\non every single lip product I own just to see the\u00a0\ncolors on and actually decide if I want to keep it\u00a0\u00a0\nor not so that will be coming probably in the next\u00a0\nfew weeks or so but for my lips today I did just\u00a0\u00a0\npop on my Charlotte Tilbury iconic nude lip liner\u00a0\nit's in my project pan and then I only popped on\u00a0\u00a0\nthis makeup Revolution lip oil I just purchased\u00a0\nit's the glaze lip oil with cherry seed oil and I\u00a0\u00a0\ndidn't realize it had cherry seed oil in it and I\u00a0\njust don't really love the smell of cherry it does\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel very good and just juicy and like smoothing\u00a0\non the lips so I like that all right then this is\u00a0\u00a0\nmy full face using my new shop my stash items\u00a0\nfor the next four weeks I'm really excited to\u00a0\u00a0\ncontinue to use these products and really form my\u00a0\nopinions on them like that hourglass powder kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof shocked me today even the Laura Mercier Tinted\u00a0\nMoisturizer so check back in in four weeks and I\u00a0\u00a0\nwill give you my thoughts and opinions all the\u00a0\nproducts I use today because I will continue to\u00a0\u00a0\nuse them over the next month or so I really hope\u00a0\nyou guys enjoyed this style of video from me so\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me know your thoughts thank you so much for\u00a0\nwatching and don't forget to like And subscribe",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I fell for it too many times. <br><br>I\u2019ve heard a few Youtubers talk about products that they want to try but they wouldn\u2019t purchase and immediately turn around and ask the brand to send them it as PR. I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on. It just makes me look at them differently.**",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I fell for it too many times. <br><br>I\u2019ve heard a few Youtubers talk about products that they want to try but they wouldn\u2019t purchase and immediately turn around and ask the brand to send them it as PR. I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on. It just makes me look at them differently.**",

for.\nAnd it just sucked that the first\nproduct that I tried...\nit didn't work out.\nSo, they were kind enough to send\nbasically all of their product range\nat the time, I think.\nOther than the \"Great Barrier Relief\"\nand the body one.\nSo, this one is a very unique formula.\nIt is a one-of-a-kind\n\"jelly to oil\" cleanser.\nso it does come out as a jelly,\nbut I did notice that if you do leave it\nstanding for a while,\nit can kind of liquify\nmore into an oil.\nSo, I do recommend kind of like\nshaking it up every now and then\nto make sure it does\nstay that jelly formula.\nAnd, boy, does it feel amazing\non the skin.\nIt does have such a silky texture about it,\nthat feels just wonderful\nas your massaging it on the skin.\nAnd it emulsifies like an absolute dream.\nYou know sometimes when\nyou emulsify cleansers,\nthey either go like way too watery\nor kind of clump up and\nget kind of gluggy.\nIt just...ahh...it just\nfeels like wonderful,\nand it washes off super,\nsuper easily as well.\nI know they have marketed it\nto remove waterproof makeup\nand I'm not going to say it doesn't.\nBecause, if you do work at it,\nit will remove the waterproof makeup.\nBut I did personally find that\nit does take quite awhile\nand you do have to rub at\nyour eyes for awhile.\nNow the type of waterproof mascaras I wear\nare like really seriously waterproof,\ncause I use a lot of\nJapanese waterproof mascaras.\nWhich, like literally, barely\nanything takes it off.\nI use my mascara removers, like the\n\"Heroine Make\" one.\nSo, I would still prefer to use\nsomething like that\nand then use this\nfor the rest of my face.\nThe main oil ingredients are Grape Seed,\nas well as Sunflower Seed Oil.\nAnd it does also include Vitamin E\nfor those antioxidant benefits.\nIt definitely has been a hit for me.\nAnd it certainly makes that\ncleansing process really fun\nand something to look forward to.\nI also just noticed I have like mostly\ntoner and essence products today.\nI mean you guys know that\nI love toners and essences,\nbut, literally, 4 out of the 6 products\nare like a toner or essence.\nFirst I have the:\nWhenever I bring up essences,\nI feel like someone always\nmentions the MISSHA one.\nWhich like, totally understandable.\nThey are quite iconic and\nknown for their essence.\nI actually had tried their\nTime Revolution Essence in the past,\nbut, honestly, it was\nprobably like 4 to 5 years ago,\nand they have changed the formula since.\nSo it was my first time trying\nthis renewed one out.\nI understand that Essences are definitely\nnot something that is necessary.\nAnd I feel like a lot of people are totally\nfine with not using Essences.\nAnd that is totally fine.\nBut for me, I feel like\nEssences are a product\nthat is something that you don't\nreally feel like is working\nwhen you're using it,\nbut as soon as you stop using it\nyou do realise the benefits\nthat it does have\nfor the hydration of your skin.\nIt really can be that first step\nin your skincare routine,\nso all of your other products\nwill work better.\nAnd it does also help to\neven out skin texture\nand skin tone over time as well.\nI do like to use this type of Essence,\nwhich is a really really water,\nlight Essence\nas my first step after cleansing.\nAnd this one is quite similar\nto the Neogen one,\nwhich I have mentioned multiple times as\nessentially my Holy Grail Essence.\nThey both use Bifida as the main\nfermented ingredient\nalong with Niacinamide.\nI would say the Neogen is\nslightly more hydrating,\nbut this one does feel fresher on the skin.\nSo if you do want the\nbenefits of an Essence,\nbut you don't like layering\ntoo many heavy layers,\nyou might actually like this one.\nIt is 150ml for about $40,\nlike at retail price.\nSo, you could definitely\nfind it for cheaper.\nAnd yeah,\nI feel like it is very comparable,\nI mean even from its ingredients,\nto the Neogen.\nSo, if one of them is easier for you\nto get your hands on,\nI'd recommend either of them\nas your first ever Essence.\nSo, yes, it has been a \"Hit\".\nAnother great fermented ingredient,\nI do have the:\nSo, this product actually contains\n94% of Galactomyces\nand 4% Niacinamide.\nMan...Niacinamide is really in everything\nthese days, isn't it?\nI feel like it is like the new\nHyaluronic Acid.\nHyaluronic Acid was in\nabsolutely everything\nand then we started to try like avoid it,\nbecause it's in absolutely everything.\nAnd then some people can get like\nirritated from too much Hyaluronic Acid.\nI feel like the same thing is\nhappening with Niacinamide.\nI feel like some people are\ndefinitely looking for\nNiacinamide-free products these days.\nUnfortunately, this is not one of them.\nFor me, the biggest issue with this product\nwas actually its packaging.\nThis bottle leads me to believe that it is\na Serum or Ampoule type product.\nBut as you can see, it is actually like\nsuper duper watery.\nIt is just water, ya know*?\n(*Aussie for you know)\nIt is like super lightweight.\nIt's actually more like the MISSHA Essence.\nSo, it actually confuses me to how much\nof the product I need to use\nand if I do need to use like\na palmful of this product,\nlike I would an Essence,\nI feel like it is not\ngreat value for money,\nbecause it is only a 50ml bottle.\nVersus the COSRX Galactomyces Essence,\nwhich I just recently started using,\nso I haven't included it\nin this month's \"Hits & Misses\".\nBut that one is like 150 or 180ml.\nAnd the two main ingredients, the first\ntwo ingredients, are the exact same.\nIt is way more affordable than this one.\nIt is a way bigger bottle\nwith the same ingredients.\nAnd it actually has more of a\nviscous texture,\nso it has a bit more of a slip.\nSo, with that one, I know that\nI can use it more as a Toner\nor a Serum step.\nWhereas this one, with the bottle\nand the texture and everything\nI get so confused to like when\nin my routine that I should use it\nthat I just end up not reaching for it.\nHence, I did open it a while ago,\nbut I had barely used it,\nbecause I just end up\nreaching for my bigger Essences like this.\nUnfortunately, it has been a \"Miss\" for me.\nI don't actually think it is a bad product,\nbut, especially for a skincare beginner,\nI feel like it is just confusing.\nSpeaking of COSRX,\nI actually have their:\nSo, typically with \"Hits & Misses\"\nI do include products\nwithin a month of use,\nso they're usually like just lightly used.\nBut look at this...like...\nI am almost empty.\nThis was the main Toner\nI was using in the US\nand funnily enough it was\nbrand new to me at the time,\nbut I was like,\n\"I just need a full-size Toner.\"\nI feel like this is like\na good all rounder.\nSo I took it with me to the US\nand other than this Toner,\nI only had like minis that\nI had brought with me.\nAnd...OMG...\nI absolutely LOVED it!\nAlthough we were in the US during winter,\nwe did stay in Florida.\nSo, it was mainly warm days\nwith medium humidity.\nAnd there was some cold days\nin there as well.\nThis one was great,\nbecause it did deeply hydrate,\nbut it didn't feel overly greasy.\nAnd it really did leave my skin looking\nplump, supple, and added that\nglow as well.\nIt does include 72% of Propolis Extract,\nwhich is antibacterial and\nanti-inflammatory,\nwhile having healing properties.\nAnd adds moisture and radiance\nto your skin as well.\nSo it can actually work for\npretty much all skin types,\neven acne-prone skin.\nIf you do feel like it is a\nlittle bit too hydrating\nwhen you have oily or acne-prone skin,\nyou can actually put it on a cotton pad\nand just swipe across your face.\nSo you can get those benefits,\nwithout it being like\noverly hydrating on your skin.\nI actually did do this as well in Florida,\nbecause the water there is\nnot quite as soft or nice\nas water in Melbourne.\nAnd I didn't want to break out\nfrom the water,\nso I actually, after I washed my face,\nI would put someone on a cotton pad,\nswipe it off\nand then, since I do have a bit drier skin,\nI applied an extra amount in my palms\nand then patted it in.\nAnd my skin was literally like:\n*prrrummm*\n(plumping sound)\nIt stayed so good for\nthe whole month I was there\nand this was like essentially\nthe only Toner I was using.\nSo, obviously it was an absolute \"Hit\".\nAnd although it is still\nthe start of the year,\nI think it's already made my list of\ntop Toners of this year.\nNext, I do have the:\nSo some of you guys may have seen\nthe Reel that I did with Logan\nfollowing his skin care routine\non Instagram with iUNIK.\nI think a lot of you guys liked it.\nAnd it was honestly\nso much fun to film as well.\nWe were just cackling the whole time.\nBut, he has been using iUNIK\nfor probably close to a month now\nAnd after we filmed that video,\nI was like, \"It's done now, so you can\nswitch back to your other products.\"\nBut he was like,\n\"Ah, nah...like...I like them.\"\nAnd he has continued to use them,\neven though we don't need\nto be trialling them for\nthe video anymore.\nSo, yeah, he has 100% enjoyed\nthe products from iUNIK.\nAnd so many of you guys\nactually DM'd me saying like,\n\"OMG!! It's such a good brand.\"\n\"Great value for money.\"\n\"It's really affordable,\nbut it is really high quality products.\"\nAnd I was like, \"I totally agree.\"\nSo do we want a\nfull brand review of iUNIK??\nPlease let me know in the comments.\nAnd, although I didn't use as many of\nthe products in-depth as Logan,\nthis Toner seriously surprised me.\nTypically, I don't like products that are\nmore aimed at acne-prone or troubled skin.\nAnd I don't really like them to contain\na lot of Tea Tree either,\nbecause of that strong smell.\nAnd this one does actually include\n67% of Tea Tree Leaf Water.\nThat's probably why.\nIt's not like concentrated Tea Tree,\nit's the Leaf Water.\nAs well as 19% of\nCentella Asiatica Leaf Water.\nThe smell that I was worried about is\nreally, really subtle and quite refreshing.\nAnd the formula is actually super watery,\nbut it hydrates like crazy!\nWhich is what surprised me.\nI just didn't expect it to\nbe that hydrating,\nbecause it is very watery\nand also for more troubled skin.\nBut even if I put it on a\ncotton pad and swipe,\nit is still hydrating enough for my skin.\nSo if you have acne-prone skin or\noily skin that is dehydrated,\nI feel like you would\nabsolutely love this one.\nIt is a generous 200ml of product\nand sells for about $20,\nso obviously very affordable.\nAnd I actually do have an Amazon code\nuntil the end of February.\nI don't know if I'm supposed\nto say it in this video,\nbecause it's not sponsored or anything.\nIt was for the Reel and I'm\nsure you guys can use it.\nSo, I will leave the code and everything.\nIf you do want 20% off iUNIK on\nAmazon US right now, as well.\nObviously, it has been a \"Hit\"\nfor both myself and Logan.\nOkay, the last product I have is\nactually a Japanese product.\nAnd it is the:\nI feel like one of the reasons\nto why Japanese skincare\ndo as well as K-Beauty overseas\nis this super confusing,\ndoesn't make sense naming of products.\nIt's like, \"What's the brand name??\"\n\"What's the product name??\"\nBut, this sheet mask has seriously\nbeen making its mark in Japan.\nSo I actually got this from a friend that\nvisited towards the end of last year.\nAnd she brought it for me as a gift.\nAnd she was like,\n\"This is so popular in Japan right now.\"\n\"You have to try it!\"\nAnd I have mentioned it\na couple times on IG,\nbut I cannot find links to it anywhere.\nLike no one online sells it.\nSo, it is like a Japan only\nexclusive product.\nSo when you visit Japan,\nmake sure you get this one.\nAnd even when I last checked @cosme,\nit was still ranked as #1 in the\ncategory of sheet masks.\nSo obviously the popularity is continuing.\nSo, for me, this sheet mask is kind of\nlike a more affordable multipack\nof the numbuzin No. 3 sheet mask.\nCause that one's individually wrapped,\nper mask.\nIt's kind of expensive.\nBut this one, it has seven masks\nfor 770 Japanese yen.\nWith the current exchange rate,\nit's about 85 US cents per mask.\nSo, super, super affordable.\nThe only thing is, you really can only\nget it in Japan at the moment.\nSo this one is not something that\nI would use every single day,\nbecause it is quite rich in its essence,\nbut something that I would\nuse on special occasions\nor when I need that extra boost\nfor my skin the next day.\nThe masks are absolutely drenched in\nessence that contains Niacinamide,\nas well as four derivatives of Vitamin C.\nAnd it's supposed to help with pore care,\nbrightening, elasticity, and glow.\nAnd it definitely does give that\ninstant glow after I've used it.\nAlso, there is so much extra\nessence in this pouch.\nWhen my friend gave it to me she was like,\n\"After you've used up the sheet mask,\nthere is so much Essence in there,\nso make sure you put your own\nsheet mask or cotton in there\nand you can get like an extra\ntwo masks out of it.\"\nI would definitely recommend it more\nto Normal and Drier skin types,\nsince it is quite rich\nand it does contain some\nEssential Oils as well, just as an FYI.\nBut yeah, obviously it has been a \"Hit\"\nand I'll be grabbing myself\nsome more in March\nwhen I'm back in Japan.\nIM SO EXCITED!!\nWell, I really do hope you\nguys enjoyed the first\n\"Hits & Misses\" of 2023\nHow exciting!\nIf you do want to check\nany of my past ones,\nI have selected a couple here\nfor you guys to check out.\nAnd make sure you Subscribe,\nso you can see\nmy upcoming \"Hits & Misses\" as well...\nI promise you...\nyou won't regret it ;)\nAnd yeah, I'll see you guys\nin the next video.\nBye!! *muah*",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

I fell for it too many times. <br><br>I\u2019ve heard a few Youtubers talk about products that they want to try but they wouldn\u2019t purchase and immediately turn around and ask the brand to send them it as PR. I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on. It just makes me look at them differently.**",

        "transcript_text": "foreign\n[Music] hi guys it's Christy and welcome back to\u00a0\nmy channel so I've created two different eye looks\u00a0\u00a0\nas you can see using the Huda Beauty Love Fest\u00a0\npalette and these are the looks that I've created\nso if you want to see how I created these two\u00a0\nlooks then stay tuned and keep on watching\n[Music]\nthank you so this is what the packaging looks\u00a0\nlike it is a small compact packaging it has a\u00a0\u00a0\nclear plastic covering around it and if you go to\u00a0\nthe back it has all the ingredients as well as a\u00a0\u00a0\n24 month shelf life which is actually great when\u00a0\nit comes to pellets so I'm really really excited\u00a0\u00a0\nabout that so let's go ahead and unbox it so this\u00a0\nis the actual casing it is a quite small compact\u00a0\u00a0\ncasing as you can see and then it has a bit of\u00a0\nholographic effect going on here on the front\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich is pretty cool it's purple in color again\u00a0\nat the back it has the 24 month shelf flat that it\u00a0\u00a0\nstates and then also I do like the fact that Huda\u00a0\nStates all of her social tags on all her palettes\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich is pretty smart of her so let's go ahead\u00a0\nand open this so it does have a compact mirror\u00a0\u00a0\non the side and then it has nine eyeshadows as\u00a0\nyou can see so it has six mattes which is good\u00a0\u00a0\nfor transition Shades it's got a metallic marble\u00a0\nshade here and then if you look here on the middle\u00a0\u00a0\nand on the side here it has two crushed flake\u00a0\nShades so this palette is actually made in China\u00a0\u00a0\nI know her smaller palettes are made in China\u00a0\nher bigger palettes are made in Italy so we're\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna just see how the textures are we're gonna\u00a0\ngo ahead and do a quick swatch for you guys and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen a tutorial as well and then I will give you\u00a0\nmy final thoughts on this palette okay so we're\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna go ahead and Swatch these shades for you\u00a0\nso I'm starting with the first three on the top\u00a0\u00a0\nand as I'm rubbing my fingers into these I\u00a0\ncan feel that the mats do feel very buttery\u00a0\u00a0\nthe metallic marble here feels a little powdery so\u00a0\nlet's go ahead and just Swatch that on my hand and\nso that's more like a dark brown\u00a0\nor slightly on the plum side\nand then we've got like a burnt orange\u00a0\nhere and then the metallic marble\nokay I don't see it looking\u00a0\nvery metallic going in with this\u00a0\u00a0\nLight peach the first crushed\u00a0\nflake does feel very flaky\u00a0\u00a0\nand powdery at the same time again the maths feel\u00a0\nvery very battery let's go ahead and Swatch these\nas you can see that's on the peachy side\nokay so this is the first crushed like look\u00a0\nat that that's super pigmented it does have\u00a0\u00a0\na very high gloss finish to it and then\u00a0\nwe've got like another orange which seems\u00a0\u00a0\nvery similar to the shade here going in\u00a0\nwith the second crushed flake and the mats\nSwatch these\nokay\nsome matte and the other mat\nso from these Shades as you can see it's six\u00a0\nmattes and then we've got the metallic and the\u00a0\u00a0\ntwo crushed flakes what I've noticed though and\u00a0\nI'm gonna compare this to the empowered palette\u00a0\u00a0\nthe crushed flakes is not as flaky um and that's\u00a0\nactually a good thing because normally if you are\u00a0\u00a0\ndoing your eyeshadow you can have a lot of Fallout\u00a0\nso um we are obviously only going to be able to\u00a0\u00a0\ntell when I do my eye looks to see if there is\u00a0\nenough Fallout or if it's minimal Fallout but\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom swatching it I can tell that it doesn't have\u00a0\nmuch flakiness going on which is actually quite\u00a0\u00a0\nnice the mats are quite buttery so I can tell\u00a0\nthat they're going to blend with ease I'm gonna go\u00a0\u00a0\nahead and do two different eye looks on either eye\u00a0\nand we'll give our final thoughts of this palette\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen I'm done so first I use an eyeshadow base\u00a0\nthis is the P Louise in shade ruma3 and I passed\u00a0\u00a0\nthat all over my lid I now take the light peach\u00a0\nand work that into my crease using a blending\u00a0\u00a0\nbrush then I'm going in with the darker orange\u00a0\nagain using a fluffy brush and just blending\u00a0\u00a0\nthat into my crease and now picking up the\u00a0\ndarkest orange and applying that into my crease\u00a0\u00a0\nnow picking up some of this dark brown or Plum\u00a0\ncolor and just applying that to my edge of my\u00a0\u00a0\neye and using a blending brush to just blend\u00a0\nthat through so there's no harsh lines and then\u00a0\u00a0\npicking up my blending brush that I use with\u00a0\nthe orange color and just working that into my\u00a0\u00a0\ncrease now taking the LA Go Pro sitting spray\u00a0\nand applying that to my brush and picking up\u00a0\u00a0\nthis metallic shade and applying that all over\u00a0\nmy lid now picking up the crush flake using my\u00a0\u00a0\nfinger and applying that all over my lid going\u00a0\nin with the transition shade and just working\u00a0\u00a0\nthat into my crease so that everything is\u00a0\nBlended out evenly and now picking up the\u00a0\u00a0\ndarkest orange with a blending brush and just\u00a0\nworking that into my bottom lash line and then\u00a0\u00a0\nusing a smudge brush picking up the darker brown\u00a0\nand just applying that to my bottom lash line\u00a0\u00a0\nand now smoking it out with a blending brush and\u00a0\nnow picking up the crushed flake with the smudge\u00a0\u00a0\nbrush and just applying that to my inner corner\u00a0\nand this is what the first eye look looks like\u00a0\u00a0\nnow going in with the second eye look picking up\u00a0\nthis brown and patting it all over my eyelid then\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing in with the darker brown using a blending\u00a0\nbrush and just patting that all over my lid and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen slowly working that into my crease picking\u00a0\nup this peachy shade and just working it into my\u00a0\u00a0\ncrease as a transition shade to blend out all\u00a0\nof that evenly then going in with this crushed\u00a0\u00a0\nflake with my finger and applying it all over\u00a0\nmy lid as you can see there's minimal Fallout\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich is great now using a smudge brush to pick\u00a0\nup more product so that everything is evened out\u00a0\u00a0\nalong my crease line and now picking up the\u00a0\ndark brown with the smudge brush and working\u00a0\u00a0\nthat into my lower lash line and then picking up\u00a0\nthis Peach shade using a blending brush and just\u00a0\u00a0\nsmoking that lower lash line out and finally just\u00a0\npopping on some of that Crush flake on my inner\u00a0\u00a0\ncorner and now I'm going to complete the rest\u00a0\nof my look and I'll be back with the final look\u00a0\u00a0\nso my final thoughts on the Huda Beauty love this\u00a0\npalette so let's start with the pigments I did\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel the really rich in color so I love that about\u00a0\nthis palette and then when it came to the mattes\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're really buttery so it was very easy to\u00a0\nblend and use as transition Shades and then with\u00a0\u00a0\nthe metallic Shimmer so I didn't feel it was as\u00a0\nshimmery as I would have liked it to be in fact\u00a0\u00a0\nI had to go in with this crushed flake Shadow\u00a0\nhere to go over the actual color to intensified\u00a0\u00a0\nand give it the Shimmer that it needed um with the\u00a0\ncrush Flex I really liked the fact that it didn't\u00a0\u00a0\nhave as much Fallout as I was expecting it to have\u00a0\nso when it comes to the price of this palette it's\u00a0\u00a0\nusually priced around 29 US Dollars and in South\u00a0\nAfrica it's around just over 500 rounds in fact I\u00a0\u00a0\npurchased mine on Black Friday from The Arc store\u00a0\nso I was able to get this at half price and that\u00a0\u00a0\nwas a huge win for me um overall though this\u00a0\npalette is quite Compact and travel size as you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan see uh pigments are really great but if you're\u00a0\nlooking for more versatility then I wouldn't\u00a0\u00a0\nsuggest this palette as I would think that the\u00a0\nshades are very very similar other than that it\u00a0\u00a0\nreally is a very nice palette and I mean it's not\u00a0\nas badly priced considering the brand so I would\u00a0\u00a0\nreally recommend this palette it really is a good\u00a0\nbuy so guys I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and\u00a0\u00a0\nreview and I hope that the tutorial was made as\u00a0\nbeginner friendly as possible for you and I can't\u00a0\u00a0\ndecide which eye look I prefer better I'm gonna\u00a0\nleave that to you so again these are the different\u00a0\u00a0\neye

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

She lies about the false lashes and then didn&#39;t respond about it at all and she hid the sponsored statement and doubled down on her lies and made a joke out of her actions in subsequent videos. She has used filters too.  She has yet to apologize and she shouldn&#39;t be given the benefit of the doubt at all. That ship sailed.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on.

        "transcript_text": "hi guys welcome to my Channel today I have a\u00a0\nvery unique and special video I will be testing\u00a0\u00a0\nREM Beauty eyeliner versus rare Beauty eyeliner by\u00a0\nSelena Gomez and obviously rem beauty by Ariana Grande\u00a0\u00a0\nso let's put these bad boys on test and see how\u00a0\nare they and which one is the winner let's start\u00a0\u00a0\nso starting up with the eyeliner from rem Beauty\u00a0\nwhich is called at the borderline eyeliner marker\u00a0\u00a0\nin the shade midnight black this is long wearing\u00a0\nout of this world eyeliner marker that stands the\u00a0\u00a0\ntest of time waterproof smudge proof LifeProof\u00a0\nso let's see how this guy is this one retails\u00a0\u00a0\nat selfridges for 18 quid and I don't think the\u00a0\nprice is too bad the packaging is matte white and\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's a bit of a risky move because usually\u00a0\nthis tends to get really filthy this is how\u00a0\u00a0\nit looks like it has little filter tip there's no\u00a0\nbrush anything like let's see how it's on the skin\nokay I think we can work with this\u00a0\nis very black I tried to wipe this\u00a0\u00a0\nand it's not going anywhere like\u00a0\nthat's actually impressing I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nhave any setting spray whatsoever like\u00a0\nlook at this guys I can't take it off\nFirst Impressions I like the formula it's easy\u00a0\nto apply but we have a problem the felted tip gets\u00a0\u00a0\nreally bendy like let me show you like I hope\u00a0\nyou can see but the tip gets really bendy and\u00a0\u00a0\nit's really difficult to work with this so I'm\u00a0\nnot a big fan of this applicator I think if it\u00a0\u00a0\nwas all the type of applicator that could be\u00a0\nso much more better because the ink itself\u00a0\u00a0\nit's amazing but it's very very difficult to do\u00a0\nany precise lines when the tip gets so bended so\u00a0\u00a0\nI think I'll give this one maybe a 6 out of ten\u00a0\nI'm not sure this is gonna enter into my favorite\u00a0\u00a0\neyeliners but let's try the rare Beauty one and\u00a0\nsee how that one performs the next one is from\u00a0\u00a0\nrare Beauty and it came in this cute packaging\u00a0\nit was actually a Christmas gift and it has like\u00a0\u00a0\na mascara and an eyeliner so let's see this guy oh\u00a0\nmy look at this that's very interesting I love the\u00a0\u00a0\npackaging like this gives me kkw Beauty Vibes so\u00a0\nlet's open this one I must say this one takes my\u00a0\u00a0\nheart I love the packaging so much like I'm much\u00a0\nmore of a fan of this one even though it seems to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe white again maybe creamy sort of thing I like\u00a0\nthis one much more than rem so and it feels much\u00a0\u00a0\nmore heavier like this gives me quality Vibes\u00a0\nlike straight away the difference is unreal\nokay it's very black as well well obviously\u00a0\nwhat would I expect and let's see if it smudges\u00a0\u00a0\nwow that's unreal look at this this is the\u00a0\none from rare beauty and I'm trying to smudge\u00a0\u00a0\nit and yeah it's literally the same like the\u00a0\nother ones so they both get bonus points for\u00a0\u00a0\nthis forgot to mention this one is called perfect\u00a0\nStrokes matte liquid liner now let's put it on the\u00a0\u00a0\ntest this one and see how easy is to apply and\u00a0\nhow different is from the REM Beauty one oh wow\nthis one is so easy to apply\u00a0\nlike straight away you could\u00a0\u00a0\ntell that I have some solid stuff in my hands\nI am so happy with the rare Beauty eyeliner\u00a0\nlike the difference is absolutely unreal it\u00a0\u00a0\nwas so easy to apply and it's so sturdy and just\u00a0\nvery very good compared to the other one the other\u00a0\u00a0\none feels like something you would get from Shein\u00a0\nif I'm honest and even the applicator like look\u00a0\u00a0\nat this even if it's kind of the same like the\u00a0\nrem it's so nice like it didn't bend whatsoever\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it still as perfect as it was before using\u00a0\nand the rare Beauty one retails at space NK for\u00a0\u00a0\n20 quid and I think that's a little bit\u00a0\nmuch for an eyeliner but considering how\u00a0\u00a0\ngood it is compared to the rem one it definitely\u00a0\nworth all the money I'm sorry arianators but\u00a0\u00a0\nI feel like we have a winner here the winner is\u00a0\ndefinitely the rare Beauty one like if you could\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel this one and this one in your hands the\u00a0\ndifference is absolutely insane this feels very\u00a0\u00a0\nvery cheap very thin very light like it feels as I\u00a0\nsay like something from Shein well this one feels\u00a0\u00a0\nlike top quality high-end eyeliner so this one\u00a0\ndefinitely gets like a 10 out of 10 for me I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna use it and I'm very happy with this one a\u00a0\nlittle bit more pricey but definitely worth all\u00a0\u00a0\nyour money and this one I think you can skip it\u00a0\ndefinitely there are so much more good eyeliners\u00a0\u00a0\nlike drugstore ones that I've tried compared to\u00a0\nthis one it's definitely not worth 18 quid so I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink you can save your money add a little bit\nmore and get the rare Beauty one because it's\u00a0\u00a0\namazing while doing my eyeliner with the rare\u00a0\nBeauty one I wanted just to open this one and\u00a0\u00a0\nshow you that it already started to leek right\u00a0\nhere so imagine what's going to be like after a\u00a0\u00a0\nweek or so I didn't do anything like I just closed\u00a0\nit with the lid and look how dirty it got inside\u00a0\u00a0\nimagine later this one wins bonus points\u00a0\nagain because it's all black right here\u00a0\u00a0\nso at least here you're safe from any filthiness\nso I hope you enjoyed this video if you did\u00a0\u00a0\nplease give it a big thumbs up to subscribe\u00a0\nfor more of my videos and until next time bye",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I fell for it too many times. <br><br>I\u2019ve heard a few Youtubers talk about products that they want to try but they wouldn\u2019t purchase and immediately turn around and ask the brand to send them it as PR. I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on. It just makes me look at them differently.**",

again\u00a0\nI am going to be highlighting a black owned brand\u00a0\u00a0\nas we are still in the month of February and in\u00a0\nthe US the month of February is a black history\u00a0\u00a0\nmonth so I have quite a few items from the\u00a0\nbrand lyf and I will be showcasing those items\u00a0\u00a0\nspecifically I once again will be filtering other\u00a0\nproducts that I just I need to filter in because\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't have a full full face of Lys but I will\u00a0\nbe showcasing every last item that I currently\u00a0\u00a0\nown from the brand and just so that you guys\u00a0\ncan see of course this is the finished look on\u00a0\u00a0\nmy face so if you are interested in seeing how\u00a0\nI created this full face let's just get to it\nhey guys so I am so excited today to do another\u00a0\nfull face I do have all of my skincare on but\u00a0\u00a0\nthat has been chilling on my face for over eight\u00a0\nhours and now my face is ready to get some of\u00a0\u00a0\nthis makeup on so I already created my little\u00a0\nbasket of items that I'm going to be using I'm\u00a0\u00a0\npretty sure today I was like I planned I planned\u00a0\nso I already have all of the Lys items and other\u00a0\u00a0\nitems that I need to just create a full face in\u00a0\nmy basket so hopefully less Clips back and forth\u00a0\u00a0\nwill be done for me which is good because if\u00a0\nyou are an editor you know it's just easier so\u00a0\u00a0\nfirst things first we're going to go ahead and\u00a0\ngo in with the Lys secure skin gripping primer\u00a0\u00a0\nand this does have some niacinamide it has\u00a0\nfive percent niacinamide so I don't know if\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna mention this at the intro but I do\u00a0\njust want to go ahead and mention it now for\u00a0\u00a0\nfull disclosure I am a ambassador of Lys so\u00a0\nbasically what that means is that they like\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't really know how to say it but basically\u00a0\nI am somebody who like can get points through\u00a0\u00a0\nlike this system because I showcase their brand\u00a0\nnow I have absolutely no idea if like this video\u00a0\u00a0\ncan like be used towards that point system I\u00a0\ntruly don't care I wanted to be an ambassador\u00a0\u00a0\njust because I thought it would be nice to be\u00a0\nAmbassador with a brand that I truly like their\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts that said I don't know if that is a thing\u00a0\nso I just wanted to be full disclosure on that\u00a0\u00a0\num and they haven't sent me anything right they\u00a0\nhaven't sent me anything all of the items that I\u00a0\u00a0\nphysically have in my collection are items that\u00a0\nI spent my money on and I picked up now when it\u00a0\u00a0\ncomes to this gripping primer what I will say\u00a0\nis that this is one of the best Alternatives in\u00a0\u00a0\nmy opinion to the milk makeup gripping primer\u00a0\nnow it's not as gripping so you need to kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof have that element if this is too gripping\u00a0\nfor you maybe try the Lys but I feel like it\u00a0\u00a0\njust melts into my skin like it's already seeped\u00a0\ninto my skin it is still a tad bit gripping but\u00a0\u00a0\nit's not nearly as gripping as the herb as the\u00a0\nmilk makeup it also has a little bit more of a\u00a0\u00a0\nserum type finish so it's definitely more runny\u00a0\non your hands than the milk so if you don't like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe more gel finish or formulation that the milk\u00a0\nmakeup is I definitely would say try out the Lys\u00a0\u00a0\num and I don't think I finished my thought process\u00a0\nso basically this video is not sponsored it's not\u00a0\u00a0\nbeing pushed for any one reason I did a poll on\u00a0\nmy community tab a couple of weeks ago now and\u00a0\u00a0\nyou guys said that one of the brands you wanted\u00a0\nme to Showcase this month is quite literally\u00a0\u00a0\nL by S there are a couple of more full faces\u00a0\nthat I plan to do this month if I can push it\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm trying to get up two more full faces before\u00a0\nthe end of the month so we'll see how good I do\u00a0\u00a0\num I just unfortunately last week was very hectic\u00a0\nand I just was not prepared for how hectic and how\u00a0\u00a0\ntired it was gonna be throughout the week so there\u00a0\nis that but next is my Foundation my primer is\u00a0\u00a0\nreally seeped in nicely it does kind of start to\u00a0\ntighten up a little bit but it's nothing like one\u00a0\u00a0\nof those like um poor filling primers that really\u00a0\ngrip and tighten your skin but there is a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit more tightening feel than the milk makeup so\u00a0\nthe pros and cons there do with that as you will\u00a0\u00a0\nso Lys they're triple fix serum Foundation I have\u00a0\nthis in the shade dn6 I love this Foundation this\u00a0\u00a0\nis one of what I would consider the most kind of\u00a0\nnatural skin like finishes that I have and one\u00a0\u00a0\nof my best foundation matches now I have some\u00a0\nsolid foundation matches but every time that I\u00a0\u00a0\nhave applied this Foundation I feel like it just\u00a0\nlooks like my skin and it just it just applies\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautifully it really just Blends in it matches\u00a0\nmy chest so well and full disclosure right now\u00a0\u00a0\nI am filming at night once again so I do have my\u00a0\nring light and two other lights in front of me\u00a0\u00a0\nand then of course my back round is lit as well\u00a0\nso you unfortunately won't get the best kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nImpressions with natural lighting but right now\u00a0\nnight lighting and like night filming is the\u00a0\u00a0\nbest that I can do with my schedule but as you\u00a0\ncan see let me scoot back as you can see this\u00a0\u00a0\nis pretty spot on with my chest and in case you\u00a0\nare wondering I prefer to match my chest because\u00a0\u00a0\nit just makes sense to me um I get when\u00a0\npeople match their face but like once you\u00a0\u00a0\ndo the concealer and the primer and the bra\u00a0\nnot the primer once you do the concealer and\u00a0\u00a0\nthe bronzer and the powder it just makes sense\u00a0\nif you're matching your chest that's my opinion\u00a0\u00a0\non it this product gives you a medium to high\u00a0\nmedium coverage level the Finish is definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nnatural skin like I feel like this looks like\u00a0\nmy skin with a slight Luminosity to it and the\u00a0\u00a0\ncombination of this with this primer I\u00a0\nfind that the longevity of the product\u00a0\u00a0\non my particular skin I am combination oily\u00a0\nso I'm oily into T-Zone I am normal in the\u00a0\u00a0\nperimeter it just lasts long this base system\u00a0\nin general lasts long now I don't have their\u00a0\u00a0\npowder and there are a couple other products in\u00a0\ntheir system that I just do not have so I would\u00a0\u00a0\njust be filtering other products in but I will\u00a0\nsay what I do have are Stellar I really think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat they're good nice solid products that\u00a0\nreally really work nicely and I definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nhave been kind of hoarding this product in my\u00a0\ncollection because it is one that I want to get\u00a0\u00a0\na lot of use out of which is stupid I should be\u00a0\nusing it now while it hasn't expired but you know\u00a0\u00a0\nmaturity will help me when it comes to doing all\u00a0\nthat so yeah this is the foundation and the primer\u00a0\u00a0\napplied I do have the concealer and the concealer\u00a0\nI have quite literally Three Shades under\u00a0\u00a0\nthe foundation so the concealer I have it in dn3\u00a0\nI did just pick this up and quite a few of these\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts up literally last year um and I think I\u00a0\nalso became an ambassador maybe last year as well\u00a0\u00a0\nif you're interested in becoming an ambassador\u00a0\nI will do my absolute best to find the link or\u00a0\u00a0\nthe application and have that down below because\u00a0\nlike why not if you want to be a common ambassador\u00a0\u00a0\nI want to make it easier for you so yeah I put a\u00a0\ndecent amount of concealer on not anything crazy\u00a0\u00a0\num especially not like 2017 crazy um but I\u00a0\nstill do conceal in very similar areas to\u00a0\u00a0\npeople who concealed in 2017. just not nearly\u00a0\nas much this once again is a concealer that I\u00a0\u00a0\nwould say is very similar to the foundation it's\u00a0\ngiving you a nice medium solid medium coverage\u00a0\u00a0\nit does give like a skin like finish and I\u00a0\nlike my concealer lighter than my Foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nI do that personally because for me I don't need\u00a0\na lot of coverage but I do like that brightening\u00a0\u00a0\neffect to add Dimension to my face in the full\u00a0\nface so that's why I'm doing what I'm doing I do\u00a0\u00a0\nconceal around my mouth mainly because that\u00a0\nis an area that I've seen other people have\u00a0\u00a0\nlike Darkness around I don't have Darkness around\u00a0\nit but I'm so used to now concealing around and\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of getting that highlighted effect in that\u00a0\narea I just kind of I don't question it I do my\u00a0\u00a0\nforehead because I want to minimize my forehead\u00a0\nit's not the biggest forehead out there but like\u00a0\u00a0\ncyst is larger than charge still so that's why\u00a0\nI conceal my forehead area and then for the way\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I conceal my under eyes it's mainly just\u00a0\nto get a nice lightness all throughout my under\u00a0\u00a0\neye and then also on the side of my nose I don't\u00a0\ndo a lot of concealer as you can see I was able\u00a0\u00a0\nto spread all of that concealer all throughout\u00a0\nthis area and that's all I need personally so so\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is my base system I have their primer their\u00a0\nfoundation and their concealer and truly I really\u00a0\u00a0\nlike these products I don't have any real cons\u00a0\nfor these products the only thing I would say is\u00a0\u00a0\nthere is a slight smell when you come to using the\u00a0\nfoundation but it's very slight it's nothing as\u00a0\u00a0\num apparent as even like the Juvia's place and\u00a0\nthat's saying something because I even I love\u00a0\u00a0\nthat Juvia's Place Foundation I will be doing a\u00a0\nfull face of Judy's Place very soon so just stay\u00a0\u00a0\ntuned for that um but overall I think that all of\u00a0\nthe products that I've shown you guys thus far are\u00a0\u00a0\nsolid and the best part about this particular\u00a0\nbrand especially when we're looking at it in\u00a0\u00a0\ncomparison to its competitors at Sephora these are\u00a0\nrelatively very reasonably priced for Sephora this\u00a0\u00a0\nis like a low end of the spectrum of the high\u00a0\nend range and that's why it works at Sephora\u00a0\u00a0\nand it's really I would say fully competing with\u00a0\nlike the Sephora brand and I haven't tried a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom the Sephora brand but I would say that\u00a0\nthis brand in my opinion is better than the\u00a0\u00a0\nSephora brand I would love to do a full face of\u00a0\nthat brand I just haven't gotten around to it\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's something on my cheek there's a pair\u00a0\nthere's something those are my thoughts next\u00a0\u00a0\nI want to go ahead and apply the cream bronzer\u00a0\nnow I originally picked up two different shades\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm pretty sure I already decluttered the second\u00a0\nshade and I already sent it away to its hopeful\u00a0\u00a0\nnew owner hopefully somebody will choose it from\u00a0\nthe kind of collective groups that I kind of sent\u00a0\u00a0\nmy two packages to but I did keep the one that\u00a0\nworks for me and this is the shade strength I\u00a0\u00a0\nbelieve I also picked up the shade courage which\u00a0\nwas pretty much my skin tone that's why I shipped\u00a0\u00a0\nit to somebody else this is like I said the shade\u00a0\nstrength and as you can see it works if you want\u00a0\u00a0\nto see what the shade courage looks like on\u00a0\nmy skin tone I'm pretty sure I did a bronzer\u00a0\u00a0\nhunt so I will do my absolute best at going\u00a0\nahead and linking that down below for you all\u00a0\u00a0\num but yeah I just it was no purpose in me keeping\u00a0\nit because it wasn't gonna add any form of value\u00a0\u00a0\nto my collection and I wasn't going to use it\u00a0\nso it made sense to just ship it to a frame\u00a0\u00a0\nwho could potentially use it and as you can see it\u00a0\nBlended so easily I'm just using that same sponge\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I applied my concealer my Foundation all of\u00a0\nit and I'm just blending this into my base and\u00a0\u00a0\nit's it's so beautiful once again it's giving\u00a0\noff that same kind of natural skin like finish\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I truly enjoy with this system and it's\u00a0\njust it's I think it's a really really good\u00a0\u00a0\nfor this system if you're trying this particular\u00a0\ncream bronzer and you don't like something that\u00a0\u00a0\nlet's say it's too dark for your skin like I've\u00a0\nseen a couple of people say that it just Blends\u00a0\u00a0\ntoo easily for me that's not a bad thing I think\u00a0\nthat the quicker it Blends the quicker I'm done\u00a0\u00a0\nas you can see I like to get in get out when it\u00a0\ncomes to applying products to my face so this\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct because it's so creamy and so blendable\u00a0\nI can apply it and I'm done I'm done I think\u00a0\u00a0\nI will probably not cut out my blending of this\u00a0\nparticular product and it didn't take me maybe 30\u00a0\u00a0\nseconds to blend out my whole face after I started\u00a0\nand that is a bonus for me although for some\u00a0\u00a0\npeople it's not a bonus I also think it depends\u00a0\non the depth of the shade that you're blending so\u00a0\u00a0\nlike if I was doing this with like maybe let's say\u00a0\nthe current shade I would have been disappointed\u00a0\u00a0\nas I was that's why I bought another shade because\u00a0\nthat shade was not dark enough for me so because\u00a0\u00a0\nit blended into my skin base my skin base because\u00a0\nit blended into my base products so quickly and\u00a0\u00a0\nso well it looked like I didn't put any bronzer\u00a0\non but because I went and got a Deeper Shade in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shade strength now because it's blended into\u00a0\nmy base product so well it looks like it's just a\u00a0\u00a0\ndarker part of my base makeup and not my other\u00a0\nbase products I hope that makes sense I feel\u00a0\u00a0\nlike there's something else on my face we'll deal\u00a0\nwith that when we need to deal with that so this\u00a0\u00a0\nis my base so far like I said I don't have any\u00a0\num powder from the brand and I do have another\u00a0\u00a0\ncream product I have a cream blush I picked this\u00a0\nup I think this was the last thing that I picked\u00a0\u00a0\nup other than the lip product I'm so excited\u00a0\nto try those and this is the cream blush in the\u00a0\u00a0\nshade Inspire I prefer to use my cream products\u00a0\nspecifically blush kind of after I've set and\u00a0\u00a0\npowdered my face but let's just go ahead and\u00a0\nuse this now just so we can get as many things\u00a0\u00a0\non my face in one take so like I said this is\u00a0\nthe cream blush in the shade Inspire I'm just\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to use my um my sponge that is damp of\u00a0\ncourse and I'm just going to use the side that\u00a0\u00a0\nis clean because I did have to clean my sponge\u00a0\nto start today and as you can see this is quite\u00a0\u00a0\na pink based blush I think it is very very pretty\u00a0\nand it builds so if you are somebody who doesn't\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a super super pigmented blush don't get\u00a0\nme wrong it definitely is pigmented but I can\u00a0\u00a0\neasily blend and build this product which is a\u00a0\nbenefit for those who don't like super pigmented\u00a0\u00a0\num blushes I like it I like it a lot so we're just\u00a0\ngoing to build build build and I think I'm going\u00a0\u00a0\nto do like a blush draping type situation I can't\u00a0\nsee if my camera is picking up the blush color I\u00a0\u00a0\nliterally can't see I don't have my glasses on\u00a0\nbut I hopefully you guys can see the blush is\u00a0\u00a0\nright there I actually put it all over my nose\u00a0\nand then I put it here as well so what I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\ndo is hop off camera very very quickly I'm going\u00a0\nto use my Too Faced loose powder in translucent\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is a powder that unfortunately is no longer\u00a0\navailable so I'm trying to just get through it\u00a0\u00a0\num but I still have a wee bit of product left\u00a0\nI then I'm gonna do my brows off camera as well\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I don't think the brand has brow products\u00a0\nbut I just also don't have any brow products in\u00a0\u00a0\nmy collection from them so give me one second I'm\u00a0\njust gonna skip through some of those steps very\u00a0\u00a0\nquickly and then I will come back because we're\u00a0\ngoing to be doing the lips and I'm very very\u00a0\u00a0\nexcited to do the lips because I have both of the\u00a0\nnew products I have a lip liner and a lipstick and\u00a0\u00a0\nI am very very excited to try them out alrighty\u00a0\nguys so I am zoomed in and my brows are done\u00a0\u00a0\nI've powdered I powdered all throughout my face\u00a0\nI did not go ahead and add any additional blush\u00a0\u00a0\nor bronzer I felt like it I wanted to be true to\u00a0\nlike the Lys brand and only use their products\u00a0\u00a0\nas much as possible so there's that or kind\u00a0\nof create the face as much as possible that I\u00a0\u00a0\ncould make if I used all of their products but\u00a0\nlike I said I have new goodies from the brand\u00a0\u00a0\nI have a lip liner and a lip stick once again I\u00a0\nshould have opened these before I started filming\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so of course I picked up the Browns of both\u00a0\nlines so for the lip liner I picked up the shade\u00a0\u00a0\nSoulful it has the little color indicator on\u00a0\nthe side it is a pencil liner and let's see\u00a0\u00a0\nif it gives me any information on the actual\u00a0\nproduct so there are .03 ounces or 0.9 grams\u00a0\u00a0\nof product with this pencil and there is a\u00a0\n12 month shelf life um It's Made in the PRC\u00a0\u00a0\nit's distributed through Lys through Georgia and\u00a0\nit is also cruelty free and there's some other\u00a0\u00a0\nemblems but I quite literally can't indicate I\u00a0\ncan't distinguish what they say so like I said\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is the first time I'm using this lip liner\u00a0\nso I'm just gonna get a mirror and try it out\n[Music]\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so I'm pretty sure you guys can see it in\u00a0\ncamera because I can see it this brown is slightly\u00a0\u00a0\ndeeper than my skin tone and there is a yellow\u00a0\nundertone that's why I was like I ran I did not\u00a0\u00a0\nwalk for this lip liner I love it I love it it is\u00a0\na lip liner that is going to be in rotation there\u00a0\u00a0\nit is a slightly kind of creamy formula before a\u00a0\npencil it's not too too creamy which I appreciate\u00a0\u00a0\nit has that nice kind of wax to cream a ratio that\u00a0\nwill make this last a little bit longer than any\u00a0\u00a0\nother kind of very cream of formula especially\u00a0\nlike if you try the formulas that are in the\u00a0\u00a0\nRoll-Ups or the wind ups those are traditionally\u00a0\na lot more creamier and so this one's not nearly\u00a0\u00a0\nas creamy so I can at least get more use out\u00a0\nof it than I would be able to if it were in\u00a0\u00a0\nthat formula I really hope this makes sense next\u00a0\nlet's go ahead and try the lipstick this is in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shade dreamer this lipstick packaging two\u00a0\nof the three sides have like this feel of like\u00a0\u00a0\na faux leather type effect and on the one tarte\u00a0\npart it actually says l-y-s you can see it right\u00a0\u00a0\nthere this is also like the leatherish side then\u00a0\nyou have that more metallic Sheen situation side\u00a0\u00a0\num you can see it is a very very small bullet\u00a0\nlipstick there and it is of course another Brown\u00a0\u00a0\nso let's see how this works oh okay oh oh oh\u00a0\nokay lighter than I thought okay let's [Music]\u00a0\u00a0\nwe're gonna have to mix we're gonna have to\u00a0\nmix but that's okay let me pull out [Music]\u00a0\u00a0\noh okay um I'm gonna pull the lip liner\u00a0\nback out okay that doesn't look terrible\nit doesn't look terrible at all I\u00a0\nwould love a gloss I would I think\u00a0\u00a0\na gloss would just put the\u00a0\ncherry on top so let's see\nyeah I I have my tower 28 gloss in my top drawer\u00a0\nso I'm just gonna pull a little bit of this\u00a0\u00a0\nand we're just going to top this off yes that\u00a0\nworks beautifully what I will say is this is a\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't want to say dryer formula but it's more\u00a0\nit gives you more tug than the lip liner the lip\u00a0\u00a0\nliner is definitely creamier than the lipstick\u00a0\nthis lipstick shade is definitely lighter than\u00a0\u00a0\nI had kind of hoped I I now that I saw it and\u00a0\nI was putting on I remember it was definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nlighter and that's why I tried to get a lips liner\u00a0\nthat was closer to my skin tone but this lipstick\u00a0\u00a0\nis quite light but as soon as you put a gloss\u00a0\non top it just really brings it all together so\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's no worries there um and another thing I\u00a0\ndid want to mention this product you can close it\u00a0\u00a0\num outside of like the the prongs so as you can\u00a0\nsee this doesn't match up anymore but it does\u00a0\u00a0\ntake a little bit of push like it's not going to\u00a0\nautomatically it's easier if you get them to kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof synchronize the size so I will say that but\u00a0\nthat's just food for thought because these are\u00a0\u00a0\nthe first times I'm trying these products as I\u00a0\nsay always I will come back to give you guys more\u00a0\u00a0\nthoughts on all of these products that I have\u00a0\nbeen trying for the first time throughout this\u00a0\u00a0\nmonth probably later on this month I already have\u00a0\nfilmed a Roundup review and that hopefully will be\u00a0\u00a0\ncoming up on month Wednesday uh and this hopefully\u00a0\nwill be coming up on Friday so hopefully I'll be\u00a0\u00a0\nable to get another Roundup review of sometime in\u00a0\nthe middle of next month featuring quite a few of\u00a0\u00a0\nthese products that I'm trying for the first\u00a0\ntime so yeah there is that now I don't have\u00a0\u00a0\nthe eyeshadow palette now let me explain I did\u00a0\ndo a community post asking you guys asking you\u00a0\u00a0\nguys do you want me to feature and review this\u00a0\nproduct and a lot of you didn't seem like you\u00a0\u00a0\nwanted me to pick it up unless I truly enjoyed the\u00a0\ncolor scheme and the one that I had seen I didn't\u00a0\u00a0\nreally enjoy the color scheme there is a second\u00a0\none that I saw after the fact but once again\u00a0\u00a0\nI just prefer not to purchase from QVC so when\u00a0\nthat palette becomes available either on the lys\u00a0\u00a0\num website or Sephora I will go ahead and purchase\u00a0\nit it's the more neutral tone I would just love\u00a0\u00a0\nto try their formula and like I said I am an\u00a0\nambassador so I think it's nice to kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nhave a good arrangement of their products in my\u00a0\ncollection so there's that stay tuned for that\u00a0\u00a0\num but since these are pretty much all of\u00a0\nthe products that I have from the brand\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna hop off and just kind of finish\u00a0\nup my look I have a highlighter I have an\u00a0\u00a0\neyeshadow palette so I'm just gonna do those\u00a0\nitems very very quickly I might also try to\u00a0\u00a0\nfilm them just so that you guys can see\u00a0\num and maybe I'll try to do a short we'll\u00a0\u00a0\nsee but yeah I will be back to show you guys\u00a0\nthe finished look but this is pretty much it\u00a0\u00a0\nwithout the extras so yeah give me one second\u00a0\nalrighty guys so this is the finished look\nokay guys so this is the finished look\u00a0\nI did quickly film my eye look lashes\u00a0\u00a0\ntoday are the juvie's place Nefertiti lashes\u00a0\nI realized when I was filming my Roundup that\u00a0\u00a0\nI hadn't actually applied these so I wanted\u00a0\nto go ahead and apply these and see how they\u00a0\u00a0\nlook I'm liking how they look today eye shadow\u00a0\nI used the abh um this is the norvina palette or\u00a0\u00a0\nnouveau this is the Nouveau palette I picked\u00a0\nthis up with points during my birthday month\u00a0\u00a0\num I used the to use the Too Faced peach perfect\u00a0\npowder I showed you guys the lip gloss everything\u00a0\u00a0\nelse is Lys so what I want to do very very quickly\u00a0\nis run through the Lys products and kind of talk\u00a0\u00a0\nto you guys about who this brand is meant for and\u00a0\nwho I would recommend this brand for so let's just\u00a0\u00a0\nstart off at the top the Lys gripping primer I\u00a0\nthink this is a great alternative to people who\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to buy a gripping primer from Sephora but\u00a0\ndon't want to purchase the milk makeup for one\u00a0\u00a0\nreason or another they do offer the milk makeup\u00a0\nin a miniature size this one is only available in\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one size but I believe the miniature size of\u00a0\nthe milk is almost the same price if not maybe a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle bit cheaper than this price because this\u00a0\nisn't more than like maybe 13 or so so this is\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely a very affordable gripping primer that\u00a0\nI think is really really good I haven't tried the\u00a0\u00a0\nelf gripping primer so that may be another cheaper\u00a0\nalternative before the gripping primers that I\u00a0\u00a0\nhave tried this is definitely a very nice cheap\u00a0\nalternative and when I do finish my milk makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nI will probably go ahead and really focus in on\u00a0\nthis one just because I already have it in my\u00a0\u00a0\ncollection then we're going into the foundation\u00a0\nthis is a fantastic foundation in my opinion\u00a0\u00a0\nI really love the finish I love the longevity\u00a0\nand the wear time I also think that the actual\u00a0\u00a0\num uh match is beautiful not a lot of Foundations\u00a0\ncan I get such a great match and I think even\u00a0\u00a0\nafter all of my powder the blush the bronzer\u00a0\neverything this is still a great match and for\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I'm very very happy of course you get the\u00a0\nnormal I believe 30 milliliters yes you do and\u00a0\u00a0\nI just really like it I like the packaging it's\u00a0\nall good and dandy I'm very very happy to have it\u00a0\u00a0\nthen we have the concealer this has pretty much\u00a0\nbeen my go-to concealer as of late I've had this\u00a0\u00a0\nin my top drawer just because it's easy convenient\u00a0\nand it gives you the amount of coverage that I\u00a0\u00a0\nparticularly like it does give you once again\u00a0\nmedium coverage very similar to the foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nalthough I think the foundation is a little bit\u00a0\nmore towards the high medium category or section\u00a0\u00a0\nif you will this is really nice it is a kind of I\u00a0\nwould say a nice thin layer or thin product it's\u00a0\u00a0\nnot like a serum thin but it is definitely a cream\u00a0\nthin if that makes any sense you can definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel the thickness but it's not heavy on the face\u00a0\nit doesn't feel heavy at all my face feels very\u00a0\u00a0\nlight I don't feel as though I'm wearing makeup\u00a0\nif we're being honest it feels like I'm not\u00a0\u00a0\nreally wearing anything at all except for Lashes\u00a0\nno matter what style of lashes I can always feel\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I'm wearing lashes so yeah anyways very very\u00a0\nnice product absolutely love it I would definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nrecommend it and once again I have a dn3 which\u00a0\nis Three Shades lighter than the foundation shade\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I have and I like both Shades and I like how\u00a0\nthe full face comes together with these two shades\u00a0\u00a0\nnext thing that I showcased from Lys is their\u00a0\ncream bronzer I have it in the shade strength\u00a0\u00a0\nonce again I will have the cream um bronzer hunt\u00a0\nwhere I showcased both Shades that I had at one\u00a0\u00a0\npoint in my collection Down Below in the event\u00a0\nthat you want to see how both Shades work for\u00a0\u00a0\nsomebody of my complexion this is in the shade\u00a0\nstrength I love the depth that this presents\u00a0\u00a0\nand I love the blendability for me something that\u00a0\nblends quickly efficiently and just effortlessly\u00a0\u00a0\non my base is something that I just can't get\u00a0\nenough of and so this is a very very nice product\u00a0\u00a0\nif I'm trying to do something that's like a 10\u00a0\nminute face or even a five minute face I could\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely see me reaching for this particular\u00a0\nproduct because I can literally draw it on blend\u00a0\u00a0\nit in quickly and then go about the next steps\u00a0\nof my routine to kind of get my face on very\u00a0\u00a0\nvery quickly so I'm very very happy to have this\u00a0\nproduct I definitely would recommend it if you can\u00a0\u00a0\nfind a shade that you like if you're somebody\u00a0\nthat does not like something that blends in\u00a0\u00a0\nso effortlessly maybe don't get this I've also\u00a0\nheard some other people saying they don't like\u00a0\u00a0\nthat like it's not super let's say a parent at\u00a0\nthe final result for me this works with some\u00a0\u00a0\nof my kind of routines if I want like a full\u00a0\non beat and I want to look like shape to the\u00a0\u00a0\ngods no I'm not going to reach for this but for\u00a0\nlike an everyday or kind of a normal natural beat\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah I am going to reach for this and I think it\u00a0\nworks beautifully for that type of makeup look\u00a0\u00a0\nand then the last Lys product that I hadn't tried\u00a0\nbefore this video is the cream blush I really love\u00a0\u00a0\nthis once again this is in the shade Inspire this\u00a0\nwas something that was sold out in what 2021 I do\u00a0\u00a0\nbelieve it actually won the Allure magazine um\u00a0\nCream Blush award for 2021 and this is fantastic\u00a0\u00a0\nit's a really nice shade I picked this shade\u00a0\nbecause it felt like it was going to be the most\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of natural neutral shade on my skin tone I\u00a0\nreally like it I love that it gives a slight flush\u00a0\u00a0\nto the cheeks it's a really really pretty blush\u00a0\nit's not overly creamy something like um the tower\u00a0\u00a0\n28 which I find has a lot of like that petroleum\u00a0\njelly feel you get a lot of pigment with this\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct it's just a typical cream product you know\u00a0\nit's not going to be super super creamy you're not\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to get like a lot of pigment like maybe the\u00a0\nPatrick tall or the one size the one sides blushes\u00a0\u00a0\nthose have a lot of pigment and for some people\u00a0\nthat's just too much pigment I feel like this\u00a0\u00a0\ngives you the right amount of pigment that one\u00a0\nshows up on your skin tone but Blends beautifully\u00a0\u00a0\nso for me this is the perfect formula it really\u00a0\nworks again with this range where it's just solid\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts that really just work and I'm very very\u00a0\nhappy to have this in my collection I definitely\u00a0\u00a0\ncould see me picking up some more shades in the\u00a0\nfuture I just haven't gotten around to it now for\u00a0\u00a0\nthe two products that I tried for the first time\u00a0\ntoday the lip liner I will say is my favorite of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe two lip products I love the shade this is\u00a0\na brown shade with a slightly yellow undertone\u00a0\u00a0\nin my opinion as you could see in the initial\u00a0\napplication of it you saw that like slight yellow\u00a0\u00a0\nshade on my lips I think it's beautiful it is a\u00a0\nnice creamy formula it's not overly creamy which I\u00a0\u00a0\ntruly appreciate I would say this is very similar\u00a0\nif not slightly creamier than the Nyx lip liner\u00a0\u00a0\nforeign so I have this NYX suede lip liner this is\u00a0\na dryer formula than this but they are comparable\u00a0\u00a0\nso if you don't want to spend Lys prices which\u00a0\nonce again to me they're not that bad I like Lys\u00a0\u00a0\nprices I think they're fantastic especially if\u00a0\nwe're considering what it looks like at Sephora\u00a0\u00a0\num so yeah I really like this once again this\u00a0\nis in the shade Soulful I definitely could see\u00a0\u00a0\nme getting more shades of this particular\u00a0\nlip liner I to date lately have only been\u00a0\u00a0\nreally wearing brown lip products though so it\u00a0\nwouldn't make sense for me to really pick up any\u00a0\u00a0\nother lip Shades in their lip liner formula but\u00a0\nif you're somebody who likes a lot of different\u00a0\u00a0\nlip Shades and you're really like really out\u00a0\nthere experimenting to the gods then I would\u00a0\u00a0\nsay try this you can always try to Swatch it\u00a0\nin store I know this is this brand is available\u00a0\u00a0\nin certain stores and I do believe this particular\u00a0\nproduct is available in stores so yeah of course\u00a0\u00a0\num check it out in your local store the last\u00a0\nproduct that I showcase specifically today that\u00a0\u00a0\nis Lys and from that is from Lys is their matte\u00a0\nlipstick now this is truly a matte lipstick it\u00a0\u00a0\ndoesn't have a lot of give when you're applying it\u00a0\nso think like the abh lipsticks I don't know how\u00a0\u00a0\num used to that formula you are\u00a0\nor even if you're used to like the\u00a0\u00a0\num melt lipsticks there's definitely a tug we're\u00a0\neven going into maybe the Nyx suede lipsticks\u00a0\u00a0\nalthough those have a little bit more um silicone\u00a0\nin the formulation so they Glide a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\neasier on the lips this is it you're going to\u00a0\nget some tug as you saw when I was applying it\u00a0\u00a0\nand this particular shade is quite light for\u00a0\nsomebody of my skin tone but as you can see\u00a0\u00a0\nI was able to easily kind of make it work with\u00a0\nthat lip liner and then ultimately with the lip\u00a0\u00a0\ngloss I like the formula so far the formula didn't\u00a0\nfeel dry as you can see I'm not wearing just this\u00a0\u00a0\nlipstick so I can't tell you like if you know 10\u00a0\n15 minutes after I applied it if it still doesn't\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel super dry but in the initial application it\u00a0\ndidn't and I of course will be giving you guys a\u00a0\u00a0\nRoundup after I've tried out these two particular\u00a0\nproducts because these are the newer products\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I haven't reviewed I'm going to be trying\u00a0\nthem multiple times and then I'll be coming back\u00a0\u00a0\nto you guys with a Roundup telling you guys if I\u00a0\nwould have if I would recommend you spending your\u00a0\u00a0\nmoney or not but just in this first impressions\u00a0\nI definitely would say the lip liner is more of\u00a0\u00a0\na thing that I would recommend over the lipstick\u00a0\nso yeah I hope this was a very helpful video for\u00a0\u00a0\nyou guys overall I think this brand is a nice\u00a0\nstep into the high-end market for somebody who\u00a0\u00a0\nis traditionally sticked with drugstore I think\u00a0\nthis is a nice solid brand where anything that\u00a0\u00a0\nyou pick up you're going to enjoy because they're\u00a0\nall really really solid products maybe some aren't\u00a0\u00a0\nlike holy Grails but I'm not one of those people\u00a0\nwho really has holy Grails I don't think I've ever\u00a0\u00a0\nreally considered anything a Holy Grail I just\u00a0\nreally enjoy it I get my use out of it if I want\u00a0\u00a0\nto buy it again I do so that's kind of my thoughts\u00a0\nwith this brand I would love to hear your opinions\u00a0\u00a0\ndown below is this brand a Holy Grail brand\u00a0\nfor you do you love all the products are there\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts that you hate give us your opinions down\u00a0\nbelow and with that said that's all I got for you\u00a0\u00a0\nguys today I hope you guys enjoyed this video\u00a0\nand I'll see you guys in my next one bye guys",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I fell for it too many times. <br><br>I\u2019ve heard a few Youtubers talk about products that they want to try but they wouldn\u2019t purchase and immediately turn around and ask the brand to send them it as PR. I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on. It just makes me look at them differently.**",

        "transcript_text": "hello It's Annabelle\n[Music]\nvery happy to be back today for this new video\nmaybe take Jewel tartlet from tarte cosmetics it's a brand that I love especially\nthe levels of the palettes I started I I started my career roughly in quotes with the\nin bloom tartlet I have fond memories of it I loved this palette I have I still have\nit there is still a little bit of blush inside but not much I confess to you sometimes I miss\nthe edges a little bit to use it but here it is when I saw this palette during my\nlast shopping I said to myself wow let's not quibble this palette is made for the year 2023\nhere they are colors so the place it's neutral colors yes it's\nneutral colors on a base of champagne rose dew of three matte colors three\nluminous colors and that's the damage here you have here the first line starting from the lightest\nwith the little pink peach the bright color that lies there in the last line and well this\nline there then which is on the outside with pretty chestnuts and a pretty chestnut\nwhich has a little aubergine tone inside and I find that with the pink colors well\nhere it is fine give a little bit of pep get out a little not too much of the brown but\nwhich will perhaps help you to smoke your make-up a little bit in any case it's an\nPA in my opinion super trendy 2023 it's left my kiki for the discovery of this palette\nthat bah are no longer made up for info I made my complexion with my foundation ambiance of the\nblue from overless I hope that I will not have fall on my complexion which is already done which is\na little bit bright but not too bright as I said it's really 1023 trends here we\ngo my kiki I'm trying to choose my brush wisely I'm going to take this one and I\n'm going to attack and well I'm going to try to apply them all I'm going to take this little peach pink\nhere in the pad here it's a little a little a little dusty I was going to\ntell you it's a little a little powdery and I'm going to come and do my eyelid crease of\ncourse I applied an eyelid base it's which I did everything here so\nI do my eyelid crease and then well I just stretch outwards as much in the\npad it's a little powdery as much on here I didn't have any fall particularly in one direction\nit's because there's more color it's quite pretty it's quite thin the pigmentation is\nthere if I intensify a little bit more yeah girl she does I'm going to apply some also roots\nto already bring a little color\nI'm doing the second eye here's my transition color in the color the little pink\nand applied this pretty it's cute it works well well well here\nI'm going to always come with the same brush and well take the matte color\na little bit light brown and I will come to re-intensify my eyelid crease\nthen in the small pad no it's not particularly powdery on the other hand\nit's true that don't forget to shake well so as not to have any inconvenience so here I'm coming to\nintensify my inner corner a little bit and there I'm more in my eyelid crease\nc it's not bad I do the same on the other side\nthe advantage of these colors is that it skates really quite well quite easily the gradient is\ndone almost by itself I'm going to come and take the darkest brown always with the same\nbrush there I'm really going to intensify well my outer corner and I kept the same passion\nand there we can see right away that it settles very very well we just slowly intensify\nit's not bad I put a little bit back little on\nthe tip of my brush and I'm going to come and put some directly on my lash line\nit's very pretty it's well pigmented it works relatively very well no it's\nreally it's really not bad I do the same guess where on the other side here I like a lot\nI like beautiful blow because in addition with this small bread this small brush which is not all the same\nbadly which is still quite long at the level of the hairs well the smokiness of my lash line was\nreally done in two soup spoon strokes and the eye shadows\nworked really well now I'm going to apply my luminous colors then of course I\n'm talking to you I'm saying to myself brush not brush I'm going to take a brush I'm trying to\nfind a small brush eh brushes no he's not that small he's a little bit\na bit like a fan nose but pretty hard enough and I'm going to come and pick it up\nand well this pretty light we're going to see what it gives to the brush it picks up\nquite well I love the little one the little mirror inside it's really very nice and\nthere I'm going come and apply it by lightly rubbing it judiciously\nin the center of the eyelids and well I would say that with a\nbrush it applies very very well I'm going to come and rub it a little\nthere here is the center of the eyelids is pulled outwards and the color is quite pretty\non the other hand Being there I just realized that with the brush when I applied it\ngave me a small stain maybe not there is a little more glitter at this level\nhere I am going to melt the center material and pull towards the outside the colors\nmatch very well and it applies really well with a brush it's very luminous honestly\ndon't worry about it with your fingers I don't think it's Patchi it doesn't hurt\nno in fact it's not a little it's not a stain that I have no I think it's just a\nlittle more glitter I do the same on the other side it applies really great\nthe colors are very fine it's enough pretty the colors are not out of the ordinary\nI agree with you but it's pretty it's bright I'm going to come and take a\nnew brush and I'm going to continue and I'm going to come and apply this color which is bright\nand I'm going come to complete my eyelid a little bit\nand I think that my brush is not very it is hard here\nand I I'm going to come so apply along\nthis brush here doesn't go\nthis brush there doesn't go at all it went fluffy I'm going to take one that's much\nsofter and I'm coming to pick it up but maybe it's a color that applies to the finger\nno it's just the brush that was wrong\nhere and there we are on a color a little bit lighter than this one but then it's\nreally it's really great from subtle I I would almost say that it would look more like\na little topper I don't apply a little more ma'am plus yeah the gradient isn't bad afterwards\nit's not super obvious I do the same on the other side I'll tell you with this little\nluminous color that -here the brush makes the difference I really needed a brush a little\nmore flexible to really deposit the material it's a there it's a color that is much\nmore then yes it is luminous but much more transparent ideal for example If I had\nmade my whole eyelid pressed down and I would be dead nude just apply a small luminous veil over\nthis color would have been sensational me I like it's discreet it's it's luminous on the other\nhand it's still quite luminous I'm going to come and take I don't know what that a little brush a\nlittle bally but quite flexible and I'm going to come and take the last color the little champagne\nit takes very well I shake by acquired conscience and I come to work my internal corner\nand there there is no doubt it marks well I come put a little bit on my racism\nhere's the corner of light we can see it really it's really not bad\nlittle palette but frankly there are there are a lot of possibilities I'm doing the\nsecond side it's really she's really super nice she knows how to work really without\nany difficulty I was even able to do my eyelids at the same time my slow motion smoking is just exactly\nright I could have added a little bit of light at the level of the eyelashes I\ntell you I 'could have why don't I do it you're going to tell me why I don't\nI'm going to take this brush there a little hard and I'll just come and take a little bit\non the tip and I'm going to just do a small light spot flush with the eyelashes\nhere is in the center in the center of the eye a little bit really with the tip of the brush a little\nlight effect I used the six colors but frankly the same in mono even in duo a mixture of\nthese two colors must be just sublime this one in total matte look must be very pretty embellished\nfor example with this color there or this color there it's super hot I'm finishing my make- up and\ni'll be back to you here i finished my make-up what did i do i applied my\nsephora long lasting pencil in flesh color in my lower mucosa i applied the\ntravel size mascara on tubing from tarte and the lipstick in color 508 the genius pen from\nKiko I think the set is really very very very very nice what can you say about\nthis little palette when you can drag it anywhere me j I loved it because then\nthe mirror inside to put on makeup is real like enough finally I didn't need\nto take out my naughty him there very ugly but then there it's really great the headlights got\ninvolved great without any problem the colors well yes when it's bright it's bright\nwhen it's matte it's matte I didn't have any hair loss and so that's really not negligible\nespecially since I had done my complexion just here the colors are just super trendy it's papachi that's\nwhat a little ideal color palette yes neutral in pink roses a little here\nit goes everywhere it's timeless I'll tell you again winter spring summer and autumn you\ndraw this palette there will be no bad taste here I hope anyway you will have\nhad a good time in my company if so don't forget the little\nblue thumbs up it's more than if it's not done yet well don't wait subscribe if\na video every Friday activate the little bell it's your never if the idea took me t\nto make you a little surprise video and then and then and then bah join me on Instagram\nI'm there almost all week here bah on what I tell you next week Ciao",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

                "comment": "Sorry for the long comment in advance!!  I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

She has used filters too.  She has yet to apologize and she shouldn&#39;t be given the benefit of the doubt at all. That ship sailed.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

        "transcript_text": "[Music] I wanted to come on here and talk a little\u00a0\nbit more about a blush that I've really been\u00a0\u00a0\nliking. This is the Dior Backstage Rosy Glow blush\u00a0\nin the color 001, light pink. This blush retails\u00a0\u00a0\nforty dollars for 0.16 ounces or 4.5 grams. I\u00a0\npurchased this directly from the Dior website,\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I know it's also available at Sephora and\u00a0\nalso Dior has recently moved over to Ulta now I\u00a0\u00a0\nbelieve. Interestingly, there's only two colors\u00a0\ncurrently in this line. this pink color and a\u00a0\u00a0\ncoral. I don't like orangey blushes so I wasn't\u00a0\ninterested in picking that one up. This color,\u00a0\u00a0\n001 light pink is supposed to give you a healthy\u00a0\nnatural glow. I would argue that a cool tone pink\u00a0\u00a0\nflush is not really a natural tone, but I still\u00a0\nappreciate the concept. What drew me to try and\u00a0\u00a0\nbuy this blush is that you don't really\u00a0\nsee a ton of matte cool tone pink blushes,\u00a0\u00a0\nthis bubblegum pretty pink, in the market.\u00a0\nDon't get me wrong, there are definitely\u00a0\u00a0\ncheaper and other alternatives out there but\u00a0\nI think coming from a luxury brand, it's what\u00a0\u00a0\ninterested me in trying this out. I really liked\u00a0\nDiors concealer, so I'm not super unfamiliar with\u00a0\u00a0\nthe brand. Let's get into trying it. So I'll\u00a0\nshow you what I look like without any blush\u00a0\u00a0\non. I just have concealer, some powder and I've\u00a0\ndone my eyebrows and curled my lashes as well.\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm using my hakuhodo blush brush in S110. I\u00a0\nreally like to get a lot of products on the brush.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd at a first pass, you can see that it is\u00a0\npretty transparent. Even though the color in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe pan can be a little intimidating, it looks\u00a0\nlike a bright pink. The pigment is definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nbuildable and it starts off pretty sheer. I\u00a0\nlike to apply this color specifically going\u00a0\u00a0\nup past the apples of my cheeks almost to my\u00a0\ntemples. Just the way that I like to wear it\u00a0\u00a0\nand I feel like it gives a really pretty, not\u00a0\nexactly natural, but it gives a nice blush.\u00a0\u00a0\nI have oily skin so I prefer powder blushes.\u00a0\nThey just work better with my skin.

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

She lies about the false lashes and then didn&#39;t respond about it at all and she hid the sponsored statement and doubled down on her lies and made a joke out of her actions in subsequent videos. She has used filters too.  She has yet to apologize and she shouldn&#39;t be given the benefit of the doubt at all. That ship sailed.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

think of them\u00a0\u00a0\nand definitely keep on watching I personally\u00a0\nlike to start off with my eyes first so we're\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna go ahead and we're gonna dive on into this\u00a0\ngrind palette so I'm going to start off with this\u00a0\u00a0\nshade right here this is called zest so I'm just\u00a0\ngoing to pick a little bit of that up on a brush\u00a0\u00a0\num I will say there's not not a lot\u00a0\nof kick up in this pan at all so\u00a0\u00a0\nyou don't like kick up then you don't have to\u00a0\nworry about it with that shade for sure again it's\u00a0\u00a0\nreally nice really pigmented uh Blends beautifully\u00a0\njust easy to just you know build up and go\nI'm next going to go into the shade\u00a0\nright here this is called grind\u00a0\u00a0\nis going to take a little bit of that on my brush\u00a0\nthis shade however does have quite a bit of pickup\u00a0\u00a0\nwhereas the other one did not so right now we're\u00a0\n50 50 on the cake up in the pan but I'm not really\u00a0\u00a0\nexperiencing any Fallout onto the face again\u00a0\nnice and pigmented Blends easily it's not muddy\u00a0\u00a0\nor anything like that it literally just Blends so\u00a0\neasily and effortlessly to the eyes into the eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nonto the lid woof and for the outer corner I'm\u00a0\ngoing to go into this shade right here called\u00a0\u00a0\nHustle this one also has you know a pretty\u00a0\ngood amount of Hiccup as well and we're just\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna pack that onto the outer corner now\u00a0\nthat I'm kind of putting them onto the lids\u00a0\u00a0\num I mean you can definitely tell that like\u00a0\nthe shade that we went in with before is\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent but I almost feel like they're\u00a0\nkind of similar in a way that I kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nwould have appreciated it being like like\u00a0\na little bit deeper Maybe I don't know\ny'all can hear my animals eating it's\u00a0\nbreakfast time for the mall cat or dogs\nthey're all just like hello I'm hungry\u00a0\nthank you ma'am I am now uh Nick glitter\u00a0\u00a0\nglue primed my eyelids we're gonna go on into\u00a0\nlet's do this shade right here this is called\u00a0\u00a0\nmotivate hold on is this actually a shimmer or\u00a0\nis this a matte with like Shimmer properties\u00a0\u00a0\nokay yeah it's a shimmer so I'm gonna start\u00a0\nwith that kind of tap that onto the lid\nokay all right it's not bad it's not\u00a0\nawful it's a little bit deeper than\u00a0\u00a0\nI was really wanting uh Shimmer wise for on\u00a0\nthe eyes but I might be able to remedy that\u00a0\u00a0\nso I have this Kaja stack um so I'm gonna take a\u00a0\nlittle bit of this middle shade I don't know these\u00a0\u00a0\nare all just called Orange Blossom so I don't\u00a0\nthink each shade has like an individual name\nand I'm just gonna go on top of that shade all\u00a0\nright I think that that saved it you know quite a\u00a0\u00a0\nbit so I'm gonna now take this kaleidos this is in\u00a0\nthe shade oh I hate trying to read these Solaris\nwhich is kind of like more of like a orangish\u00a0\ntype shade and I'm just gonna put that in like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe inner portion of my eye oh okay it's\u00a0\na little bit deeper than I was expecting\nso now I'm ready to move right on into the\u00a0\nmakeup by Mario surreal skin Foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nmine is in one cool so again it\u00a0\ncomes with a pump it's in a glass\u00a0\u00a0\nbottle but it looks like there's like\u00a0\nplowing like glitter particles in here\nokay all right so here's like a pump and a\u00a0\nfourth I'm going to I don't really notice\u00a0\u00a0\na lot of glitter or anything while it's on\u00a0\nthe back of my hand oh but it's there okay\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm just gonna start taking this\u00a0\nand stippling this into my face\nI don't really notice a whole\u00a0\nlot of ascent to it at all\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah like none at all oh I hate\u00a0\nbaby hairs I hate baby hairs hi\nhmm\nokay all right first and foremost it is sinking\u00a0\ninto the skin so that's at least a positive so\u00a0\u00a0\nI would say a full pump is probably all that I\u00a0\nneed for my like really dry skin I don't feel\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I need any more than that um I feel\u00a0\nlike this is kind of a a medium coverage\u00a0\u00a0\num you can definitely still see you know some bits\u00a0\nand pieces of like my redness let me see if you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan build this up any I don't want to build it up\u00a0\na lot so I'm just going to like dab just like the\u00a0\u00a0\ntiniest of dots I want to focus this right where\u00a0\nlike my redness is the worst so on my cheek area\nokay keep that cover it up it looks like it\u00a0\ndid on the other side okay yeah there we go\num you know it does provide\u00a0\nyou know it does kind of um\nadd more coverage I don't find it to be\u00a0\nlike you know when I added that extra layer\u00a0\u00a0\ntwo thick and heavy this is a very\u00a0\nglowy glowy glowy glowy Foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't no yeah it does have a little bit of\u00a0\nsome like shot like glitter specs it's not\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a ton like you see in the bottle but you can\u00a0\ndefinitely see some little Sparks here and there\u00a0\u00a0\num this is very very glowy this\u00a0\nis very glowy I don't know if it's\u00a0\u00a0\nit's glowy and tacky and we're gonna try this Kaja\u00a0\u00a0\ncheek stamp so I need to remove this\u00a0\nlittle film before using so hold on here\nokay and this is in the shade does it say s bossy\u00a0\nokay so you're supposed to take this heart-shaped\u00a0\u00a0\nthing and you like push it into here and then\u00a0\nyou just like stamp it onto your face okay\nokay so there's one stamp each I'm\u00a0\nnot sure how you're supposed to keep\u00a0\u00a0\nit sanitary maybe it's just not meant\u00a0\nto be sanitary I don't know huh okay\ndoes it okay it provides a little bit\u00a0\nof like color to the cheeks but like\u00a0\u00a0\nit's not a lot okay so let's let's\u00a0\nuh let's try let's try another layer\nlet's take this happy-go-lucky\u00a0\nheart-shaped little thing it's like\nokay well almost dropped it\u00a0\nthat could have been a disaster\u00a0\u00a0\nokay okay I added some extra\u00a0\nstamping let's see what happens here\nokay okay yeah I feel like yeah you\u00a0\nit's still not like a ton of color\u00a0\u00a0\num like it does provide some color but again it's\u00a0\njust like not a lot you'd have to really layer\u00a0\u00a0\nthis up if you wanted something a lot more Punchy\u00a0\nthan this because it's just not looking much\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent I mean you know you have a little bit of\u00a0\ncolor but it's just not not like a ton I honestly\u00a0\u00a0\nthought I was filming this whole time for the\u00a0\nlower lash line honestly all I did was just take\u00a0\u00a0\nthe two darker oranges and just smoke on my lash\u00a0\nline for the inner corner I want to go into this\u00a0\u00a0\nKaja stack again I want to use this top shade so\u00a0\nlet me see if I can get it to pick up on a brush\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich I can I want to kind of go over this part\u00a0\nas well kind of lighten it just like a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nwhere it still provides like some you know\u00a0\nsomething a little bit different just because\u00a0\u00a0\nI didn't realize it was going to be like as\u00a0\ndark as it is you live and you learn okay you\u00a0\u00a0\nlive and you learn period we're now going to\u00a0\ngo ahead and we're gonna dive on into this J\u00a0\u00a0\ncat you glow girl baked highlighter mine is\u00a0\nin the shade c c what the heck Seaside Frost\u00a0\u00a0\nhi um I will say like it looks like it's\u00a0\nlike an opal but then it's like gold at\u00a0\u00a0\nthe same time so I hope this isn't like too\u00a0\ndark because this was the lightest one that\u00a0\u00a0\nthey had so I will cry if it's like too\u00a0\ndark I don't know it could be it could be\u00a0\u00a0\nnope it is definitely like more of like an\u00a0\nicy like white or like opal shade than it is\u00a0\u00a0\nmore of like that gold and it just has like a\u00a0\nlittle bit like a gold shift to it which makes\u00a0\u00a0\nit really pretty but I don't feel like it's\u00a0\nlike overbearing or anything like that so now\u00a0\u00a0\nwe're gonna go ahead we're gonna move on into\u00a0\nsome lips so the first thing that we have is\u00a0\u00a0\nwe're gonna have this from Clarity Cosmetics\u00a0\nthis is a lip liner in the shade in the shade\noh no it's on the bottom okay bourbon took\u00a0\na minute it took a minute but we found it\nthen now that I've got the lips lying kind of\u00a0\nfilled in a little bit I'm going to now take\u00a0\u00a0\nthis Makeup Forever Rouge artist intense color\u00a0\nbeautifying lipstick in the shade burning clay\nI'm just going to fill that in kind of the center\nthen the last part that we have is the\u00a0\nmakeup by Mario Glock which I can't find\u00a0\u00a0\nnow it was literally right in front of\u00a0\nme I mean of course it was and this is\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to be in the shade golden nude and\u00a0\nI'm just going to throw this right on top\noh yeah that's pretty\num pretty it's thin but really\u00a0\nhydrating very very glossy\u00a0\u00a0\nhas like a nice like kind of like Fruity scent\u00a0\nto it but it's not strong it's not overpowering\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's really really light so I really like\u00a0\nthis lip with this with this eye look so here\u00a0\u00a0\nis the completed and final look testing out\u00a0\nsome new makeup we can do a little bit of a\u00a0\u00a0\nclose-up the skin is looking pretty good pretty\u00a0\ndecent I do have a lot of texture especially in\u00a0\u00a0\nthis area which is why I use like a more\u00a0\nof a pore filling primer other than that I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink the rest of the face looks really really\u00a0\ngood so let's go ahead and let's get into the\nwe are now going to rank all these products\u00a0\nfrom my least favorite to my most favorite\u00a0\u00a0\nwith an explanation of why I love it or why I\u00a0\ndon't so let's go ahead let's hop on in first\u00a0\u00a0\nand last place is going to be this Kaja cheek\u00a0\nstamp I think like this is like cutesy and fun\u00a0\u00a0\nbut like this is something I would probably\u00a0\ngive like my nine-year-old daughter to like\u00a0\u00a0\nbe cutesy and fun with just because one yeah\u00a0\nit's got like the hardship with cutesy's phone\u00a0\u00a0\nokay but even with like building it a few\u00a0\ndifferent times it just didn't get to the\u00a0\u00a0\nlevel of pigment or intensity that I really\u00a0\nwanted um it's just very very very sheer if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou are new to cream products and you're just\u00a0\nlike oh I would love something super sheer that\u00a0\u00a0\nI have to build up and even when you're trying\u00a0\nto build it up it takes a long time for it to\u00a0\u00a0\nbuild up you'll like this next up is going to be\u00a0\nthe clarity lip liner and bourbon this is a very\u00a0\u00a0\num creamy creamy nice uh formula to it I will say\u00a0\nthough I did try swatching a couple of the other\u00a0\u00a0\nones because I did purchase others but these are\u00a0\nso creamy that the tips on these other two like\u00a0\u00a0\neasily just like Snapped right off and so I'd\u00a0\nhave to like re-uh resharpen them like I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nmind like creamy and also the same powers are that\u00a0\ngreat but I don't mind like creamy lip liners like\u00a0\u00a0\nI prefer a creamy lip liner but I don't want one\u00a0\nthat's going to be so creamy that it's just like\u00a0\u00a0\nbreaking all the time and I have to be like super\u00a0\ngentle like I'm trying to just like line my lips\u00a0\u00a0\nand go I'm not trying to say here and baby it\u00a0\nokay like that's just me um you know and then\u00a0\u00a0\nagain like the saying power just like isn't that\u00a0\ngreat next up is going to be this Makeup Forever\u00a0\u00a0\num lipstick Rouge artist lipstick um number one I\u00a0\nthink this is really beautiful it's comfortable I\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't have any issues like the shade is pigmented\u00a0\nthe only reason why it's ranked lower is I'm just\u00a0\u00a0\nnot super into like lipsticks um I'm more into\u00a0\nlike liquid lipsticks and maybe pairing it with\u00a0\u00a0\na gloss or something but for the most part I'm not\u00a0\nreaching into lipsticks a ton next up is going to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe this kaleidos eyeliner um here the thing is um\u00a0\nI really really liked the green one that I tried\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one I did lighten it up you know with that\u00a0\ninner Corner shade so I like that more this was\u00a0\u00a0\njust like I don't know a little bit deeper than\u00a0\nI was expecting I don't know what exactly I was\u00a0\u00a0\nexpecting I was expecting it to be like a lighter\u00a0\nOrange um like that but it's more like this\u00a0\u00a0\nso that's kind of where the shift is more catching\u00a0\nbecause it's that deeper and darker one so for me\u00a0\u00a0\nthis just isn't the color for me but I do love\u00a0\nthis formula and I love how well it stays I love\u00a0\u00a0\nthe like the shifts the color pigment things\u00a0\nlike that this is really good this just isn't\u00a0\u00a0\na color for me next up is going to be the makeup\u00a0\nby Mario gloss um again I think it was like very\u00a0\u00a0\nvery it's a very thin gloss but it provides\u00a0\nreally good shine it provides um it's like\u00a0\u00a0\nhydration it provides smoothness it's not sticky\u00a0\nit's a really really good gloss again I'm just not\u00a0\u00a0\nmuch of a gloss type person I'm just not next up\u00a0\nis going to be this from Jay cat the euclow girl\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is like surprisingly like Jay cat's a really\u00a0\ncheap brand and this is a phenomenal highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\num for it being as cheap as it is like this Rivals\u00a0\nlike some really good like high-end one for like\u00a0\u00a0\nliterally a fraction of the cost it's really nice\u00a0\nyou can build it up to include some like a big a\u00a0\u00a0\nlot of intensity like me or um what you know or\u00a0\nyou could just like you know tone it down for\u00a0\u00a0\nmore like a lip from within whatever the case next\u00a0\nis going to be the palette from on Earth unearthly\u00a0\u00a0\nCosmetics again I really like the mattes I like\u00a0\nthe look that I created a good portion of my\u00a0\u00a0\nissue is kind of within the shimmers this is the\u00a0\nonly like orangish shade you've got like you've\u00a0\u00a0\ngot like a pinky shade you've got like a like\u00a0\nmatte like normal a brown and purple type Shimmer\u00a0\u00a0\nyou have this right here which is like a lighter\u00a0\nlike green and gold and then you have this right\u00a0\u00a0\nhere which is like a green um I would have wished\u00a0\nthere would have been something kind of like this\u00a0\u00a0\nbut these are definitely more topperish shades um\u00a0\nversus you know ones that you're really going to\u00a0\u00a0\nsee super well on the eye I would have appreciated\u00a0\nsomething that was just like a little bit lighter\u00a0\u00a0\num for like the orange because the there are\u00a0\na lot of orange masks like there's not like a\u00a0\u00a0\nton of greens Browns or anything like that like\u00a0\nliterally it's all oranges and then one green\u00a0\u00a0\num so I would have really appreciated like uh\u00a0\nlike instead of this shade that being like a\u00a0\u00a0\nlight lighter orange shade that is actually like\u00a0\nreally good in shimmery not like a topperish type\u00a0\u00a0\nshade that has more of like a black base that\u00a0\nwould have made me happier but overall I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nimpressed with the palette I really like an\u00a0\nEarthly Cosmetics if you like really pretty\u00a0\u00a0\norangish kind of tones you're really gonna like\u00a0\nthis palette next up in second place is going to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe the makeup by Mario Foundation um when I\u00a0\nfirst saw this out of the box and I saw that\u00a0\u00a0\nit had glitter in it I was I was panicking I\u00a0\nwas 100 panicking um and then I was like oh\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is going to emphasize my texture a whole lot\u00a0\nlike this is not gonna be good it does emphasize\u00a0\u00a0\nyour texture like let me just let me just say\u00a0\nthat but it just key it just holds its glow\u00a0\u00a0\neven after I've sat with my Maybelline Fit loose\u00a0\nme Maybelline Fit Me Loose Powder wow Carrington\u00a0\u00a0\num so it's really really beautiful I love um the\u00a0\nI love like the glowiness that it gives I love\u00a0\u00a0\nhow it just sinks into the skin it doesn't feel\u00a0\nheavy on the skin it doesn't look heavy on the\u00a0\u00a0\nskin you know this is what my skin looks like\u00a0\neven after like setting it with powder like\u00a0\u00a0\nso I don't know how well you're gonna like this if\u00a0\nyou have oily skin I have dry skin like very dry\u00a0\u00a0\nskin like holy Santa Barbara California dry skin\u00a0\nlike hello Sahara Desert like there is nothing\u00a0\u00a0\non there's nothing oily about my skin it's just\u00a0\ndry so I really like that so that brings me to\u00a0\u00a0\nnumber one is this little Kaja stack this little\u00a0\ncasual stack is good I used um you know I use the\u00a0\u00a0\nshade right here to like add to the lid and then I\u00a0\nused this top shade right here for like the inner\u00a0\u00a0\ncorner and to kind of do lighten up the little\u00a0\nthing the little soupy boopity whatever you want\u00a0\u00a0\nto call it I don't know something like that um and\u00a0\nthen there's one that we didn't try which is kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof more of like a like brownish type color but\u00a0\nI think these are really really pretty I don't\u00a0\u00a0\never hear anybody talking about them but they\u00a0\ndo have such like a beautiful just like glittery\u00a0\u00a0\nshine to it that I find really really pretty on\u00a0\nthe eyes like this is the kind of shimmers that\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I'm talking about like we could have had\u00a0\nthe second one right here be like the overall\u00a0\u00a0\nlike the orange option that could have been in the\u00a0\nunearthly palette that wasn't so that is it

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

She has used filters too.  She has yet to apologize and she shouldn&#39;t be given the benefit of the doubt at all. That ship sailed.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I use the MA:NYO Bifida Biome Ampoule Toner in my AM routine.The Galactomy Serum is amazing too!\n\n\ud83d\udc96 Items Mentioned:\n~ Etude House Tint My Brows Gel Eyebrow Long Lasting Liner, Brown: https://amzn.to/3YVgxaW\n~ Etude House Tint My Brows Gel, Brown: https://www.etude.com/int/en/index.php/tint-my-brows-gel-new.html\n~ Etude House Tint My 4-Tip Brow (#02 Dark Brown): https://amzn.to/3YTnx7W\n~ Urban Decay Brow Blade Waterproof Eyebrow Pencil & Ink Stain, Taupe Trap: https://www.sephora.com/product/brow-blade-waterproof-eyebrow-pencil-ink-stain-P440905?skuId=2182319&icid2=products%20grid:p440905:product\n~ Benefit Cosmetics Goof Proof Waterproof Easy Shape & Fill Eyebrow Pencil, #2: https://www.sephora.com/product/goof-proof-brow-pencil-P408218?skuId=2217511&icid2=products%20grid:p408218:product\n~ Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner: https://www.sephora.com/product/P458219\n~ MA:NYO Bifida Biome Ampoule Toner: https://amzn.to/3Es0rgF\n~ MA:NYO Galactomy Clearskin Toner: https://amzn.to/41f7qTT\n~ MA:NYO Galactomy Niacin Essence Korean Niacinamide Facial Serum: https://amzn.to/3YSCVSc\n~ StriVectin Tighten & Lift Peptight Serums for Eyes: https://amzn.to/3InpJh3\n~ The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum: https://www.sephora.com/product/the-ordinary-deciem-lactic-acid-10-ha-2-P427413?skuId=2031433&icid2=products%20grid:p427413:product\n~ Farmacy Honeymoon Glow AHA Resurfacing Night Serum: https://www.sephora.com/product/P434548\n~ Topicals Faded Serum for Dark Spots & Discoloration: https://www.sephora.com/product/topicals-faded-serum-for-dark-spots-discoloration-P470259?skuId=2457042&icid2=products%20grid:p470259:product\n~ Nadinola Fade Cream Extra Strength: https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nadinola-Fade-Cream-Extra-Strength-2-25-oz/592438863\n~ Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Pro+.5% Power Facial Serum: https://amzn.to/3Ilf8Dd\n~ Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream Face Moisturizer: https://amzn.to/3ZcYLQ8\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n\nMusic From Thematic https://app.hellothematic.com/?via=angela-shiraki: Music by Public Library Commute  - Mile High - https://thmatc.co/?l=C6BBFFD4\n\nThanks for watching!

and\u00a0\nthat is like what I love really I love crafts but\u00a0\u00a0\nskincare makeup I love all of that um that's my\u00a0\nnumber one favorite I just don't like to come on\u00a0\u00a0\nhere with no makeup which I'm doing right now so\u00a0\nI just got out of the shower my face is totally\u00a0\u00a0\nclean off I have nothing on so I gotta hurry\u00a0\nand put something on because I have dry skin so\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah I need moisture yeah I'm gonna try this\u00a0\ntint my brow gel and this idea came up because\u00a0\u00a0\nI've been loving this product so this is the tint\u00a0\nmy four tip brow and what this product is is a\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a micro bleeding tint but the kind of tint\u00a0\nthat lasts like three days and you know I can't\u00a0\u00a0\nfind anything else on the market except for the\u00a0\nUrban Decay brow blade that I absolutely love\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I'm like this ink so if you haven't seen\u00a0\nit before number one it has a waterproof pencil\u00a0\u00a0\non one side and an ink stain on the other\u00a0\nand it's just the most awesome little tip\u00a0\u00a0\nmy brush tip and it's so good but I'm\u00a0\nlike is it gonna last that long and really\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't like this kind of small fine tip brow\u00a0\npencils if I'm going to use a brow pencil I like\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Goof Proof one by benefit that has the angle\u00a0\nI mean it's just so fast with the fat angled\u00a0\u00a0\none versus a skinny tip one anyway so I've been\u00a0\nlooking for a product like the ink stain but in\u00a0\u00a0\na full size and I used to get these Korean beauty\u00a0\nboxes you know just some random sample ones and I\u00a0\u00a0\nwould always get something like this a marker from\u00a0\nCleo and I think it's called Cleo kill brow pen\u00a0\u00a0\nbut when I search for it they don't make it\u00a0\nanymore it's like super hard to find and I did\u00a0\u00a0\na whole video on this one and that I went to\u00a0\ngo look online to buy a backup and I couldn't\u00a0\u00a0\neven find it it was like or I could but it was\u00a0\nlike really expensive or really hard to get so\u00a0\u00a0\nI didn't want to post that video and tell\u00a0\nyou about an awesome product that you can't\u00a0\u00a0\neven get anymore right anyways this is an\u00a0\nawesome one because if you can still get it\u00a0\u00a0\num certain Korean stores might still have\u00a0\nit in person it's just a four tip marker\u00a0\u00a0\nreally and then how I used it was I put it\u00a0\non at night and I let it stay on overnight\u00a0\u00a0\nand then in the morning you know I wash my\u00a0\nface and wash it off and I have really good\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I already have tattooed brows but they're\u00a0\nlight and you know they're fading I haven't got\u00a0\u00a0\nit done for like three years like before coven\u00a0\nso they're kind of fading but not enough where\u00a0\u00a0\nI want to get it done again because it's\u00a0\na pain and it hurts so well that hurts but\u00a0\u00a0\nit's not super fun and it takes 10 days to heal\u00a0\nso hard to find those 10 days when you don't\u00a0\u00a0\nsee anyone and don't mind having scabby brows\u00a0\nanyways so I want to show you this product because\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is still available and I just bought this\u00a0\nyesterday at the face shop it's a Korean cosmetic\u00a0\u00a0\nstore we have it in Hawaii there must be some on\u00a0\nthe mainland that have it but if you can order\u00a0\u00a0\nonline this is easy to find weirdly this one is\u00a0\nnot but it's like the same it's by Etude house\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know they might be just discontinuing\u00a0\nit I really didn't want to use this one just\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause this is a peeling gel and I hardly\u00a0\nhave any eyebrows I mean if you look closely\u00a0\u00a0\nthe tattoo really helps and I don't have that\u00a0\nmuch hair and I want to keep the hair that's there\u00a0\u00a0\nso quick PM routine I'm using I always use a\u00a0\ntoner this one is a glow recipe toner I either\u00a0\u00a0\ngo between this one or this one this one is just\u00a0\na nice hydrating one it has those um glycosamines\u00a0\u00a0\nI forgot what the thing in the Patera the\u00a0\nsk2 that says the G sounds like glycosamine\u00a0\u00a0\nanyways I usually use a toner with that that's\u00a0\nKorean because it's same thing and it's cheaper\u00a0\u00a0\num so I'm going to use this and all I do is\u00a0\nput like a quarter quarter size in my head\u00a0\u00a0\nand they're usually really runny so I just\u00a0\ngo like this and then Pat it on my face\naway gotta make the right choice so I used\u00a0\nto do like the Korean tense stuff routine\u00a0\u00a0\nand I don't know I got busy so now\u00a0\nI paired it down to like four steps\u00a0\u00a0\nand then I will do like my eye\u00a0\ncream I'm just using this right now\u00a0\u00a0\nreally I want something with a little\u00a0\nbit of retinol but not something that's\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to irritate it because I have a really\u00a0\nsensitive skin so I'm just getting a little bit\nnot too much can I use my finger and I'm just\u00a0\ngonna Pat it around my eyes so start at the bottom\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of smooth it out and pack\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I also do like the top because I have dry skin\u00a0\nand I don't like to have dry eyelids but you don't\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't go close in the crease because that will\u00a0\nmigrate down into your lashes so I look at my skin\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm like what do I need more discoloration\u00a0\nlike if I've been in the sun then I go with\u00a0\u00a0\neither I've been liking this one the\u00a0\ntopical brightening and clearing serum\u00a0\u00a0\nit smells like rotten eggs or sulfur\u00a0\nbut I don't know it's good it's very\u00a0\u00a0\nit takes a long time to work and I mean\u00a0\nit's okay it's gentle I can use it and one\u00a0\u00a0\nof my friends told me about this nandinola\u00a0\nI think it's like really cheap and you can\u00a0\u00a0\nget at Walmart and this is supposed to be like a\u00a0\nfading cream it has um hydroquinone I believe yeah\u00a0\u00a0\nso anyways I have I feel like I need a lighten\u00a0\nI use one of these I would you know I've tried\u00a0\u00a0\nlike so many things and I just have really\u00a0\nsensitive skin so if I go too hard then I get the\u00a0\u00a0\nopposite effect and it sucks right like I tried\u00a0\nretinol like prescription retinol um she's like\u00a0\u00a0\nso many things um if I need like more exfoliating\u00a0\nI'll use this ordinary lactic acid 10 percent\nthat's okay it ches a little bit but it's gentle\u00a0\nenough for because you leave it on all night and\u00a0\u00a0\nfor retinol I'm using this Neutrogena 0.5 power\u00a0\nserum I because this I could use this right\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom the start every day I don't know if it's\u00a0\nsuper effective or not because I've used like\u00a0\u00a0\npureology or archeology um yeah Trilogy their\u00a0\nlowest percentage of retinol and I could not\u00a0\u00a0\nuse that every single day I had to like use\u00a0\nit like once a week or every three days so\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know I mean I like it I use it\u00a0\nI think today I will go in with the top\n10 damage you know baseball all season and I'm\u00a0\noutside in the sun again so I just get a small\u00a0\u00a0\namount and then I Pat in it especially the\u00a0\nparts that I needed the most cheeks and then\u00a0\u00a0\nchin and Ice put it everywhere but I try to like\u00a0\nconcentrate it on the areas with the most damage\u00a0\u00a0\nsome damage like I have some damage here but I\u00a0\ncouldn't laser that off because it's above my eye\nlike when I did I film one time\u00a0\u00a0\nbring it down your neck and then I don't know I'm\u00a0\nnot like just so you know this is just what I do\num I always will use this and this is just the\u00a0\nOlay Richard nurse micro sculpting cream and I\u00a0\u00a0\nlike this because it's a good moisturizer and it\u00a0\nhas some retinol that I can use every day I can\u00a0\u00a0\nuse this morning and night and my skin doesn't do\u00a0\nanything so why not get a little bit of retinol\u00a0\u00a0\nI know you're not supposed to mix with certain\u00a0\nthings but I haven't had any reactions with this\u00a0\u00a0\nso I don't know maybe it's really with retinol\u00a0\nI don't know but it works and it's a good\u00a0\u00a0\nmoisturizer and my neck can tolerate it oh my gosh\u00a0\nmy neck can be so sensitive once I put retinol\u00a0\u00a0\non my neck and it was like burning red never\u00a0\nagain so I did kind of go over my eyebrows with\u00a0\u00a0\nmy skincare which I was I got carried\u00a0\naway so I just have a alcohol pad right\u00a0\u00a0\nnow it was just right here so I'm\u00a0\njust gonna wipe over it real quick\nand let it dry okay so now I'm gonna go in\u00a0\nwith the brow tint and this is a total like\u00a0\u00a0\nfirst impression so sorry if I do it wrong\u00a0\nlet's read the directions after cleaning\u00a0\u00a0\napply a liberal amount to remove the pack easily I\u00a0\nthink that's very important if you ever did a peel\u00a0\u00a0\noff mask you gotta use a thick layer dry for\u00a0\nat least two hours apply before going to bed\u00a0\u00a0\nat night and remove the next morning for stronger\u00a0\ncoloration after drying completely we move slowly\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom the tail do not remove forcibly and do not\u00a0\nuse a clean cleansing product for 24 hours after\nOkay so this is what it looks like it's\u00a0\nkind of like a thick gel looks pretty dark\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm gonna try to do a light\u00a0\nlayer first and then thicken it up\u00a0\u00a0\njust so I don't scare myself and\u00a0\nI'm gonna do my whole eyebrow\noh my gosh it's so dark\nmy kids are gonna freak out\ngoing in with a second layer\u00a0\nto make it nice and thick\nso the awesome part about having tattooed brows\u00a0\neven though they're faded is they really give you\u00a0\u00a0\na line of where you know your brow products should\u00a0\nbe and that's why I haven't done it recently\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause after I put on all my skincare and makeup\u00a0\nfoundation and all that sunscreen I have to draw\u00a0\u00a0\nmy brows anyways even when my tattoo is like\u00a0\ndark so I just kind of do it for an outline\nI really hope that's thick enough oh my\u00a0\ngosh I don't even know what I look like\nso I'm just getting a Q-tip in\u00a0\ncleaning out like the very tail end\nso I guess I'll be back in two hours\num yeah\nof all the videos I'm gonna do first\u00a0\nit's gonna be this one all right\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so it's been a little over two hours\u00a0\nit's 9 30 right now and I am ready to take\u00a0\u00a0\nthese things off like if it works really well\u00a0\nmaybe I wouldn't mind leaving on longer but\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm a little scared so I said to take it\u00a0\noff from the tail end and do it gently\nI really don't want to pull up any of\u00a0\nmy eyebrow hair so okay nice and slow\nand it's not when but it's very like stretchy\u00a0\u00a0\nso so far no hair has come off which is\u00a0\ngood I'm checking but wow it's kind of dark\nthe lady at the store said I could also\u00a0\nwash it off if I wanted to with warm water\nso so far no eyebrow hair has come off but that is\u00a0\npretty dark it actually looks pretty good I mean\u00a0\u00a0\nit looks like I got my eyebrows tattooed again\u00a0\nlike freshly tattooed said oh she don't mind I\u00a0\u00a0\nwouldn't mind if I made a mistake though so make\u00a0\nsure when you're applying it that you're doing\u00a0\u00a0\nit very well because it is gonna be pretty dark\u00a0\nand I'm sure it's gonna fade like in a day or two\nand this puppy why they say not to wash\u00a0\nit off immediately or for 24 hours and I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink this is the only way you can like not\u00a0\nwash your face for a while like do it right\u00a0\u00a0\nafter you take a shower and then leave it on\u00a0\nand then peel it off but I I have to still\u00a0\u00a0\nI can give it like 12 hours but maybe not like\u00a0\n24. who doesn't wash their face like 24 hours\nlike the peeling is way better than\u00a0\nI thought if it was like a face mask\u00a0\u00a0\npeel like that would not be good for your eyebrow\u00a0\nhairs but really so it did the same did come off\u00a0\u00a0\nof my hand a little bit I think it would look a\u00a0\nlot better if when I had makeup on because that's\u00a0\u00a0\nthe only thing that when I have freshly done\u00a0\ntattoos it's so dark with no makeup but with\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup it's perfect so you know you can't\u00a0\nhave both so yeah I I'm kind of loving it\u00a0\u00a0\nit does work better or darker than the the\u00a0\nfour tip one the four tip one is lighter you\u00a0\u00a0\ncould wear it out it's shiny but you could wear\u00a0\nit out and the stain last like maybe two days\u00a0\u00a0\nso it's not as dark the same mask yeah I think\u00a0\nthis is actually pretty good and I think I can\u00a0\u00a0\nincorporate it into my weekly routine\u00a0\nyou know two hours of cartoon eyebrows\u00a0\u00a0\num but yeah I will update you and let you\u00a0\nknow maybe I'll take some photos and put at\u00a0\u00a0\nthe end of the video like day one tomorrow\u00a0\nand then so on until it's fully worn off\u00a0\u00a0\nbut yeah thanks for watching my eyebrow tint and\u00a0\nPM skincare routine if you have any questions\u00a0\u00a0\num let me know down below and I'll try to link\u00a0\nall the products if I can in the description\u00a0\u00a0\nbut yeah thanks for watching please subscribe\u00a0\nand I'll see you in my next video [Music]\nthank you [Music]",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on. It just makes me look at them differently.**",

guys zoomed in we're just\u00a0\ngonna go ahead and start out by talking about\u00a0\u00a0\nthe product so it's a soft Contour cream there\u00a0\nwere a few different shades but I got the Shady\u00a0\u00a0\nGetty I really like Tower 28 as well I'm going\u00a0\nto list down below in the description box on\u00a0\u00a0\nhow much it was and the link to it so we're just\u00a0\ngoing to go ahead and open her up cute packaging\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom Tower 28 so typical packaging this is\u00a0\nthe exact same packaging as their blush so\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is really really nice I'm just going to go\u00a0\nin with what I typically would use for the blush\u00a0\u00a0\nI went ahead and washed my brush that I would\u00a0\nusually use that for I'm just going to try it\u00a0\u00a0\nwith the Contour doesn't come with a mirror\u00a0\nthat's the only downfall so I'm going to have\u00a0\u00a0\nto pull out a mirror and what I'm going to\u00a0\ndo is I'm basically just going to tap this\u00a0\u00a0\non my brush and I have a feeling it's going\u00a0\nto be just like the blush but we're going to\u00a0\u00a0\ntest that out as well and we're just going to\u00a0\nput this oh yeah this is going to be gorgeous\nand we're just going to contour and bronze with\u00a0\nthis if I can tell you I love their blush formula\u00a0\u00a0\nso much that I had a feeling I was actually\u00a0\nreally gonna like this and I'm sorry if you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan see my skin I'm super smart so I'm peeling\u00a0\nbut I absolutely love how this is sitting on the\u00a0\u00a0\nskin that was like wow okay this is very very\u00a0\npretty I love the shade too this is just like\u00a0\u00a0\nan excellent shade if you're closer to my skin\u00a0\ntype the shade Getty is really really nice I\u00a0\u00a0\nreally really really like this product it really\u00a0\njust sunk into the skin pretty much immediately\nand I just love the way this is sitting on the\u00a0\nskin this might be a new favorite so this is a\u00a0\u00a0\nvery quick and straight to the point review but\u00a0\nI did have a huge feeling that I was really going\u00a0\u00a0\nto like this I just love the color of this I love\u00a0\nthe way it sits on the skin I do really like this\u00a0\u00a0\nand I typically can tell right away if I'm gonna\u00a0\nreally like a product and this is definitely one\u00a0\u00a0\nof those products that immediately I was just\u00a0\nlike yes this is the product this is going to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe so good I love this I obviously I'm gonna have\u00a0\nto see how it wears and if anything changes I will\u00a0\u00a0\nupdate the description box but so far so good\u00a0\nreally really do recommend this product if you\u00a0\u00a0\nlike their blushes they're going to like this it's\u00a0\nthe exact same thing but it's just for contour and\u00a0\u00a0\nbronzer we're actually going to go in we're just\u00a0\ngoing to do a little Tower 28 haul here we're\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to go in with the blush shade magic hour\u00a0\nand we are just going to put that on the cheeks\u00a0\u00a0\nas well is I literally feel like this is the exact\u00a0\nsame formula just the color is for bronzer and\u00a0\u00a0\nor Contour because these literally are almost\u00a0\nidentical and you can see just how pretty the\u00a0\u00a0\nblush shade is too you can't go wrong with these\u00a0\nfrom Tower 28 they have a really creamy creamy\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel to them it's a really creamy formula too and\u00a0\nit just Blends and looks so pretty on the skin\nlove the blushes too I do recommend those\u00a0\nwe're gonna go in with the tower 28 their\u00a0\u00a0\nnew uh juice bombs I did a video on\u00a0\nthese These are absolutely incredible\u00a0\u00a0\nI just like Tower 28 as a brand in general I\u00a0\ntypically really really like their products\u00a0\u00a0\nand I love their juice bombs too just a really\u00a0\nreally good brand from Sephora that I think is\u00a0\u00a0\nworth trying and definitely worth your money all\u00a0\nright guys I know this was a short review but this\u00a0\u00a0\nis actually really really good I do recommend\u00a0\nthis this is the more matte formula they have\u00a0\u00a0\nanother one that is a little bit more luminous\u00a0\nbut this is their brand new one so I am curious\u00a0\u00a0\nto know the difference between the lumeness\u00a0\nand the matte obviously it's the Finish but I\u00a0\u00a0\nwonder if I would like that one just as much as\u00a0\nI like this one so I might pick that one up and\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe do a comparison if you want to see that\u00a0\ndefinitely leave down in the comments below 10\u00a0\u00a0\nout of 10 recommend this product so far like I\u00a0\nsaid if anything changes I will leave down in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

                "comment": "Sorry for the long comment in advance!!  I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

She lies about the false lashes and then didn&#39;t respond about it at all and she hid the sponsored statement and doubled down on her lies and made a joke out of her actions in subsequent videos. She has used filters too.  She has yet to apologize and she shouldn&#39;t be given the benefit of the doubt at all. That ship sailed.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I do believe I've already done a first\u00a0\u00a0\nimpressions on this particular foundation and I\u00a0\nbelieve I've showcased all of the products that\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm going to be showcasing today from her brand\u00a0\nalready but I want to kind of just talk about\u00a0\u00a0\nsome things while we're showcasing so the reason\u00a0\nthat I love to kind of showcase black owned Brands\u00a0\u00a0\nduring this month is because there are some Brands\u00a0\nI find people don't actually know are black owned\u00a0\u00a0\nand they also because they didn't know about that\u00a0\nthey may have felt one way or another about the\u00a0\u00a0\nbrand maybe their color range or whatever have you\u00a0\nbecause of that I do definitely think that color\u00a0\u00a0\nrange has been in skin tone range especially when\u00a0\nit comes to base products has just been a very\u00a0\u00a0\na very controversial topic um throughout the\u00a0\nyears and mainly because a lot of those bigger\u00a0\u00a0\neasier accessible Brands were not allowing\u00a0\npeople of my skin tone or even halfway deeper\u00a0\u00a0\nto try their products and if you're somebody\u00a0\nwho goes to the drugstore or goes to Sephora\u00a0\u00a0\nUlta there should be a decent amount of brands\u00a0\nthat allow you to even potentially purchase from\u00a0\u00a0\nthem that said not every brand has to be person\u00a0\nof color friendly I have come to realize that\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'm perfectly fine with that and that is\u00a0\nwhere I just strictly honestly if I go to a\u00a0\u00a0\nlocation and I find that there is not one brand\u00a0\nthat is person of color friendly I'm asking for\u00a0\u00a0\nthe black owned brand because I know that brand\u00a0\nis going to be there for people of complexion\u00a0\u00a0\npeople of you know medium to deep complexion so\u00a0\nanyways this is the sublime skin Foundation I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink just as she has talked about this Foundation\u00a0\ngives a very skin like finish and that's saying\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething for somebody who currently has not\u00a0\nbeen using their skincare for the last week\u00a0\u00a0\nnot because I am sad although I am sad it is\u00a0\nmainly because I ran out of my skincare ran out\u00a0\u00a0\nof it completely and the shipment that I ordered\u00a0\nof skincare to you know replenish and I mean I\u00a0\u00a0\nran out of pretty much everything when it comes\u00a0\nto my skincare except for like my oil cleanser\u00a0\u00a0\num and maybe like my normal cleanser everything\u00a0\nelse I'm pretty much out of it just hasn't come\u00a0\u00a0\nto me and so I'm trying to work around it so today\u00a0\nas like my skincare I actually went ahead and used\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Peach and Lily glass skin Veil Mist I believe\u00a0\nI've already reviewed this for you all basically\u00a0\u00a0\nthey say that you can use this as a finishing\u00a0\nspray or as a skincare agent and so I just went\u00a0\u00a0\nahead and used it today more as a moisturizer\u00a0\nbecause I just don't have one so um yeah I just\u00a0\u00a0\nreally enjoy going to Black owned Brands and yeah\u00a0\nI just want to continue to support and promote\u00a0\u00a0\nthem for those who don't know about them and\u00a0\nas I said in January I will continue to promote\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent cultural Brands as their cultural months\u00a0\nbecome up in the year and they will be going based\u00a0\u00a0\non the U.S schedule I know different countries\u00a0\nhave different months that they celebrate for\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know different cultures so just bear with\u00a0\nme I live in the US so this is the schedule\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I'm gonna be going with next I just applied\u00a0\nthe concealer from her range and this is her skin\u00a0\u00a0\nfetish Sublime perfecting concealer I have this in\u00a0\nthe shade md26 I believe that's the shade um and\u00a0\u00a0\nI've been testing this out quite a bit lately it\u00a0\nhas been pretty much the go-to concealer that I'll\u00a0\u00a0\nreach for since I tried it in my first impressions\u00a0\nand I was surprised um I typically don't like full\u00a0\u00a0\ncoverage concealers because I don't need a lot\u00a0\nof coverage it's just not something for me um I'm\u00a0\u00a0\na hardcore medium coverage type girl and I also\u00a0\nalways found that when it came to full coverage\u00a0\u00a0\nthey were just so cakey and covering up and I\u00a0\njust I didn't like it I didn't like it at all\u00a0\u00a0\num but this concealer it still sticks with that\u00a0\nskin like finish skin-like base This truly to me\u00a0\u00a0\nlooks like skin and if I were to go out um I don't\u00a0\nthink people would know that I'm actually wearing\u00a0\u00a0\nfoundation and concealer which is one of the best\u00a0\npositives I find with this particular bass system\u00a0\u00a0\num I will continue to Showcase all of the other\u00a0\nproducts that I have from her and there are\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely some positives from her particular\u00a0\nrange and those two products I have come to\u00a0\u00a0\nfind are genuine genuine positives that if you\u00a0\nneed a foundation or concealer cream granted\u00a0\u00a0\nI would tell you to wait like I did I got both of\u00a0\nthose for 40 off along with this next product so\u00a0\u00a0\nI would definitely tell you to wait towards\u00a0\nthat but if for whatever reason you really\u00a0\u00a0\nreally need something now and you really want\u00a0\nto get a skin like face like this I'd highly\u00a0\u00a0\nrecommend them so the next product that I want to\u00a0\ngo ahead and highlight from her range is actually\u00a0\u00a0\nher under eye setting powder the long name is\u00a0\nactually the skin fetish Sublime perfecting\u00a0\u00a0\nblurring under eye powder and this is a really\u00a0\ngood powder so I've tried it with a couple of\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent brushes if memory serves me correctly\u00a0\nI know I've tried it with this rougher 18 brush\u00a0\u00a0\nthat might not be the real number I think this\u00a0\nis a prototype I went through a phase where I\u00a0\u00a0\npicked up quite a few of their prototypes I've\u00a0\nalso tried it with a similar brush to this one\u00a0\u00a0\nthe only difference is that this is synthetic\u00a0\nwhereas this is natural hair I'm gonna go ahead\u00a0\u00a0\nand stick with this one for right now because\u00a0\nI don't see the equivalent that is synthetic\u00a0\u00a0\num that I used I just don't see it but anyways oh\u00a0\nit might be over here I'm not dealing with that so\u00a0\u00a0\none thing I will say in note is that it took me\u00a0\na little while to get over like there was like\u00a0\u00a0\nan overspray that was kind of like protecting\u00a0\nthe product if you will and because of that\u00a0\u00a0\nI didn't really set my Foundation or my concealer\u00a0\nthat first time I tried this product it just was\u00a0\u00a0\nnot coming up and that's because you really have\u00a0\nto break through that seal to kind of get the\u00a0\u00a0\nthe product I don't I don't really know how to\u00a0\nsay it but what I find is that this product is\u00a0\u00a0\neffortless and you really don't see it on the skin\u00a0\nyou really don't see it now do you see that the\u00a0\u00a0\nmiddle part of my face is no longer as glowy as\u00a0\nit was of course but it still pretty much looks\u00a0\u00a0\nlike skin and for that I really really do like\u00a0\nthis product is this something that I would say\u00a0\u00a0\nis a must-have no I feel like you can get a very\u00a0\nsimilar product from other brands that are cheaper\u00a0\u00a0\nonce again I did pay for it with the 40 off so\u00a0\nI'm perfectly content this is a good product and\u00a0\u00a0\nI would recommend it but is it something\u00a0\nthat you have to pick up no I don't think\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me just put a blanket here none of this\u00a0\nyou have to pick up I'm just gonna give you\u00a0\u00a0\nmy pros and cons to the brand now the biggest\u00a0\ncon for me is she doesn't have a bronzer ma'am\u00a0\u00a0\nma'am we've been waiting for bronzers for years\u00a0\nnow so I'm just gonna speed through my little\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of everyday bronze routine that I've been\u00a0\ndoing lately which is the abh cream bronzer and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen the makeup Revolution um powder bronzer but\u00a0\nyeah I really need her to get a bronzer because\u00a0\u00a0\nI love bronzer and lately I\u00a0\nhaven't been feeling motivated\u00a0\u00a0\nby any new bronzers so I would love for Pat to be\u00a0\nthe person to like and get me motivated again you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow but anyways I'm just gonna blend this cream\u00a0\nbronzer in and then set it with the powder okay\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm back brows and bronzer are done because I\u00a0\ndon't have any well she doesn't have any bronzing\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts and I also just don't have any brow\u00a0\nproducts I don't think she has any though but\u00a0\u00a0\nthe cheeks are another area where I think Pat\u00a0\nMcGrath really shines so I do want to go ahead\u00a0\u00a0\nand showcase a couple of different products that\u00a0\nI have from her I do have a holiday palette that\u00a0\u00a0\nshe released I want to say it now two holidays\u00a0\nago and one of my favorite things to do with\u00a0\u00a0\nthis particular palette is to literally combine\u00a0\nthese two shades together the middle one is Paris\u00a0\u00a0\nVenus the outside one is a Love Struck I love them\u00a0\nboth I've worn them both by themselves I've worn\u00a0\u00a0\nthem as I said conjunctively I found my favorite\u00a0\ncream blush brush I'm sorry um so um I've worn\u00a0\u00a0\nthem together I've worn them separately and I\u00a0\njust enjoy everything about this palette I love\u00a0\u00a0\nthat this palette is kind of a One-Stop shop for\u00a0\nmy cheeks because I can do blush and highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\nwith this palette I won't be using the highlighter\u00a0\nin this particular palette but it is really good\u00a0\u00a0\nand it is the shade Venus nectar she tends to\u00a0\nkind of re-release that shade during holidays\u00a0\u00a0\nand such so if you haven't tried it before and you\u00a0\nwant to don't worry I promise you she will release\u00a0\u00a0\na palette or a product so you can try it in the\u00a0\nfuture so definitely definitely highly recommend\u00a0\u00a0\nher blushes I also have one of the blushes that\u00a0\nis like the two-toned one I absolutely love that\u00a0\u00a0\nblush too so overall I definitely would recommend\u00a0\na blush from her once again get it on a sale she\u00a0\u00a0\nwas one of the brands that I actually featured in\u00a0\nmy I will never buy full priced video because I\u00a0\u00a0\njust genuinely don't think you should ever buy her\u00a0\nstuff full price unless you're a reviewer and even\u00a0\u00a0\nme as a reviewer because I guess you can consider\u00a0\nme of your reviewer I don't really buy her stuff\u00a0\u00a0\nfull price I just wait get my review out later\u00a0\nwhen I've had the product tested it out that's\u00a0\u00a0\njust my two cents you do with that as you will but\u00a0\nanother highlighting product that I really want to\u00a0\u00a0\num highlight today is actually this baby\u00a0\nright here now this particular shade is no\u00a0\u00a0\nlonger available this is what this was from the\u00a0\nBridgerton collection at least I don't think it's\u00a0\u00a0\navailable I think she already kind of discontinued\u00a0\nthe Bridgeton collection this particular one is\u00a0\u00a0\nincandescent O2 gold I absolutely love it I\u00a0\nthink that it just bounces off my skin tone\u00a0\u00a0\nin the really really a nice way I know that\u00a0\nit looks really scary in pan and what I have\u00a0\u00a0\nfound is that the Shadows or what I found is that\u00a0\nthe highlighters that look really scary in pan\u00a0\u00a0\nas long as they have that gold base to them I can\u00a0\ngenerally finesse it to make it work and to really\u00a0\u00a0\nwork well on my skin tone and now you guys can see\u00a0\nit even better this is a very similar shade to the\u00a0\u00a0\nPatrick Star no Patrick Star one size highlighter\u00a0\nthat he did with Fantasia so in the event that you\u00a0\u00a0\ndid not you weren't able to pick that up because\u00a0\nI think now it is only available in certain stores\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is also another alternative if this is\u00a0\neven available I will do my absolute best to\u00a0\u00a0\nlink everything down below that is available if\u00a0\nit isn't I'm sorry but these are the things that\u00a0\u00a0\nI have so those are the cheeks I really like them\u00a0\nI am going to go ahead and spray one more time\njust because of the fact that I put all\u00a0\nthose powders on I want those powders to\u00a0\u00a0\nreally seep into my skin and kind of become one\u00a0\nso that it looks even more skin like but really\u00a0\u00a0\nI will be going further in at the end but I\u00a0\ndefinitely recommend those things now I got\u00a0\u00a0\na little sidetracked but I do want to talk\u00a0\nabout my intentions for purchasing in 2023\u00a0\u00a0\nand I do have some lofty goals we'll see how it\u00a0\nworks but for the months that I can attain it I\u00a0\u00a0\ndo want to be able to do that and basically\u00a0\none of the biggest goals that I want to do\u00a0\u00a0\nis like let's say in the month of February I want\u00a0\nto buy a foundation to showcase for you all I only\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to buy one foundation in the whole month\u00a0\nbecause I find for a couple of different reasons\u00a0\u00a0\none that limits me to hopefully only introducing\u00a0\n12 products in each category this whole year\u00a0\u00a0\nbut also because of the fact that I don't wear\u00a0\nmakeup enough I feel to really be able to review\u00a0\u00a0\nas quickly as I personally would like now granted\u00a0\nthat's all relative not everybody has the feeling\u00a0\u00a0\nthat you have to review so quickly or whatever\u00a0\nwhatever I just like to kind of get my thoughts\u00a0\u00a0\nget my opinions and then clean my space my space\u00a0\nhas been quite busy and quite cluttered with all\u00a0\u00a0\nof my little baskets with all of these things that\u00a0\nI want to review and test out in different phases\u00a0\u00a0\nand it's been a lot for me to mentally keep track\u00a0\nof so this is a reason among others that I want to\u00a0\u00a0\ndo that also the financial reason of course right\u00a0\none of the various things that have been holding\u00a0\u00a0\nme back when it comes to really making some of the\u00a0\nsteps that I wish to make in my personal life is\u00a0\u00a0\nthe financial aspect now I've been slowly I feel\u00a0\nlike doing better this year on you know saving and\u00a0\u00a0\nreally just prioritizing if I'm gonna buy this\u00a0\nthen I can't buy that you know just remembering\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can't buy everything and to kind of continue\u00a0\nto fortify that I want to limit the amount of\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup that I have I have so much makeup and\u00a0\ndon't get me wrong I enjoy every little piece\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I continue to keep into my collection but I'm\u00a0\nalso finding that I'm interested in so many other\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent aspects of my life that maybe previously\u00a0\nI wasn't and so to maybe purchase in those Avenues\u00a0\u00a0\nI want to ensure that I'm not over purchasing\u00a0\neverywhere you can't do it not financially at\u00a0\u00a0\nleast not with my wallet it's just not possible\u00a0\nand so that's the biggest thing for me I just\u00a0\u00a0\nthink I'm gonna try to limit myself which quite\u00a0\nliterally means one eyeshadow palette which\u00a0\u00a0\nfun fact I was able to actually do that\u00a0\nthe only eyeshadow palette that I picked\u00a0\u00a0\nup in the whole month of January was the one\u00a0\nfrom Adept yes I am considering pre-ordered\u00a0\u00a0\nitems as like a part of this challenge\u00a0\nas well so we'll see how well I do\u00a0\u00a0\num and I think I can do it but who knows\u00a0\nanyways I'm using my Pat McGrath Divine Rose\u00a0\u00a0\n2 palette and I just went into the like more\u00a0\npeachy tone I really love that shade I think\u00a0\u00a0\nit's really really pretty and now let's see if I\u00a0\ncan find a brush that I need to clean not as bad\u00a0\u00a0\nokay this is one I think this is from give me\u00a0\nglow I don't particularly love these brushes but\u00a0\u00a0\nit's a brush okay and at this time and day I need\u00a0\na brush that works so I'm gonna go into the purple\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'm just gonna kind of deepen out my look so\u00a0\nyeah that's pretty much that as for Pat McGrath\u00a0\u00a0\nand like her eyeshadows I think that her eyeshadow\u00a0\npalette quality is good I really do I prefer her\u00a0\u00a0\nmats in the grand scheme of things and I also\u00a0\nenjoy her metallics and shimmers specifically\u00a0\u00a0\nwe're talking about the mothership I really\u00a0\nenjoy the four in the quad of course everybody\u00a0\u00a0\nenjoys that that's why she continues to get people\u00a0\nbuying these products for the price that they are\u00a0\u00a0\nbut if we're comparing both of her formulas\u00a0\ncompared to like all of the other formulas in\u00a0\u00a0\nmy collection those aren't going to really do\u00a0\nit these do it if I'm comparing her to other\u00a0\u00a0\nSephora based Brands and like other just like\u00a0\nbigger Market Brands but if we're talking about\u00a0\u00a0\nmy Indie shadows and my Indie Brands as much as I\u00a0\nenjoy those four sparkly glittery Shadows they're\u00a0\u00a0\njust not going to do anything they're not going to\u00a0\nhold a candle and so that is what I would say if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou're somebody like me who you enjoy Indy and\u00a0\nyou have a lot of Indie and you maybe haven't\u00a0\u00a0\ntried Pat McGrath or you've tried it and you just\u00a0\ndon't know if you should get anything else I would\u00a0\u00a0\nsay if you can find a similar if not exact same\u00a0\ncolor story from an independently owned brand\u00a0\u00a0\nthat you enjoy their formula get the brands get\u00a0\nthat other brand because her stuff is it's nice\u00a0\u00a0\nit is nice don't get me to Lion but at the\u00a0\nend of the day it's nothing groundbreaking\u00a0\u00a0\nnothing extravagant I really do like her map\u00a0\nformula though I think this is a really good\u00a0\u00a0\nformula it's really nice it builds it blends it's\u00a0\npigmented which I would expect nothing less seeing\u00a0\u00a0\nas Pat McGrath is black but also because she is a\u00a0\nmakeup artist so you know typically makeup artist\u00a0\u00a0\nI feel like really are good at ensuring that\u00a0\nproducts work for a wide range regardless of\u00a0\u00a0\ntheir skin tone so yeah I mean that's pretty much\u00a0\nthat I know some people have also had tried her\u00a0\u00a0\neyeshadow primer and they did not enjoy\u00a0\nit I've never tried it I didn't feel the\u00a0\u00a0\nneed I'm not somebody who feels the need to\u00a0\ntry eyeshadow primer after eyeshadow primer\u00a0\u00a0\num and I found one that I love in another that\u00a0\nI think is okay along with some others so I just\u00a0\u00a0\nI just don't feel the need to try her eyeshadow\u00a0\nformula or her eyeshadow primer formula and I\u00a0\u00a0\njust don't think I'm ever going to okay I think\u00a0\nI was doing too much for the very basic eye look\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I have going on all right so for these\u00a0\nfour Shadows I actually was using this for\u00a0\u00a0\na while as a highlighter that's another tip\u00a0\nif you want to get some Pat McGrath but you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan't afford to get every little bit in Bob\u00a0\nget a palette that you can use multi-purpose\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause her Shadows you can do that along with\u00a0\nany other Shadow but just because the pans are\u00a0\u00a0\nso big it's easier to do that so like I would be\u00a0\neasily able to fit my normal highlighter brush\u00a0\u00a0\ninto this pan and that's what I did I literally\u00a0\nused it as a highlighter for quite some time\u00a0\u00a0\num let's just go with that I know the shadow I\u00a0\nknow it works I'm pretty sure I've literally done\u00a0\u00a0\nthis eyeshadow look on my channel before but\u00a0\nyou know if it ain't broke don't fix it okay\u00a0\u00a0\num so yeah I really like her formula but is\u00a0\nit something that I feel I have to recommend\u00a0\u00a0\nthat you have to pick up because you can't get\u00a0\nit anywhere no no it's not and if we're being\u00a0\u00a0\nhonest none of this stuff is as much as I am\u00a0\ngonna of course recommend certain products as\u00a0\u00a0\nI've done throughout this video I definitely will\u00a0\nsay that the drugstore is becoming something that\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can still get a skin like finish Foundation\u00a0\nconcealer all of that from a drugstore brand and\u00a0\u00a0\nso if you cannot afford Pat McGrath okay a lot\u00a0\nof people's finances are getting very interesting\u00a0\u00a0\nvery interesting then don't don't stress yourself\u00a0\nover trying to get a Pat McGrath product if you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan't I just to me it ain't worth it it ain't\u00a0\nworth it at all I'm gonna go into camo palette\u00a0\u00a0\nso darn big I'm gonna go into this like paler\u00a0\num gold Shimmer champagne in the corner and\u00a0\u00a0\nthis happens to be a blending brush it was the\u00a0\nfirst brush that looked clean that I knew would\u00a0\u00a0\nwork it's not when I would highly recommend\u00a0\nbut you know what it's getting the job done\u00a0\u00a0\nit is getting the job done so I'm going to hop off\u00a0\ncamera very very quickly I want to go ahead and\u00a0\u00a0\nline my eyes put on my mascara I don't have a Pat\u00a0\nMcGrath mascara I can't recommend it but I do know\u00a0\u00a0\nthat there's one mascara that like generally a lot\u00a0\nof people hate and the other one a lot of people\u00a0\u00a0\nlove so go to your favorite YouTuber to see which\u00a0\none is which especially if they've actually tried\u00a0\u00a0\nher mascaras I don't have a liner from her either\u00a0\nso I'm just going to use my black La girl one and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen I do have a lipstick from her so I'm going\u00a0\nto use some of my lipsticks in conjunction with\u00a0\u00a0\nanother lip liner so let me like prepare my face a\u00a0\nlittle bit further into the steps and then we can\u00a0\u00a0\ntop off some Pat McGrath and sit down sit back all\u00a0\nof that and really talk about the things that I\u00a0\u00a0\nwould really recommend and the things I would not\u00a0\nso recommend alrighty guys so I am now finished\u00a0\u00a0\nwith the eyes I'm gonna go lashless today and\u00a0\nthen you guys can see what I feel like is my best\u00a0\u00a0\nattempt using the abh mascara um I did go ahead\u00a0\nand line my lips with the IRL liner lip liner\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich is in the shade Americano Brown if for\u00a0\nwhatever reason your anti-makeup Revolution\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich I understand another lip liner that I\u00a0\nuse very much interchangeably with this one\u00a0\u00a0\nis from NYX and this is in the shade Mason so\u00a0\nI know um both of these are available at Ulta\u00a0\u00a0\nso I want to go ahead and do that I'll try my\u00a0\nbest to link both of these down below for you\u00a0\u00a0\nall in the event that you prefer one brand over\u00a0\nthe other I know a lot of you guys really enjoy\u00a0\u00a0\nmy lip combos so I'm trying to share the wisdom\u00a0\nshare the wealth anyways I have three lipsticks\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom Pat McGrath and I enjoy them all but these\u00a0\ntwo I don't think I've ever used this combination\u00a0\u00a0\nso I want to go ahead and do it today so\u00a0\nfirst what I'm going to do is put as like\u00a0\u00a0\nmy base or main shade as being Divine Brown It's\u00a0\na brown you knew I was gonna get it and enjoy it\nso that is divine Brown on my skin tone the\u00a0\npositive about this is that this isn't too\u00a0\u00a0\ndark compared to my skin tone so I don't feel\u00a0\nlike it's like as deep as like the Marc Jacobs\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich I didn't get a lot of use out of it's a very\u00a0\nskin not skin it's like a powder bishmat formula\u00a0\u00a0\nit's not overly drying which I appreciate and\u00a0\nit's very very soft I don't really feel like I\u00a0\u00a0\nhave anything on but the perfect undertone and\u00a0\nI actually prefer a lip product that's slightly\u00a0\u00a0\ncloser to my skin tone so I guess I've done\u00a0\nthis before I just haven't done it lately I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to top it off with the shade 1995 which\u00a0\nI feel is too light for my skin tone on its own\nthis has more of a pink tone to it but\u00a0\nI feel like that just lightened it up\u00a0\u00a0\nenough for me to just feel a little bit more\u00a0\nconfident in this particular shade I think it also\u00a0\u00a0\njust plays off nicely with the eyeshadows that\u00a0\nI have on my eyes so it just all comes together\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is the finished look this is my full\u00a0\nface of Pat McGrath let me come and see if you\u00a0\u00a0\nguys can see everything what it's looking like\u00a0\nreally up and close alrighty so this is my eyes\u00a0\u00a0\num it's look a little sketchy I think\u00a0\nit's mainly because of that mascara\u00a0\u00a0\nthis mascara is just chunky chunk City and I\u00a0\nliterally like cleared off the wand I'll be\u00a0\u00a0\ntalking about it soon in a video I just\u00a0\nhaven't gotten around to filming it yet\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen it comes to my forehead it looks really\u00a0\nreally nice but I don't have a lot of issues\u00a0\u00a0\nwith my forehead until hours in then we're getting\u00a0\nto the middle of my face you can really see how\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful that blush and highlighter blend\u00a0\ntogether especially with my bronzer being\u00a0\u00a0\nof a different brand sometimes Brands can have\u00a0\nissues like that you're seeing the foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nconcealer the powder all of it remember I didn't\u00a0\nput any powder here I didn't put any powder on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe outside edges this is just this is what she\u00a0\nlooks like when it comes to Pat McGrath for me I\u00a0\u00a0\nwould say stick with the base products if you\u00a0\nreally really want to bring some Pat McGrath\u00a0\u00a0\ninto your collection try her foundation try her\u00a0\nconcealer try her blushes and highlighters those\u00a0\u00a0\nare the four categories that I would say Dive\u00a0\nRight on in the other categories I think are\u00a0\u00a0\njust luxuries they're just add-ons bonuses if\u00a0\nyou will to her collection that if you are an\u00a0\u00a0\navid Pat McGrath fan you can have as much as\u00a0\nI do and more some people have a lot more more\u00a0\u00a0\nbut if you're not and you just want the really\u00a0\ngood gems those are what I would recommend the the\u00a0\u00a0\neyeshadow palette like I said I really do like it\u00a0\nI have quite a few eyeshadow palettes from her but\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't think that her formula specifically the\u00a0\nhigh the metallic and the like fancy shades are as\u00a0\u00a0\nend-all beagle that I did when they first came out\u00a0\nI've tried so many more independently owned Brands\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'm just saying once you go independently\u00a0\nowned you don't go back you really just don't but\u00a0\u00a0\num and then the lip product I\u00a0\nthink the lip products are fine\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I definitely know that you can get\u00a0\na very similar finish formula from Mac\u00a0\u00a0\num I think I also have some from independently\u00a0\nowned Brands I know I have some from the drugstore\u00a0\u00a0\nas well so this formula isn't all that pop in\u00a0\nif you will and I also just don't love any of\u00a0\u00a0\nthe shades that like I can just put one shade on\u00a0\nI feel like I have to always combine those two\u00a0\u00a0\nshades to get my perfect one and the other shade I\u00a0\nhave is a red I don't know why I picked it up but\u00a0\u00a0\nit's just sitting there in the corner waiting\u00a0\nfor me to eventually use it I do enjoy the powder\u00a0\u00a0\nalthough once again I just don't think that to\u00a0\nend all Beyond I feel like you could get another\u00a0\u00a0\npowder very similar from the drugstore so rounding\u00a0\nit up once again I highly recommend the foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nthe concealer the highlighters not this particular\u00a0\nrain because I don't think this range is still\u00a0\u00a0\navailable but highlighters nonetheless and then\u00a0\nher blushes all of her blushes I've tried both\u00a0\u00a0\nof the formulas I absolutely love them of course\u00a0\nthe one caveat in all of this make sure you get\u00a0\u00a0\nthe right shade if you don't get the right shade\u00a0\nit's not going to be it's not going to feel good\u00a0\u00a0\nfor you and although I felt like this was overly\u00a0\nrunny you guys let me know that is definitely her\u00a0\u00a0\nnormal formula so I did go ahead and keep it and\u00a0\nwhen I put it on my face and I did my full face\u00a0\u00a0\nit does look very much to match my skin tone so\u00a0\nI didn't feel I needed to change the actual color\u00a0\u00a0\num is there anything else I need to mention this\u00a0\nwhole video has been filmed with natural Lighting\u00a0\u00a0\nin front of me and my overhead ceiling light so\u00a0\nhopefully that gives you kind of some of the best\u00a0\u00a0\num perspectives on what these colors and these\u00a0\ntones look like on my skin tone along with like\u00a0\u00a0\nhow radiant and blinding some products are and\u00a0\nnot so much others but yeah I think that's all I\u00a0\u00a0\nhave for you guys I hope this was helpful um and\u00a0\nyeah I'll see you guys in my next video bye guys",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I fell for it too many times. <br><br>I\u2019ve heard a few Youtubers talk about products that they want to try but they wouldn\u2019t purchase and immediately turn around and ask the brand to send them it as PR. I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on. It just makes me look at them differently.**",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

She lies about the false lashes and then didn&#39;t respond about it at all and she hid the sponsored statement and doubled down on her lies and made a joke out of her actions in subsequent videos. She has used filters too.  She has yet to apologize and she shouldn&#39;t be given the benefit of the doubt at all. That ship sailed.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

        "transcript_text": "hey Beauties it's me Allegra I'm super excited\u00a0\ntoday because look what rare Beauty sent me I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nliterally I I can't even believe it you guys\u00a0\nthey've sent me this beautiful PR and it's just\u00a0\u00a0\nthe most gorgeous assortment in here of her\u00a0\nhighlighters these are the Selena Gomez rare\u00a0\u00a0\nBeauty highlighters and she sent four different\u00a0\nshades I believe so we'll Swatch those out today\u00a0\u00a0\nthey also sent this brush this is the positive\u00a0\nlight precision brush which you use to apply\u00a0\u00a0\nthe highlighters and then they also sent me this\u00a0\npositive light under eye brightener then they also\u00a0\u00a0\nsent this lip souffle so this is a lip souffle\u00a0\ncreme and so I can't wait to try it on and see\u00a0\u00a0\nyou guys I have my other rare Beauty lipstick\u00a0\nand I absolutely love it so let me go ahead and\u00a0\u00a0\nget started now those they did send me but this\u00a0\none I just purchased myself so this is the always\u00a0\u00a0\nan optimist poor diffusing primer so I figured\u00a0\nwe could try this out today and test it out for\u00a0\u00a0\nthe first time as well so let's see I don't smell\u00a0\nanything so I don't think it has any scent to it\u00a0\u00a0\nand oh okay let's I don't know let's look spiked\u00a0\nyou guys oh it feels really nice it does seem to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe it seems to be a hybrid between a serum and\u00a0\nkind of like one of those poor filling primers\u00a0\u00a0\nso actually it feels like a very light pore\u00a0\nfilling primer it does say that it's a poor\u00a0\u00a0\ndiffusing primer so hopefully that's case\u00a0\nbecause I do have quite a bit of pores but\u00a0\u00a0\nmy initial impression is that it feels so good and\u00a0\nit definitely does feel like a lightweight version\u00a0\u00a0\nof those kind of silicone primers of that kind of\u00a0\nbenefit porefessional it feels something like that\u00a0\u00a0\ntype of texture but super light in comparison\u00a0\nit almost feels gel like on my skin so it feels\u00a0\u00a0\nso good I feel it drawing down so let's see what\u00a0\nhappens when it dries down because it does feel\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it's kind of turning a little bit mattified\u00a0\nmaybe even I'm not sure I feel like my skin looks\u00a0\u00a0\nso much smoother it definitely feels super soft\u00a0\nto the touch and the pores definitely look reduced\u00a0\u00a0\nbut let's put the makeup on top because that's\u00a0\nwhen I really see a huge difference when I apply\u00a0\u00a0\nthe makeup on top of the primer but already I can\u00a0\nI can definitely see a difference so now the next\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct that I have to try here is the positive\u00a0\nlight under eye brightener now they said that you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan wear this under your makeup for a no makeup\u00a0\nmakeup look or you can apply this on top of your\u00a0\u00a0\nconcealer for that ultimate brightening effect\u00a0\nI'm going to try it both ways and let's see what\u00a0\u00a0\nhappens so here it is beautiful packaging okay I\u00a0\nhad heard about this they said there's you know\u00a0\u00a0\nthe rollerball at the end and some some people\u00a0\nwere saying they like it and some people don't but\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me go ahead and give it a try it definitely\u00a0\nis cold so it's cooling and will definitely have\u00a0\u00a0\nthat puffing benefit so it definitely does feel\u00a0\nreally good and does seem to be working even as\u00a0\u00a0\na concealer because I have a lot of under eye\u00a0\nbrighteners and they're not always this opaque\u00a0\u00a0\nsometimes they're more sheer generally the ones\u00a0\nthat I've tried are more sheer so this one does\u00a0\u00a0\nseem to have more coverage than the other under\u00a0\neye brighteners that I have so I'm just going to\u00a0\u00a0\ngo ahead and tap it in let me just go ahead and\u00a0\nuse my finger oh wow so it definitely melted into\u00a0\u00a0\nmy under eye area pretty much immediately it's not\u00a0\ndry so it's not tugging on my under eye it's very\u00a0\u00a0\ncreamy and smooth so it actually does almost even\u00a0\nfeel like an eye cream it's beautiful wow awesome\u00a0\u00a0\nexpecting that you guys seriously this is a lot\u00a0\nof coverage usually I do color correct so this\u00a0\u00a0\nactually color correct I don't feel like I need\u00a0\nthe color correctors what I'm trying to say wow\u00a0\u00a0\nit's very soothing so it's not like a concealer\u00a0\nand so many concealers just tug your under eye\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're kind of dry in texture this feels like an\u00a0\neye cream and it just concealed like a concealer\u00a0\u00a0\nhow amazing is that yeah I could definitely see\u00a0\ngoing out like this and feeling you know like you\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't need any other makeup this is that that's\u00a0\ndefinitely why they said it's a no makeup makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nproduct s so should I eat I don't even want\u00a0\nto put on any more makeup guys this feels so\u00a0\u00a0\ngood it's crazy I do have to hear my rare Beauty\u00a0\nFoundation though actually this looks kind of deep\u00a0\u00a0\nfor me now I have the Tinted Moisturizer uh what\u00a0\ndo you guys think this is the positively attention\u00a0\u00a0\nshould I put maybe I'll put a little okay let's\u00a0\nput a little bit of this on just so I can see\u00a0\u00a0\nhow it sits with the primer so this is just the\u00a0\ntinted moisturizer it's pretty this doesn't have\u00a0\u00a0\nSPF 20 in it and very lightweight does give you\u00a0\na glow I've been wearing this for a while and I\u00a0\u00a0\nlove it this primer definitely did a lot for my\u00a0\nskin because normally I don't feel comfortable\u00a0\u00a0\nwith just a tinted moisturizer on but because\u00a0\nthe primer did so much to disguise the pores and\u00a0\u00a0\nsmooth my skin that the Tinted Moisturizer is just\u00a0\na perfect match if you don't feel like you need\u00a0\u00a0\nmore coverage or you know trying a lot of times\u00a0\nI use Foundation to kind of smooth my skin and\u00a0\u00a0\ndisguise the pores but this primer did it already\u00a0\nwithout a foundation so that's really amazing\u00a0\u00a0\nso I had been seeing a lot of people online use\u00a0\ntheir rare Beauty blush and they put it on before\u00a0\u00a0\nthe concealer so I do have my concealer here\u00a0\nalso from rare Beauty it's almost out but

that into my skin yeah I\u00a0\nthink I I kind of I did put too much but the thing\u00a0\u00a0\nabout it is that you can put the concealer on top\u00a0\nand it takes down the blush and then what winds up\u00a0\u00a0\nhappening is the blush peeks out from under the\u00a0\nconcealer and it just makes the most gorgeous\u00a0\u00a0\nglow yes I'll just take the concealer now and\u00a0\nlet's go ahead

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

        "transcript_text": "hey guys and welcome back to my channel so in\u00a0\ntoday's video this is part four of my series\u00a0\u00a0\ntrying out the best selling Foundations at Sephora\u00a0\ndolls we are almost halfway there there's only two\u00a0\u00a0\nmore foundations to go and we're done with the\u00a0\nseries and on this video we are going to try\u00a0\u00a0\non another long wearing Foundation this is the\u00a0\nCharlotte tilbury's airbrush Flawless Foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nsorry guys if my voice is very husky I just got\u00a0\nout from a cold and I'm still coughing a lot but\u00a0\u00a0\nI really wanna go through this series because it's\u00a0\nvery very exciting for me so let's just pretend\u00a0\u00a0\nthat this is my natural voice sorry again but we\u00a0\ncan do this so the thread that I noticed with the\u00a0\u00a0\nbest selling formations at Sephora they're mostly\u00a0\nlong wearing foundations and I get it you want to\u00a0\u00a0\ninvest in foundations that are long wearing so\u00a0\nthat you only have to apply it once and then you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan forget about it and speaking of investment\u00a0\nthis Foundation costs 5 58 Canadian dollars or\u00a0\u00a0\n30 ml Which is less expensive than the past long\u00a0\nwearing foundations that I have used and when it\u00a0\u00a0\ncomes to claims this Foundation claims to have\u00a0\na magic reflexium to reduce the appearance of\u00a0\u00a0\nwrinkles it also claims to hydrate the skin it has\u00a0\na lightweight formula it's sweat proof humidity\u00a0\u00a0\nproof waterproof and transfer resistant so to\u00a0\ntest all those claims let's go let's go with the\u00a0\u00a0\ntrial so my skin type is oily combination I have\u00a0\noily T-Zone drying some other parts I have very\u00a0\u00a0\ndry skin on the side of my nose because I don't\u00a0\nknow what's going on here in Toronto in Canada\u00a0\u00a0\nbut everybody's getting sick and I don't know if\u00a0\nyou've experienced this since I had covid I had\u00a0\u00a0\ncovid last November end of November after having\u00a0\nvid I feel like my immune system got really weak\u00a0\u00a0\nand so I easily get cough and cold it's tragic\u00a0\nanyways I'm very dry in the side of my nose\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom wiping and getting it irritated and then I\u00a0\nhave hyperpigmentation on the side of my cheeks\u00a0\u00a0\nand also I have big pores so now I am going to\u00a0\nPrime with my favorite favorite primer this is\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Nyx plump right back Plumping syrup primer\u00a0\nso this is a water-based Foundation the first\u00a0\u00a0\ningredient on this Foundation is water so I think\u00a0\nthat this would be compatible with this primer\u00a0\u00a0\nagain I like this primer because you don't have to\u00a0\nwait really long for it to like sit on your skin\u00a0\u00a0\nand it's actually really good if you don't wait a\u00a0\nlot because you want that tackiness of the primer\u00a0\u00a0\nso that the foundation could really stick to your\u00a0\nface and I'm going to use a brush on my right side\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah I think I got the right shape so I got the\u00a0\nshade 5.5 neutral for medium skin with neutral\u00a0\u00a0\nundertones oh well I don't know if you've seen\u00a0\nthat but it really covered my red veins on here my\u00a0\u00a0\nbroken capillary is covered so well it has a scent\u00a0\nthough it has that kind of citrusy Floral sent to\u00a0\u00a0\nit so it is not fragrance free for sure I don't\u00a0\neven think I have to put on some concealer because\u00a0\u00a0\nthe coverage is really good you can still see\u00a0\nsome of my hyperpigmentation peeking through but\nmy veins is covered the redness\u00a0\non the side of my nose is\u00a0\u00a0\ncovered really well this is\u00a0\nthe side with the foundation\nsave it out I would say that when it comes to the\u00a0\nfinish it looks more like a demi matte finish I\u00a0\u00a0\ncan still see a little glow on the top of my\u00a0\ncheeks but very very minimum so it's not a dewy\u00a0\u00a0\nFoundation they also said this Foundation has an\u00a0\nair cool technology so when you put it on your\u00a0\u00a0\nface you feel refreshed you feel that cooling\u00a0\nsensation I don't really feel it I feel the\u00a0\u00a0\nwetness of the foundation when I put it on but I\u00a0\ndon't really feel that freshness or that cooling\u00a0\u00a0\nsensation per se but I would say that it's very\u00a0\nlight on the face and comparing the side without\u00a0\u00a0\nthe foundation also feel like it actually helped\u00a0\nin minimizing the look of my pores it doesn't\u00a0\u00a0\nsay in their claims that this one would give you\u00a0\nlike an airbrush finish based on the name of this\u00a0\u00a0\nFoundation it says airbrush Flawless Foundation\u00a0\nI am an airbrush makeup artist and comparing this\u00a0\u00a0\nFoundation to an airbrushed makeup I think it's\u00a0\nalmost close to an airbrush makeup I'm missing\u00a0\u00a0\njust a tad bit more of the blurring effect when\u00a0\nit comes to my pores makeup would usually give\u00a0\u00a0\nyou that mannequin skin look because it looks\u00a0\nvery smooth and also when I put airbrush makeup\u00a0\u00a0\non my clients sometimes it gets me confused if I'm\u00a0\nover already put an airbrush makeup or not because\u00a0\u00a0\nit looks very very skin like from what I'm seeing\u00a0\nfrom this side it actually really looks skin like\u00a0\u00a0\non this side though we're going to use an airbrush\u00a0\nsponge so let's see if an airbrush punch and\u00a0\u00a0\nan Airbrush Foundation can really give you that\u00a0\nairbrush makeup look so I'm also going to do two\u00a0\u00a0\npumps actually just one and a half because I think\u00a0\nthat's enough when it comes to the consistency\u00a0\u00a0\nthis Foundation really have a liquid consistency\u00a0\nit's really dripping fast on my hand so let's try\u00a0\u00a0\noh yeah this side as usual is giving me more\u00a0\ncoverage because I'm using this airbrush punch\u00a0\u00a0\nthat is full on full-on coverage I still have a\u00a0\nlot if you want to inquire about this airbrush\u00a0\u00a0\npunch I'm still selling them just drop me an email\u00a0\nmy emails in the description bar below I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nget just a little on the tip and work around\u00a0\nmy brows I would say that using the airbrush\u00a0\u00a0\nsponge in the Airbrush Foundation made it look\u00a0\nmore like an airbrushed makeup so I'm going to\u00a0\u00a0\nuse my airbrush punch on the other side as well\u00a0\nsee if it can cover more of my hyperpigmentation\nstill have a lot of foundation left but I don't\u00a0\nneed it anymore I think that I got the coverage\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I wanted maybe just a little bit here so\u00a0\nthis is my face with full face of foundation so\u00a0\u00a0\nfar what I love about this Foundation is that it\u00a0\nreally looks like skin and it's very lightweight\u00a0\u00a0\nand with that amount of foundation it's very light\u00a0\non the face yet it gives you a really really good\u00a0\u00a0\ncoverage it really had the veins on the side of\u00a0\nmy face it really had my hyperpigmentation well I\u00a0\u00a0\ncan still see a little bit of my hyperpigmentation\u00a0\npeeking through but not a lot it just looks like\u00a0\u00a0\nI have really good healthy skin it's 80 there\u00a0\ncomparable to an airbrush makeup because it\u00a0\u00a0\ngives you that natural finish good coverage it\u00a0\nreally hit my pores as well this also claims to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe transfer resistant so I'm going to let this\u00a0\nset for about 10 minutes and we'll test if this\u00a0\u00a0\nis really transfer resistant so 10 minutes has\u00a0\npassed I've already done my eye makeup while\u00a0\u00a0\nletting the foundation set oh I could feel that\u00a0\nit's not because it's very sticky yeah it's on\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah the foundation did transfer so let's touch\u00a0\nit up and I'm gonna make sure that I really powder\u00a0\u00a0\nthis Foundation well because I know that it's\u00a0\ngoing to transfer if not but I don't know if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou notice I feel like it's oxidizing on my face\u00a0\nlike the first few minutes that I've tried it on\u00a0\u00a0\nI feel like it was my perfect shade but looking\u00a0\nat it now I feel like I'm turning more orange I\u00a0\u00a0\nhaven't done any contouring yet or anything so\u00a0\nthis Foundation I'm not too sure but this might\u00a0\u00a0\noxidize the new if you use this foundation\u00a0\nso it's safe to go like one shade lighter\u00a0\u00a0\nnow let's use my cream bronzer let's test if\u00a0\nthis Blends well on top of this Foundation\nhere's the thing with airbrush makeup you have to\u00a0\ndo creams concealers and all those things first\u00a0\u00a0\nbefore putting the airbrush makeup because once\u00a0\nyou put on that airbrush makeup it can only handle\u00a0\u00a0\npowders on top if you put cream the airbrush\u00a0\nmakeup will for sure move so airbrush makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nis a little bit complicated so it's nice that\u00a0\nsome foundations can also perform like airbrush\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup because then it's easier to use for\u00a0\ncommon consumers and also airbrush makeup is\u00a0\u00a0\nnot easy to get I get mine online attempt to\u00a0\nand it's only available in us so you have to\u00a0\u00a0\nwait for shipping so it's nice that at least with\u00a0\nCharlotte Tilbury she's offering a foundation that\u00a0\u00a0\nalmost mimics airbrush makeup and can easily\u00a0\nbe accessible by a lot of people so far when\u00a0\u00a0\nit comes to cream it actually Blended really well\u00a0\non top of this Foundation and it didn't disturb\u00a0\u00a0\nthe foundation and it just Blends smoothly and\u00a0\neffortlessly on top of this Foundation now let's\u00a0\u00a0\nset it with powder I'm going to use my St loader\u00a0\nI love this powder because it's very fine mailed\u00a0\u00a0\nand it has a little glow to it so it doesn't make\u00a0\nyour face look very flat I'm also going to use\u00a0\u00a0\nmy favorite blush as of the moment this is from\u00a0\nthe Sephora collection and this is in the shade\u00a0\u00a0\nflirted up I don't usually use a highlighter when\u00a0\nI'm doing a Foundation review but I really feel\u00a0\u00a0\nvery mad right now that I would need to put on the\u00a0\nhighlighter so I'm going to use my Dior this is\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Dior backstage glow face palette in zero zero\u00a0\none universal and I'm just gonna swirl this three\nthere you go that's more like it I'm also going\u00a0\nto use my Fenty Beauty popsicle and zesty bestie\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is my favorite shade because this one has\u00a0\nan orangey tint to it so this is my finished look\nnow that I've set this foundation with powder\u00a0\nI don't know this is a glowy setting powder\u00a0\u00a0\nand right now my face looks very very\u00a0\nmatte and for a hydrating Foundation I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nnot really seeing that hydrating Factor\u00a0\nso we'll see throughout the day if this\u00a0\u00a0\nlighting up a bit but for now let's see how\u00a0\nthis Foundation looks like on photography\nokay so I'm now in natural light and looking at\u00a0\u00a0\nmy face with this foundation on my face\u00a0\nlooks poreless it's very smooth looking\u00a0\u00a0\nand it's not as matte as what I look like when\u00a0\nI had the studio light so far natural light it\u00a0\u00a0\nlooks really really Flawless now that I've set it\u00a0\nwith powder let's try if this is transfer proof\nyeah it's now transfer proof so this is my fourth\u00a0\nhour wearing the foundation and the coverage is\u00a0\u00a0\nstill full I'm only having a problem with my\u00a0\nnose area where my skin is peeling Foundation\u00a0\u00a0\njust don't want to stick to that area I'm\u00a0\nalso seeing a little shine peeking through\u00a0\u00a0\nmy forehead and on the top of my brows but the\u00a0\nfoundation is not breaking up it's still there\u00a0\u00a0\neight hour update this is how my face\u00a0\nis looking like after the eighth hour\nas you can tell this is very long wearing\u00a0\nI actually think that the airbrush Flawless\u00a0\u00a0\nFoundation from Charlotte Tilbury plus the Estee\u00a0\nLauder powder is such a good match if you want\u00a0\u00a0\nthis Foundation to last long and the side of my\u00a0\nface still looks very very smooth like nothing\u00a0\u00a0\nreally changed on this side of my face where I\u00a0\ndon't have any texture I don't have any big pores\u00a0\u00a0\nwhere it's really smooth didn't even change its\u00a0\ncoverage like it really laid very well on those\u00a0\u00a0\nareas that I don't have any skin problems sorry\u00a0\nI'm losing my voice again but on the parts of my\u00a0\u00a0\nface where I'm very oily like on my T-Zone if\u00a0\nyou can really see some shine on it and on the\u00a0\u00a0\nside just a little on both sides of my nose since\u00a0\nI just had a cold and this part is very irritated\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom always blowing my nose so the skin there is\u00a0\nvery dry very flaky the foundation doesn't want to\u00a0\u00a0\nstick to it and I also have a like a small pimple\u00a0\nover here in the side of my nose the foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nwon't cling to it but a non-problematic areas it\u00a0\nreally looks Flawless so I think that if you're\u00a0\u00a0\nonly concerned is discoloration but you don't have\u00a0\nany texture on your face you're not very oily not\u00a0\u00a0\nvery dry this Foundation would work on you so\u00a0\nwell and this would last you for eight hours no\u00a0\u00a0\nproblem before I give you my final thoughts I also\u00a0\nwant to try if this is water resistant because it\u00a0\u00a0\nis one of the claims of this foundation\u00a0\nso let's try it here here maybe there oh\nI think this would be really water resistant\u00a0\nbecause it actually is already repelling the water\nwe'd say that it is waterproof we do that again\u00a0\non this side it's already repelling the water\u00a0\u00a0\nso for sure this would be waterproof from my\u00a0\nexperience I'm going to rate this donation\u00a0\u00a0\nof 4 out of 5 Stars I actually love using this\u00a0\nFoundation I only have two concerns about this\u00a0\u00a0\nfirst is that it oxidized on my skin not too much\u00a0\nmaybe a shade or a half a shade darker than what\u00a0\u00a0\nit is initially and it didn't continually get dark\u00a0\nas the hours passed by it just got one or half\u00a0\u00a0\nshade darker and that's it I also noticed that on\u00a0\nthe fourth hour like it's not really sticking to\u00a0\u00a0\nthe parts where I have texture and on the parts\u00a0\nwhere I have dry patches to be fair those flaky\u00a0\u00a0\nparts are very flaky like my skin is actually\u00a0\nreally peeling off and I also realized that\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's one of the characteristics of an airbrush\u00a0\nmakeup that's why when my clients go to me and\u00a0\u00a0\nask for an airbrush makeup application I always\u00a0\ntell them to exfoliate regularly leading up to the\u00a0\u00a0\nappointment so that's one thing when using an\u00a0\nairbrush makeup you really have to prep the skin\u00a0\u00a0\nvery well and you have to make sure you don't have\u00a0\npeach fuzz and things like that and since this\u00a0\u00a0\nacts like an airbrush makeup it also mimics the\u00a0\ncons that you would have with having an airbrush\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup application oh now for my Pros I really\u00a0\nlove that it blurred out the pores of my skin\u00a0\u00a0\nI look like I have very good skin especially on\u00a0\nvideos and photos I also like that a little goes\u00a0\u00a0\na long way a small amount of the foundation would\u00a0\nalready give you that full coverage and that's\u00a0\u00a0\nalso a characteristic of an airbrush makeup like\u00a0\na few drops like five drops of an airbrush makeup\u00a0\u00a0\ncan actually cover the whole thing and it really\u00a0\nmade my skin look very smooth especially in the\u00a0\u00a0\nparts where my only concern is this coloration\u00a0\nlike on this part where my only concern is my red\u00a0\u00a0\nveins and my hyperpigmentation this Foundation\u00a0\nreally covered up all those discoloration\u00a0\u00a0\nand I only had a problem with Parts where I have\u00a0\ntexture or where I get very oily and my last Pro\u00a0\u00a0\nis that it can actually really mimic the look\u00a0\nof an airbrush makeup overall I think that this\u00a0\u00a0\nFoundation is designed for special events makeup\u00a0\nwhether it be weddings photo shoots like even for\u00a0\u00a0\nstage makeup because it has that really good\u00a0\nfull coverage when you're on stage they would\u00a0\u00a0\nreally see a Flawless canvas they wouldn't see\u00a0\nany discoloration at all so if you have pageants\u00a0\u00a0\nand things like that I think that this Foundation\u00a0\nwould be good for it but I wouldn't recommend this\u00a0\u00a0\nto people with very dry skin very textured skin\u00a0\nand very flaky skin because it tends to have a\u00a0\u00a0\nmore matte finish for sure it wouldn't stay on to\u00a0\nplaces where you have rough skin or flaky skin so\u00a0\u00a0\nbasically it's a really good foundation to high\u00a0\ndiscoloration but not a really good foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nfor textured skin and if you really want to\u00a0\nget the most out of this Foundation you really\u00a0\u00a0\nhave to make sure that you have a good skin care\u00a0\nregimen making sure that you exfoliate and also\u00a0\u00a0\nmoisturize but do not moisturize with a heavy\u00a0\nmoisturizer it's better to use this foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nwith a lighter moisturizer because then the\u00a0\nfoundation can actually break out so that's\u00a0\u00a0\nmy review on this Charlotte tilbury's airbrush\u00a0\nFlawless Foundation I hope that you find this\u00a0\u00a0\nvideo helpful for my next video I'll be reviewing\u00a0\nthis Sephora best skin ever Foundation this is the\u00a0\u00a0\ncheapest Foundation out of all the foundations\u00a0\nthat I will be reviewing in this series but it's\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of being hype up in social media so I'm\u00a0\nvery very intrigued about this Foundation I\u00a0\u00a0\nwent to Sephora there's a lot of Shades that are\u00a0\nmissing on the Shelf because it's sold out and I\u00a0\u00a0\nhave to buy this shade online so it's quite\u00a0\npopular at Sephora so in my next video I'll\u00a0\u00a0\nbe reviewing this foundation so watch out for that\u00a0\nas usual don't forget to like this video and don't\u00a0\u00a0\nforget to subscribe and hit that notification\u00a0\nBell so you'll always be updated once and new\u00a0\u00a0\nvideos out thank you so so much dolls again for\u00a0\nwatching I'll see you on my next one [Music]\nthank you",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

She has used filters too.  She has yet to apologize and she shouldn&#39;t be given the benefit of the doubt at all. That ship sailed.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

Collection and we all know that when\u00a0\u00a0\nthe princess top is coming out it is time for\u00a0\nprincess makeup I just got this PR box in my\u00a0\u00a0\nmailbox and my husband is not home from work yet\u00a0\nso I decided why don't I sit down and just have\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit of fun and just create a little bit\u00a0\nof a makeup look and just show you some swatches\u00a0\u00a0\nof this collection that just became available\u00a0\ntoday and if you haven't been there before you\u00a0\u00a0\nconsider subscribing before you leave because\u00a0\nI do upload quite a lot of videos every week\nI do receive most things from colourpop in PR and\u00a0\nnot everything gets to be a dedicated video but\u00a0\u00a0\nhonestly I just think this is cute I brought out\u00a0\nthe I brought out the princess top so let's just\u00a0\u00a0\nplay and do a makeup look with this if you haven't\u00a0\nbeen here before I love really bright dramatic\u00a0\u00a0\ncolorful makeup so we're gonna see what kind of\u00a0\na dramatic look we can do with this today let me\u00a0\u00a0\nstart by showing you some swatches of this palette\u00a0\nI honestly think that this is really cute and I\u00a0\u00a0\nreally like that they kept with the cartoon style\u00a0\non the packaging of this palette as the original\u00a0\u00a0\npalette in this collab it's obvious that they pull\u00a0\nthe colors from Snow White herself and then mixed\u00a0\u00a0\nit in with some neutrals I personally like more\u00a0\nwhen they do a color scheme that's based around\u00a0\u00a0\nthe feeling of the movie but I also think that\u00a0\nlike when you look at this you clearly can see\u00a0\u00a0\nthat this is like a snow white palette with the\u00a0\nblue and the red and the yellow and the black so I\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't hate that and I'm very excited to see what\u00a0\nkind of look I can do with this the thing that\u00a0\u00a0\nI am the most interested in I'm pretty sure that\u00a0\nthis is 22 or 24 just a normal price that they do\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen they do like collab palettes the thing that\u00a0\nI'm the most excited about are the Super Shock\u00a0\u00a0\ncheeks there are three different colors and there\u00a0\nis like one deep plum there is one more corally\u00a0\u00a0\nlike almost like a pinky orange and then there is\u00a0\na golden pink and these are all shimmery formula\u00a0\u00a0\nand if you have not been here before hello I\u00a0\nam addicted to the shimmery Super Shock Chic\u00a0\u00a0\nfor muffin colourpop it's one of my favorite if\u00a0\nnot my absolute favorite makeup formula of all\u00a0\u00a0\ntimes I have had makeup on before so I just took\u00a0\nmy face makeup off so maybe there is still some\u00a0\u00a0\nblush left I'm not 100 sure but we are going\u00a0\nto be applying some of this and did you fart\u00a0\u00a0\nI am a big boxer here underneath\u00a0\nthe table and he definitely farted\u00a0\u00a0\nhoney someone is trying to work here but\u00a0\nwe're going to be putting this on and see\u00a0\u00a0\nhow it is I also think that this is going to be\u00a0\none of the most popular items this listen I put\u00a0\u00a0\nthis on I'm like it's gritty is it supposed\u00a0\nto be gritty yeah it's a lip scrub dum dum\u00a0\u00a0\nI thought it was a lip mask but no it is a lip\u00a0\nscrub and this one smells deliciously of Apple\u00a0\u00a0\nand I put it on my lips and I scrubbed a little\u00a0\nbit and then actually the scrub particles just\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of dissolved and it turned into this like lip\u00a0\nbalm so I really did enjoy this one and I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nkeep using it it smells delicious and I really\u00a0\nlike the concept of bringing the poison apple into\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna put it back in the packaging really like\u00a0\nthis it's see-through and you see when you put it\u00a0\u00a0\nin it's like the red I like the idea of putting\u00a0\nthe poison apple into this collection there's also\u00a0\u00a0\na mirror in this collection make a wish and unlock\u00a0\nthe magic so the mirror is here and I think this\u00a0\u00a0\nis super cute I don't know if you're supposed to\u00a0\ntake this yeah you can take the the mirror image\u00a0\u00a0\noff I guess you're supposed to do that I'll just\u00a0\nkeep it on for a bit I usually don't use handheld\u00a0\u00a0\nmirrors but I know a lot of people do and it makes\u00a0\nsense to make a handhelmer for this collection\u00a0\u00a0\nthe last thing that is in this collection is that\u00a0\nthere are two different lip sets and I think that\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is the thing that I personally am the least\u00a0\ninterested in because it is two bright bold lips\u00a0\u00a0\nand I don't usually go for colors like this if I\u00a0\ngo for Reds I go for more orangey Reds or a sheer\u00a0\u00a0\nred and I don't love the Luxe gloss formula from\u00a0\ncolourpop I do love the bullet lipsticks and I\u00a0\u00a0\nreally love the lip liners but the the deluxe lip\u00a0\nglosses are not my absolute favorite but I will\u00a0\u00a0\nsay that this sheer red might give me the effect\u00a0\nthat I'm looking for so I'm sure that we're gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nsee a million videos on this collection because\u00a0\nusually when colourpop does really fun collections\u00a0\u00a0\na lot of people want to do videos and I'm thinking\u00a0\nthat probably everyone is going to do red lip so\u00a0\u00a0\nI thought that I would do a spin on it and just\u00a0\nmake it the way that I want to make it with the\u00a0\u00a0\nlip product that acts really intrigues me the\u00a0\nmost and that is this Luxe gloss in red as a\u00a0\u00a0\nrose it is a red gloss with red and gold sparkles\u00a0\nin it so I'm actually going to be using another\u00a0\u00a0\nlip liner from colourpop and this is cool BFF and\u00a0\nI'm going to use this one and then we're gonna do\u00a0\u00a0\nthe gloss on top and just create the sheer red\u00a0\nlip that I prefer before we do the cheeks and the\u00a0\u00a0\nuh the cheeks and the eyes that is definitely a\u00a0\nfart sir don't make me get you to leave the room\nthis lip mask also like tastes a little\u00a0\nsweet which is delightful this smells just\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it smells like an orange popsicle that\u00a0\nis what the glasses smell like from colourpop\nsee I can be about that I think that that is\u00a0\nreally cute I don't love the super glossy formula\nI like their lip oils and they're like glossy lip\u00a0\u00a0\nsticks more what are they called glowing lips\u00a0\nthat's what they call I like those better\nI don't hate this formula but it's not my\u00a0\nfavorite but if I can get a really good color\u00a0\u00a0\nlike this honestly it's a really good\u00a0\ncolor I could be about that life let me do\nlet me do some cheeks I'm gonna skip this\u00a0\ndark Plum for now and we are gonna do this\u00a0\u00a0\none that is called fair enough which is like a\u00a0\ngolden bright Coral not necessarily an orange\u00a0\u00a0\nthis has way too much pink in it to be an\u00a0\norange in my book so we are just gonna some\u00a0\u00a0\npeople are asking me about this brush this\u00a0\nis for BK Beauty this blush brush that I use\u00a0\u00a0\nso we're gonna do a little bit of this one up\u00a0\nhere oh that is so pretty oh my God I love a\u00a0\u00a0\nshimmery Super Shock uh blush and I'm not using\u00a0\ntoo much of this because it is very pigmented\u00a0\u00a0\nbut look at that oh I love love colors like\u00a0\nthis now let's do the pinky gold on top the\u00a0\u00a0\nI wish I wish I can't remember the last time I saw\u00a0\nthis movie it is I mean it's old it's an old movie\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me see if I can find a good brush for this I\u00a0\nlike brushes like this this is the fo3 by Sigma\u00a0\u00a0\nit is a highlighter brush and I put it on the\u00a0\nbristles here if I wanted to be a little bit more\u00a0\u00a0\nopaque if I want the Shimmer to come through I'll\u00a0\nput it on the bristles on the side not here here\u00a0\u00a0\nand then I'll put it on this is like a\u00a0\nblush highlighter hybrid on me and I'm\u00a0\u00a0\njust putting this on a little bit more\u00a0\nheavy to get the Shimmer to really show\nlove love love this formula and it\u00a0\njust melts into the skin and then\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen I have it on that's when I switch\u00a0\nto this side and I just blend it in\nthe way I love this formula it's\u00a0\nhonestly shocking it's so pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nI love this formula I want colourpop call me I\u00a0\nwant a yellow leaning orange with a peach Sheen\nwhen can we have that I zoomed this\u00a0\nin a little bit so that we can play I\u00a0\u00a0\nI swatched this one because I hadn't swatched\u00a0\nit yet this is like a peachy gold with like a\u00a0\u00a0\npink Sheen to it this could be let's add some\u00a0\nof that that could be a highlighter let's see if\u00a0\u00a0\nwe can add some of that because that is a super\u00a0\nshark let's see if we can add some of that here\u00a0\u00a0\noh yeah that definitely works on my skin tone I\u00a0\nwill link everything that I'm using down below\u00a0\u00a0\nand I don't know if I mentioned either I do have\u00a0\na code with colourpop my code isn't Jessica and\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can get some money off when you're making\u00a0\nan order sometimes it doesn't work on bundles\u00a0\u00a0\nand sometimes it doesn't work on um mostly it's\u00a0\nbundles but sometimes it might not be working on\u00a0\u00a0\nthings and I know some people told me that they\u00a0\ntry to add bundles or the full collection of the\u00a0\u00a0\nSnow White and my code didn't work so it might be\u00a0\nthat you're trying to add a bundle and sometimes\u00a0\u00a0\nthey just don't work on bundles but yeah this\u00a0\none definitely works as a highlighter as well\u00a0\u00a0\num really really pretty it's always nice\u00a0\nwhen you can use like some shades can be\u00a0\u00a0\na highlighter too I don't know if you can see\u00a0\nthe pink coming through a little bit now I can\u00a0\u00a0\nsee it but I know I don't know if you can\u00a0\nsee it what do we want to do should we do\nI want to do oh my God are you like annoyed let's\u00a0\ndo red yellow blue black brown in the crease and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen we'll do the white and then the corner just\u00a0\nbecause I want to play I think we're going to\u00a0\u00a0\nstart with this one the peach one this is what\u00a0\nwe're doing hold on to your panties I mean this\u00a0\u00a0\nisn't necessarily like a tutorial this is just me\u00a0\ntrying out the shades and seeing if they're like\u00a0\u00a0\nif they're any good if they are the good colourpop\u00a0\nquality or if they are the great colourpop quality\u00a0\u00a0\nor if they are the mediocre colourpop quality\u00a0\nthey they're not always amazing uh I'm just\u00a0\u00a0\nputting on a sheer layer of this Peach I'm not\u00a0\ntrying to build it up but this one works pretty\u00a0\u00a0\ngood just so that we can have like a Peach\u00a0\ntransition color before we go into something\u00a0\u00a0\na little deeper I think I'm gonna use I'm using\u00a0\nthis one now and I think I'm gonna use this like\u00a0\u00a0\na little darker brown and I'm going to use a\u00a0\ndenser brush and I'm gonna try and build that\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit in the crease and we'll see how\u00a0\nhow intense we can be so this is the darker\u00a0\u00a0\nbrown I don't know if they necessarily meant\u00a0\nfor this collection to be like a super dramatic\u00a0\u00a0\nit's I don't know if it's meant for super\u00a0\ndramatic but listen they sent it to me\u00a0\u00a0\nthey must have known what I was gonna do\u00a0\nwith it it is unavoidable and that okay sir\u00a0\u00a0\nsir I love you but this smell this smell is not\u00a0\nhelping with my work environment okay I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nhave to call HR if this is how it's gonna be that\u00a0\nbrown is very pigmented and it's like taking over\u00a0\u00a0\nI need to be a little bit more careful oh\u00a0\nthat brown is actually very impressive I am\u00a0\u00a0\nthoroughly enjoying this like clay Brown moment\u00a0\nI think we're gonna go in with the blue let me\u00a0\u00a0\nfind a good brush I think we're gonna go in with\u00a0\nthe blue on the lower lash line let's just start\u00a0\u00a0\nthere just to see how it's gonna look I think\u00a0\nI'm gonna spray my brush and I'll put this on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe lower lash line and then I'm gonna do the\u00a0\nblack because I just want to see like where\u00a0\u00a0\nare we going oh my God I have a hair and hair\u00a0\nin my eye where are we going like depth wise\nI think we have left princess territory\u00a0\nI'm definitely the villain in this story\u00a0\u00a0\nso there is a black in here but it is a\u00a0\nblack with some Shimmer in it but listen\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm still gonna use it so we're gonna use\u00a0\na little bit of this and we are gonna put\u00a0\u00a0\nthat in the outer corner and I don't really\u00a0\ncare about the Shimmer in this look per se\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I am going to be adding some Shimmer to\u00a0\nthe lid and we are going deeper and deeper into\u00a0\u00a0\ninter villain territory I feel like this whole\u00a0\nvideo is like my origin story started out\u00a0\u00a0\nwith the princess top and now we're here so\u00a0\nI think I'm gonna start with the red and then\u00a0\u00a0\ndo the yellow and I think I'm gonna do the red\u00a0\njust with my finger because I am not too thorough\u00a0\u00a0\nwith where that one ends up and I just want to Pat\u00a0\nsome on oh that is really nice and now that I have\u00a0\u00a0\nshorter Nails I can do that and this Shadow is a\u00a0\nlittle bit more of a set than anyways like I can\u00a0\u00a0\nsee in the pan that it's more of a satin Shadow\u00a0\nthan it is like a like full on foil metallic and\u00a0\u00a0\nalso like using your finger for metallics is\u00a0\nprobably the best way to get full-on opacity\u00a0\u00a0\nwithout having to spray anything and when I spray\u00a0\nI just use whatever setting spray I have at hand\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one is almost out it's from LH Cosmetics\u00a0\nbut I just use whatever setting spray I have\u00a0\u00a0\nbut that works out really good like put\u00a0\nthe yellow in the inner part and then let's\u00a0\u00a0\ndo the white but I think I'm gonna spray\u00a0\nthose but let me let me clean this first\u00a0\u00a0\nalso let me use a bright blue in my waterline\u00a0\nso that we can really get the effect\u00a0\u00a0\nfully of the blue lower lash line this yellowy\u00a0\ngold is called true love I am going to spray\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one because I want to make sure that this one\u00a0\nis as shiny as possible and I want to be a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit more detailed with this one and I don't think\u00a0\nmy fingers are really going to cut it for in here\nsomething like that I'm gonna blend these\u00a0\ninto each other a little bit better better\u00a0\u00a0\npromise Pinky Promise well promise to try\u00a0\nI'm just adding a little bit more red on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe edge to make sure that they are blending\u00a0\ninto each other and then let's clean this brush\u00a0\u00a0\nto the best of my ability and let's take some of\u00a0\nthe spell breaker it's this one the white one and\u00a0\u00a0\nlet's see if I spray this because this seems\u00a0\nlike a traditional Shimmer if we put that here\nnot exactly what I would like want for my\u00a0\ninner corner I prefer a mat for my inner corner\nbut I mean it will do\nI think that this is the look I actually kind\u00a0\nof like it this part needs a little blending\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat do you have to say for yourself\u00a0\nwhat do you have to say for yourself sir\nto make four to ten this is the look everything\u00a0\nis done and I really like how everything came\u00a0\u00a0\ntogether my favorites are still the Super Shock\u00a0\ncheeks those are definitely my favorite products\u00a0\u00a0\nin this entire collection and those are\u00a0\nabsolutely beautiful if you wanted to\u00a0\u00a0\ntry the palette I definitely think it's the\u00a0\ngood colourpop quality the shimmers are not\u00a0\u00a0\nyes I see the shimmers are not super super glidy\u00a0\nand like foiled but I still think they're really\u00a0\u00a0\ngood Shimmer formula and as you can see I didn't\u00a0\nhave any problems creating a really dramatic look\u00a0\u00a0\nif that is what you're after I really did like\u00a0\nthis gloss as well and it feels like balmy did\u00a0\u00a0\nthey reformulate this or did I just change my\u00a0\ntaste in these glasses because I remember do\u00a0\u00a0\nyou want to go because I remember I tried one of\u00a0\nthe Winnie the Pooh glosses as well and I was like\u00a0\u00a0\nokay because I remember I tried one of the\u00a0\nWinnie the Pooh classes as well and I was like\u00a0\u00a0\nI didn't remember it being this balmy did\u00a0\nmy preferences just change maybe I should\u00a0\u00a0\ngive these another try because sometimes your\u00a0\npreferences change over time what you prefer\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat you like or maybe it's something about the\u00a0\nwear time because like honestly I've only had them\u00a0\u00a0\non for an hour so what do I know I also really\u00a0\ndo enjoy um the lip scrub I think it smells and\u00a0\u00a0\ntastes wonderful the packaging is just stunning I\u00a0\nalso have that lip scrub from the Winnie the Pooh\u00a0\u00a0\ncollection and if you missed that one maybe this\u00a0\none could be a good like thing to get instead and\u00a0\u00a0\nof course if you like the mirror it's a nice\u00a0\nmirror but I don't use handheld mirrors like\u00a0\u00a0\nthat so for me that's gonna be probably something\u00a0\nthat I give away to someone else but I did enjoy\u00a0\u00a0\nthe collection I had a lot of fun playing with it\u00a0\nper usual I do like the products that colourpop\u00a0\u00a0\ncomes up with I don't think it's just good for\u00a0\nthe price I also think overall they make good\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts not everything is my favorite but a lot\u00a0\nof the products from colourpop are things that\u00a0\u00a0\nI use outside of YouTube as well I hope you're\u00a0\nhaving an absolutely amazing day don't forget to\u00a0\u00a0\nsubscribe before you leave and I will see you\u00a0\nagain tomorrow in my new makeup releases bye\n[Music]

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I fell for it too many times. <br><br>I\u2019ve heard a few Youtubers talk about products that they want to try but they wouldn\u2019t purchase and immediately turn around and ask the brand to send them it as PR. I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on. It just makes me look at them differently.**",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links.

I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on.

        "transcript_text": "Hello beautiful and welcome back to my channel\u00a0\nand welcome to this video we are going to talk\u00a0\u00a0\nabout the new Natasha denona love love face\u00a0\npalette that's what it's called we are gonna\u00a0\u00a0\ndo some swatches I am gonna do look we're gonna\u00a0\ndemo this one and see if we like it or not I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nfairly sure that this is the Valentine's\u00a0\nrelease foreign this year she usually does\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething Valentine's inspired I'll show you this\u00a0\none next to some other things that she has that is\u00a0\u00a0\nlike Love Inspired too and you can see whether or\u00a0\nnot you think that this is too similar or not but\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm just excited to be digging into this one this\u00a0\nis the first video that I'm filming after vacate\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm excited to be back in the studio for me\u00a0\nagain if you haven't been in before do consider\u00a0\u00a0\nsubscribing I do upload quite a lot of videos\u00a0\nand right now we're gonna dive into this one\nI feel a little bit Rusty I haven't filmed\u00a0\nfor a week and I feel a little rusty this\u00a0\u00a0\none is like a metallic pink on the uh outside\u00a0\nthis one looks like the other face palettes\u00a0\u00a0\nthat she released which is like a face and\u00a0\neye palette it is a highlighter mine came\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit smooshly smooshed and there is\u00a0\na blush and then there are five eyeshadows I\u00a0\u00a0\ngot some questions for people asking why there\u00a0\nare never any bronzers in there but bronzers\u00a0\u00a0\nare so specific so if you put a bronzer in\u00a0\nhere you're excluding so many skin tones\u00a0\u00a0\nby just putting a bronzer in here and a blush\u00a0\nand a highlighter usually can be stretched over\u00a0\u00a0\nmore skin tones and be used in different ways\u00a0\nand combined in different ways so they can work\u00a0\u00a0\non a multitude of skin tones and I think that\u00a0\nis way Smarter with that being said I do hope\u00a0\u00a0\nthat Natasha denona comes out with bronzers in\u00a0\nthe future so this one is five eyeshadows one of\u00a0\u00a0\nthem is a shimmer there is a blush and there is a\u00a0\nhighlighter this highlighter formula I did smoosh\u00a0\u00a0\nit back in together it seems to be the same great\u00a0\nhighlighter formula that was in her other face\u00a0\u00a0\npalette I don't know if this blush is the same\u00a0\nbut if it is the same from the other face formula\u00a0\u00a0\nit isn't my favorite formula from her it looks a\u00a0\nlittle bit hard pressed it's a little bit like you\u00a0\u00a0\nneed to build it up on your cheeks you can make\u00a0\nit work but not my absolute favorite but eyeshadow\u00a0\u00a0\nare my some of my absolute favorite eyeshadows\u00a0\nespecially the matte ones and to be getting four\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit more on the colorful side because\u00a0\nthere is a pretty bright pink it is a pastel pink\u00a0\u00a0\nand then there's this dark dark prom plummy one\u00a0\nand then there is this more like mauvy one I think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's really small to include here if you don't\u00a0\nwant to go bright and this like rose gold shimmery\u00a0\u00a0\none I'm excited about this one I know that not\u00a0\neveryone is excited about this one because I\u00a0\u00a0\nknow that some people might think that this is\u00a0\nboring or we've seen it before I will say let me\u00a0\u00a0\nactually pull up some footage of this one next to\u00a0\nsome other things that she's done before in this\u00a0\u00a0\nlove family she has the mini love palette the mini\u00a0\nCrush palette and the Big Love palette as well and\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't think that these are necessarily dupes\u00a0\nbut I definitely think that they're similar enough\u00a0\u00a0\nwhere I'm starting to think that maybe next year\u00a0\nwe can have another theme because we definitely\u00a0\u00a0\ndo not need a fifth love palette I'm sick I'm\u00a0\nI'm just putting it unless she does something\u00a0\u00a0\nspectacularly different we don't need another\u00a0\npink palette don't turn into Pat McGrath please\u00a0\u00a0\nand thank you but I am excited to be diving into\u00a0\nthis one it's taking everything in me to not do\u00a0\u00a0\nan all-mat look and for that reason we might do\u00a0\nan all matte look because these three together\nthey're going to be amazing together and\u00a0\nthere's going to be so many people that\u00a0\u00a0\ndo a look with this one and do the shimmery one oh\u00a0\u00a0\nfirst of all I got this that look fantastic\u00a0\nlook at the fingerprints already I got this\u00a0\u00a0\nit looked fantastic and it was over 70 dollars\u00a0\nit looked Fantastic's prices is normally not the\u00a0\u00a0\nit's not the bar you should hold up all other\u00a0\nbrands to the last face palette that Natasha\u00a0\u00a0\ndenona had was 62 on Sephora us for some reason\u00a0\nsome places have higher prices and then they will\u00a0\u00a0\nadd discount it's it's annoying this was like 70\u00a0\nsomething they had a discount code so I can get it\u00a0\u00a0\ndone I really really wish that looked fantastic\u00a0\nbut just get in line with everyone else it's so\u00a0\u00a0\nannoying that they're doing their own pricing\u00a0\nwith all million different discount codes and\u00a0\u00a0\nit's honestly it's frustrating and I wish they\u00a0\nwould stop I do believe that this one is going\u00a0\u00a0\nto be available at other places as well and I do\u00a0\nthink it looked fantastic accidentally released\u00a0\u00a0\nit too early but listen that is not my fault that\u00a0\nis their fault I'm gonna buy it if they release it\u00a0\u00a0\nthey sent it to me I'm gonna do a little bit of\u00a0\ndetective work and see if I can find where this\u00a0\u00a0\nis going to be available later if I can promise\u00a0\nyou that it's gonna be at least on uh Sephora I've\u00a0\u00a0\nalso heard rumors in the corridors that Natasha\u00a0\nknown as coming to Ulta when this palette is\u00a0\u00a0\navailable I will link it in the description box\u00a0\nit's going to be the first link in the description\u00a0\u00a0\nbox so if you're interested in this palette and\u00a0\nyou do shop through my links thank you so much\u00a0\u00a0\nfor supporting my channel I do use Affiliated\u00a0\nlinks okay let's zoom in and let's get going\u00a0\u00a0\nenough with the cheated chatter so I do want to\u00a0\nstart with the blush and highlight because I'm not\u00a0\u00a0\nwearing that on my skin right now so I'm thinking\u00a0\nwe'll just go in with this blush it's called Cream\u00a0\u00a0\nBlush but yeah it picks up really good um this\u00a0\nis a Sonia G brush this is the classic base\u00a0\u00a0\nI am not the person that does a lot of foundation\u00a0\nwith a brush sometimes I like it sometimes I don't\nhow do I feel about this color\num ambivalent\nthat is\nit's like a pastel cream paint\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't like it oh I don't like it\u00a0\noh I don't like it oh I don't like it\nI don't like it at all I don't like\u00a0\nthis color who thought of this color\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm not mad I just have questions\nI don't like it let me see if we can go over that\u00a0\nwith a sponge maybe I can tone it down a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit not living dying sneezing for this cheek color\u00a0\nit's pastely white faced pink not normally my\u00a0\u00a0\njourney so instead we're doing this with this is\u00a0\na reference 35 we're going to do the highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\nI do love this highlighter formula\u00a0\nthough I think it is stunning\noh yeah oh yeah I really wish that she would\u00a0\ncome out with these highlighters in singles\u00a0\u00a0\nand also I really really hope that we get to\u00a0\nsee bronzer singles from Natasha in the future\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I really like the way that she\u00a0\ndoes powder products or even cream the\u00a0\u00a0\npowder products so with the highlighter\u00a0\non top I do like my cheeks but they're\u00a0\u00a0\nI've I feel like I'm a caricature of like it\u00a0\nlike a little carob or you say carob or cherub\u00a0\u00a0\nin Sweden you would say kerub but I'm not\u00a0\n100 sure how you would say it in English\num\nI don't know about this cheek color I'm just\u00a0\ntrying to go over with everything I have on my\u00a0\u00a0\nand if you're wondering about anything that's\u00a0\non my face I will link it down below okay let\u00a0\u00a0\nme do some eye primer and we can start with\u00a0\nthis one here I think the Esme one I'm only\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to be using Esme Juliet and Aiko because\u00a0\nI love nuts I'm just gonna stamp this Esme on\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm not gonna be swiping because I want this\u00a0\nto be as intense as possible and sometimes\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen you start swipely swiping especially if\u00a0\nyou have looser Lids like I do like mine are\u00a0\u00a0\na little wrinkled they're a little loose they\u00a0\nlost a little bit of their firmness I feel like\u00a0\u00a0\nstamping the Shadows on make them look a little\u00a0\nbit more pigmented a little bit more even it's\u00a0\u00a0\nnever going to be 100 even because I definitely\u00a0\nhave some nooks and crannies in my Lids now that\u00a0\u00a0\nI did not have before so like Shadows just make\u00a0\neverything look uneven but I can do my best and\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen I want stuff to be really pigmented I try to\u00a0\nstamp it on and then I start blending the edges\u00a0\u00a0\nthat is a really fun it's a bright pink but it's\u00a0\nnot like Barbie it's like this like handle on\u00a0\u00a0\nthis like this is from I think this is a Cleona\u00a0\nbrush it's part of the dragon fruit collection\u00a0\u00a0\nit's like a brighter but still warmer like\u00a0\nalmost I don't want to say raspberry but\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's something not like white based maybe\u00a0\nthat's what I wish maybe that's what I should\u00a0\u00a0\nsay so I'm gonna do this here just in the\u00a0\ncrease I'm not going to put it on my lid\nthat is pretty I really like that I don't think\u00a0\nI'm gonna use the pastel like I can use the pastel\u00a0\u00a0\nit's called Juliet to blend the edges if I feel\u00a0\nlike it's needed but I don't think it's needed\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause my primer is a little yellow base so I\u00a0\nthink it's better if I blend this warm pink into\u00a0\u00a0\nit then if I blend the white based pastel into it\u00a0\nI'll just put the same under the eyes I really I\u00a0\u00a0\nused to be all about that doing a contrasting\u00a0\nlower lash line but I think that the longer\u00a0\u00a0\nI've done makeup the more I have come to realize\u00a0\nthat I prefer both on me and on others actually a\u00a0\u00a0\nmatching or at least adhesive lower lash line\u00a0\nunless I'm doing something neutral and having\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething pop beyond their lower lash line because\u00a0\nI still think that that is actually quite pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I used to do like you know a blue eye and\u00a0\na red lower lash line I don't like that anymore\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's not my journey I think it's fun to have\u00a0\nlike an evolving taste of what you like and what\u00a0\u00a0\nyou don't like because who knows maybe in the\u00a0\nfuture I'll like it again should never be above\u00a0\u00a0\nchange let me just put it like that okay so I\u00a0\nwant to use this Aiko shade and I have a brush\u00a0\u00a0\nhere this is from the beaky Beauty and Angie hot\u00a0\nand flashy this is number a504 and this one that\u00a0\u00a0\nI used here is the BK Beauty 209 and I'm gonna use\u00a0\nthis smaller one with the Aiko one and I I don't\u00a0\u00a0\ntalk a lot about brushes but I will try and do\u00a0\nthat more in the future but try to mention what I\u00a0\u00a0\ncan oh that is nice that is nice all of these are\u00a0\npowder by the way they're not cream to powder that\u00a0\u00a0\nthese are her original powder Shadows except\u00a0\nthe metallic well it's a metallic powder but\u00a0\u00a0\nit's not a mat of course I know Captain\u00a0\nObvious has entered the building\nthat's pretty Blends him pretty good with the pink\u00a0\nI'm gonna use that in the crease and on half the\u00a0\u00a0\nlid and then we're gonna see how good this pastel\u00a0\npink is because let me tell you when Natasha\u00a0\u00a0\ndenona gets a pastel right she gets a pastel right\u00a0\nlet me do a little drama on the lower lash line\u00a0\u00a0\ntoo I'm just adding that dark shadow I will say\u00a0\nI think that this is a really good Dark Shadow\u00a0\u00a0\nbut it is a little powdery which makes it not the\u00a0\nabsolute easiest to build up not a bad eyeshadow\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I do prefer and I know this isn't for everyone\u00a0\nthis is me this is this is a me thing I sometimes\u00a0\u00a0\nprefer when dark or really bright colors have\u00a0\nalmost a little bit of a not grit to them but\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a little there's something to them that just\u00a0\nmakes them stick and just build and I know some\u00a0\u00a0\npeople would prefer the immediate blendability but\u00a0\nI would rather have something super pigmented that\u00a0\u00a0\nI can build up until like almost Blackness then\u00a0\nsomething that is made to be super easy to blend\u00a0\u00a0\nwith and I know not everyone is the same so I\u00a0\nguess some of us are just gonna have to like agree\u00a0\u00a0\nto disagree but as you can see it's definitely a\u00a0\ngood eyeshadow and I was able to get it dark and\u00a0\u00a0\nI was able to somewhat blend it into the pink is\u00a0\nit perfect no but we're not trying to be perfect\u00a0\u00a0\nwe're trying to be good enough no one's out here\u00a0\ndoing like the airbrushed Instagram pictures\u00a0\u00a0\nI'll be honest with you not even the Instagram\u00a0\nPeeps are we're just trying to do something that\u00a0\u00a0\nwe can be happy with so I think what I'm\u00a0\ngonna do hmm I need a flat brush okay so\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is a flat brush it is a little dirty but\u00a0\nwe'll be fine these are actually from Bella\u00a0\u00a0\nbeach bar so I'm gonna pick up that Juliet\u00a0\nshade and we are just gonna stamp this on\u00a0\u00a0\non the inner half of the lid and we are going\u00a0\nto see I mean it's obvious that it has pigment\u00a0\u00a0\nand it goes on which is good that is one of two\u00a0\nit needs to have pigment when it goes on but it\u00a0\u00a0\nalso needs you also need to be able to like blend\u00a0\nout the edges a little bit without loosing it like\u00a0\u00a0\nit needs to actually stick to the lid as well and\u00a0\nnot just be on top of the lid and as soon as you\u00a0\u00a0\njust like breathe too violently it just flicks\u00a0\noff the lid but so far so good and I will say I\u00a0\u00a0\ndo think that Natasha denona makes really good\u00a0\nmatte pastels she has found a way to make them\u00a0\u00a0\nsubstantial but still keep the pastelness because\u00a0\nsometimes pastels end up being very sheer like\u00a0\u00a0\nvery sheer I think that that looks really good I'm\u00a0\na fan should I do a liner I never do liner no no\u00a0\u00a0\nnew no liner but let me do a little mascara and\u00a0\nI'll show you what it looks like before I put any\u00a0\u00a0\nfalsies on so this is where we're at right now and\u00a0\nI really like it it's like a warm pink burgundy\u00a0\u00a0\nlook and I really like it of course I didn't use\u00a0\nall of the eyeshadows I didn't use the Shimmer\u00a0\u00a0\nnobody's shocked and I didn't use this like\u00a0\nmore mauvy one and of course if you use this\u00a0\u00a0\none together with this one it's going to be a\u00a0\nmore muted look it's not going to be as bright\u00a0\u00a0\npink and I think it's smart to put something\u00a0\nin a palette that makes it go a little bit in\u00a0\u00a0\na different direction if that is what you need\u00a0\nI love an all matte look so I'm gonna keep it\u00a0\u00a0\nlike this but let me put on some falses and we can\u00a0\nhave a final chat about this palette and whether\u00a0\u00a0\nor not it makes sense to buy it okay so mission\u00a0\naccomplished everything is on my face on my eyes I\u00a0\u00a0\nI really like the look I'm a little\u00a0\nokay I love Natasha denona and I love\u00a0\u00a0\nthe quality of her last face palette and I\u00a0\nlike these colors more but I hate this blush\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't like it on me I think it looks chalky even\u00a0\nnow when I've tried to fix it I still think it\u00a0\u00a0\nlooks chalky I don't like the color at all I wish\u00a0\nshe would have picked a warmer non-white-based\u00a0\u00a0\npink in this one because I think this pink is\u00a0\nhonestly kind of unflattering probably on a lot of\u00a0\u00a0\nskin tones and I don't even care that much about\u00a0\nI'm flattering like I'm more about having fun with\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup but even I could see that that blush was\u00a0\na no-go for me and I know they're gonna be people\u00a0\u00a0\nin the comments saying they love a blush on me I'm\u00a0\nsorry I don't I I don't so this blush that's a no\u00a0\u00a0\nand then when I look at these Shades and like when\u00a0\nI like compare them with like other like in a way\u00a0\u00a0\nI already own these shades uh if you have the the\u00a0\nbig love palette the one that's like this this one\u00a0\u00a0\nI if you have these small palettes because this\u00a0\none has the dark Plum this one has the pastel\u00a0\u00a0\npink you also get the rose gold in some of these\u00a0\nif you have all of the other love palettes and\u00a0\u00a0\nyou don't think you're gonna love this blush I\u00a0\nreally don't think that this is for you I really\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't think this is for you if you don't own\u00a0\nany of the love palettes and you really love\u00a0\u00a0\nthe idea of a face and eye palette together\u00a0\nbecause I do the packaging is beautiful the\u00a0\u00a0\nformulas I like the formulas of these I think\u00a0\nthis is a different formula than the one we had\u00a0\u00a0\nbefore it was easier to pick up than the one\u00a0\nfrom before the eyeshadows are beautiful if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou think you're gonna use all these products\u00a0\nI don't think it's anything wrong with it but\u00a0\u00a0\nreally really go back and look at the footage with\u00a0\nthis pink blush and be like am I gonna use that\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause otherwise you might as well just\u00a0\npick up one of the mini eyeshadow palettes\u00a0\u00a0\nI will say my favorite is this pastel pink like\u00a0\nmatte it's beautiful I like it but I'm not in love\u00a0\u00a0\npun intended I hope you're having an absolutely\u00a0\namazing day thank you so much for being here if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou want to have some more insights in how\u00a0\nmy vacation was I'm gonna have a vlog on my\u00a0\u00a0\nVlog channel it's gonna come up hopefully later\u00a0\nthis week and I will see you actually again on\u00a0\u00a0\nthis channel uh tomorrow because I'm gonna have a\u00a0\nvideo again with some other makeup products so bye\nforeign [Music] [Applause]\n[Music]",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

        "transcript_text": "hey guys so for today's video I'm gonna be\ndoing a palette Bingo video Rebecca Morgan\nposted a palette Bingo video the other week\nand I really liked the way she did it because\nshe actually used two palettes so if you don't\nknow what palette Bingo is pretty much you\nwill take an eyeshadow palette and you will\nuse a random number generator app to pick\nthe shades that you're going to use so instead\nof grabbing a palette and doing like your\ntypical go-to look you're kind of forced to\nplay with different colors and do something\nkind of different and I don't mean to brag\nbut I feel like I'm pretty good at coming\nup with color combos and using a whole palette\nso I wanted to test myself and do it with\ntwo palettes so the two palettes I'm gonna\nuse today are the Natasha denona retro Glam\nand the Natasha denona retro palette these\nare two very different color stories but I\nfeel like mixed together I could create a\npretty cool look so I think my plan is to\nstart with two shades from each palette and\nmaybe add more if needed but I'm gonna use\na random number generator app to pick my eyeshadows\nI'm excited so I'm using the pretty random\napp and I have it set from 0 to 15 because\nthere's 15 Shades in the palette and let's\npick my first number number 14 which would\nbe this guy right here because I'm going like\none two three four five ten fifteen so we\nhave the shade Belle I'm going to Swatch that\nso I don't like forget all right starting\noff with the pinky Shade that's fun I'm also\ngoing to alternate palettes too so let's go\nto the Retro palette and I'm going to show\nyou that I'm not cheating so I had 14 there\nfive which would be the shade Vivian you can't\neven see it splashed in my hand but there\nis Belle and that is Vivian kind of like a\ngood blending shade all right back to Retro\nglam six so that is the shade Maxi oh that's\nfun a little like pink and gray moment so\nfar this is a beautiful color palette I love\nit and back to Retro number eight which would\nbe five six seven eight psychedelic this is\na good color combo right here oh that's pretty\nI kind of wish I got like one of the mint\ngreen Shades should I do one more shade because\nso far this is like an easy look for me I'm\ngonna try to add one more shade from retro\nGlam this is honestly really fun to pick the\nShadows this way okay what we got give me\nsomething good can you why are you not working\nall right give me something good here three\none two three is the shade Oscar another easy\nshade you know what I'm just gonna work with\nit though this is what the app wanted me to\ndo today so I'm gonna use all five of these\nshades for an eyeshadow look today I honestly\nfeel really good about this color palette\nso let's get started so I'm gonna start by\npriming with the rare Beauty eyeshadow primer\nforeign\nthat out with my Sigma f64\n[Music]\nif you guys watch my videos you know I don't\nlike to set my primer when I use Natasha's\nShadows they just work better when your primer\nis tacky in my opinion so I'm going to take\na sigma E28 in the shade of the zine I think\nI said Vivian before but I just Googled how\nto say it it's vavine so I'm just going to\npress that shade into my crease and I'm very\nvery fair today so this actually will show\nup as kind of like a light baby pink on me\nI actually might just kind of set my whole\nlid with this shade might as well so I'm kind\nof packing it into my crease and on my lid\nthis shade is so light so when the shade was\nselected I was like this is barely even gonna\nshow about my eyes so that's why I added a\nfifth shade my eyes look a little dry right\nhere in my inner Corner hopefully that kind\nof goes away as I do my eye shadow honestly\nmy Skin's just kind of been a mess the past\ncouple days it's extra dry right now I had\nlike a picking episode so it's just like my\nperiod starting next week it's just all over\nthe place right now going back into Retro\nGlam I'm gonna pick up Belle and I'm gonna\npack this shade in the crease I love using\nthis E28 brush when I'm using her Shadows\nbecause it's a really good packing brush you\ncan also kind of blend with it too well I\nlove this shade it kind of matches my shirt\ntoday I like this kind of mauvy vibe [Music]\nand see how I'm just kind of like pressing\nover the edges of this Shadow and that's how\nit kind of Blends out by itself kind of crazy\nlike I'm not really doing a blending motion\nit's more of just a packing motion and it's\nblending it out\n[Music]\nI am dipping back into this shade a few times\nto build it up now I'm going to take a little\nmore of the vein on this brush and kind of\nget around the edges of that Bell shade just\nto soften it out even more\n[Music]\nall \nright let me check my list here we did Belle\nwe did the vine we got Oscar maxion psychedelic\nI'm gonna take Oscar on my finger and that's\ngonna go mostly on my inner lid kind of like\nmy entire eyelid because I'm going to add\nthat Maxi shade as well actually I'm gonna\ngo on my entire eyelid so Oscar is going all\nover here then I'm just going to take a sigma\ne25 and blend around the Oscar shade [Music]\n[Music] and again just blending around the\nShimmer\nforeign\nso originally I was going to make this kind\nof easy and just put Maxi on the outer half\nof my lid like I like to do but I'm kind of\nwondering if I do like a little Shadow wing\nwith it and kind of switch it up because I'm\nhonestly not the best at Shadow wings so maybe\nI'll do that but before I do that I'm gonna\ngo into that psychedelic shade again on my\nfinger and that's going to go in the inner\npart of my lid oh the shade is so pretty pairs\nreally well with Oscar love that and I kind\nof like to bring it into my inner crease right\nhere for a little extra pop\n[Music]\nand then going back to my blending brush softly\nblending nothing crazy here so I'm going to\ntake a sigma e65 in the shade Maxi and I'm\ngoing to start by putting that along my entire\ntop lash line\n[Music]\nall right now attempting a shadow Wing oh\nthis is so hard to do\n[Music]\n[Music]\nokay that's not bad [Music]\nokay I think for the first time like ever\nin my life my right wing looks better than\nmy left one so funny I do kind of want to\ndeepen up the like base of my lash line and\nthe base of the wing so I'm going to take\na black gel liner and I'm just going to dot\nthat along my lash line trying to stay really\nreally close to my lashes and then smudge\nthat out\nand I'm also going to pull this black outwards\na little bit kind of like I'm drawing the\nbottom of the wing but I'm really trying to\nhave a light hand because I don't want it\nto be like oh my gosh you have a black Wing\nbecause it's not taking a little more eyeliner\nright here [Music]\n[Music] then I'm going to add a little bit\nmore maxi on the wing here kind of like that\nso there's what it looks like with the black\nadded and without just kind of gives it a\nlittle more like definition okay so again\njust drawing a tiny bit on the outer part\nof my top lash line smudging it out [Music]\nI've been doing a little bit right here and\nthe eyeliner I'm using is by house labs and\nthis one is so dang pigmented that you only\nneed a tiny bit of eyeliner\nall right I feel like my eyelids are looking\nreally shimmery but there's kind of my shadow\nWing it's not amazing again I'm not the best\nat this technique but I'm gonna go do the\nrest of my face makeup off camera and then\nwe'll finish up the eyes together all right\nmy face makeup is done let's finish up the\neyes so at this point I have used all five\nshades on my eyelids so I'm gonna use the\nsame shades on my lower lash line I'm going\nto start with maxi on a sigma E30 now I'm\ngoing to run that across my entire lower lash\nline [Music] I love this shade kind of smoked\nout like this really pretty then I'm going\nto take a little bit of Oscar and I'm actually\ngoing to add that to the lower lash line so\nthis is a lot of Shimmer like the only matte\nshade I have oh I guess that the vine shade\nwas matte too so the vine and Bell were my\nmatte ones the Oscar actually works pretty\nwell to soften out this Maxi shade I like\nthat so again starting with maxi [Music]\nthank you and then Oscar\n[Music] psychedelic on a sigma e33 and I'm\ngonna pop that in my inner corner kind of\nbeen liking using a fluffy brush like this\nfor my inner corner highlight just to diffuse\nit out even more I'm also going to add my\nrare Beauty highlighter in Enlighten just\nto make this even brighter\nall right I'm happy with how this looks I'm\ngonna go pop on some mascara and lashes and\nthen I'll show you the full face all right\nI popped on my mascara and lashes and for\nmy lashes I'm wearing the bright lashes half\nlash and flutter I actually did cut this half\nlash a little bit shorter than it is when\nyou receive it so it's just right out here\non the outer Corner super cute I love the\nslash I did also add just a tiny bit more\nof the black eyeliner just on the outer part\nof my lower lash line just because I wanted\nto deepen it up a little bit all right and\nhere's what the full face looks like I had\nsuch a hard time picking a lip color again\nI think I need some like light baby pink colors\nin my collection because all of my lipsticks\nlean a little more Peach and I need something\nmore pinky to go with this look because a\npeach just did not pair with these kind of\npinky eyes today so don't ask me what's on\nmy lips it's like a mix of like four different\nthings honestly but anyways I love how this\nlook turned out today I'm actually filming\nthis on Valentine's Day so this kind of is\nlike a perfect Valentine's Day look but now\nthat I'm looking at this look I feel like\nI can get a really similar look with just\nusing the Retro palette since my random number\ngenerator didn't pick any of like the minty\nShades from this one but honestly I had so\nmuch fun filming this video it was really\nnice for me not to pick the color combos and\nhave an app pick it for me so let me know\nif you like this type of video and also let\nme know any like palette combinations you\nwant me to do this video with again I would\nlove to hear your feedback and I think we\ncould make some pretty cool looks so I hope\nyou guys enjoyed this video thank you so much\nfor watching and don't forget to like And\nsubscribe",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

WHy?\nI always like to layer my eyeliner.\nI use chocolate brown eyeliner first\nand then a jet-black liner.\nIt suits my skin tone a lot.\nUsually, my eyeliner is thin and long.\nElongated, Cat-like, and sultry even for a daytime look.\nBut, I know the Clean girl look prefers doe-like eyeliner\ninstead of cat eyeliner.\nSo I am making sure that the end of my eyeliner isn't long and thin.\nI still drew a small wing because it suits my eye shape.\nGuys, I have a weird obsession with eyelashes.\nI made an entire video on my lashes\nand mascara routine and post-care.\nJust the 360 of my lash obsession.\nI make sure that the lashes are separated and curled properly.\nI am using a new lash curler from Shiseido.\nI have heard very things about this curler.\nIt's like a cult-fav lash curler in East Asia I believe.\nThis and another brand called Shu Umera.\n(I invest my money in useless makeup items)\nNext to that, I applied a good coat of\nwater-proof mascara from Loreal.\nWith a good hydrating setting spray,\nI am setting the cream products in place\nbefore applying a few strokes of my favorite setting powder.\nWhen I use sponges like this to set my makeup with powder,\nI always make sure to dab the powder\non the back of my hand and then apply it on my face.\nThis ensures that I get an even coat of powder on my face.\nThis is a quintessential step for me.\nI have noticed that if I miss this step,\nmy base is gonna be left with\nan uneven and patchy layer of powder.\nYou won't lose any product when you pat it on the back of your hands.\nYou are just making sure that the powder\nis evenly settled on the sponge.\nSo when you dab it across your face,\nit sticks to the cream products evenly.\nThen, I applied mascara to my bottom lashes.\nMake sure they are separated\nand look clean.\nI applied heat to my lashes so the curls get to stay longer.\nRemember when I applied the HA serum and Vaseline?\nMy lips ended up absorbing all the hydration\nwhile leaving them soft and supple.\nI am taking the same tinted lip balm\nand I applied a thin layer to my lips.\nThis burnt burgundy is not a color that proves\nMY LIPS BUT BETTER.\nThis is THE COLOR that proves\nMY LIPS ARE BETTER.\nBye b1tch\ud83d\ude2d\nVerdict: I ended up liking the tinted lip balm.\nAnd obviously I 100% recommend the contour stick from Kay Beauty.\nThe hair - IDK, I felt and looked very MATURE.\nAnd I am a KID at heart so IDK.\nI felt so mature.\nI felt 25 but I am 23 in real-life.\nAnyways, I don't know if\nPatchi Ammal Paati is proud of me for this makeup lewk.\nBut I am proud of her\nbecause she SLAYYYEDD the Clean Girl Makeup\nback in the 1900s.\nThat is it, my queens.\nSee you when I see you next.\nBYE>",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on.

after\u00a0\nbut one product i got in there is the drunk\u00a0\u00a0\nelephant glycolic body lotion and i saw wayne goss\u00a0\nhe recommended this and he said to use this as a\u00a0\u00a0\nface moisturizer because for the money you pay you\u00a0\nget a full body lotion which is very good to use\u00a0\u00a0\non your face as well and you get 240 milliliter\u00a0\nand drunk elephant is an amazing amazing skincare\u00a0\u00a0\nbrand i love their colors i love their whole\u00a0\nmarketing thing about their products it's just\u00a0\u00a0\nwonderful so i'm gonna start with this and\u00a0\nmoisturize my face i'm gonna focus a lot\u00a0\u00a0\non the skin today very simple no makeup makeup\u00a0\nlook this is the first time i'm using this product\u00a0\u00a0\nhas absolutely no smell and the skin feels\u00a0\nvery very moisturizing it absorbs the product\u00a0\u00a0\nperfectly into the skin without leaving it\u00a0\noily so here's the first step in my no makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup routine i love how the face feels now\u00a0\nlet's move on to some glowy dewy drops and this\u00a0\u00a0\nis by glow recipe these are the niacinamide dew\u00a0\ndrops and i like to add this for extra shine just\u00a0\u00a0\nfor more moisturizing of the skin and on top i'm\u00a0\ngoing to go with a sunscreen and that's by super\u00a0\u00a0\ngoop this is my favorite this is the glow screen\u00a0\nspf 40. this is a beautiful beautiful sunscreen\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm using this little by little because i don't\u00a0\nwant to run out and this has a little bit of tint\nit has the spf 40 which protects you from the\u00a0\nsun my next product is not from sephora and it's\u00a0\u00a0\nnot from the drugstore let's have a sip of coffee\u00a0\nfirst if you're wondering what's on my lips right\u00a0\u00a0\nnow i'm just wearing it for hydration this is the\u00a0\ndior it's like a lip balm and this is in the shade\u00a0\u00a0\nzero zero six berry i got this a long time ago\u00a0\nfrom my mom you can see there's it's pretty used\u00a0\u00a0\nand i like to add this to my lips to just add a\u00a0\nlittle bit of pop of color let's move on to cover\u00a0\u00a0\nthis face with more stuff now my next product is\u00a0\nfrom style vanna which is a korean makeup brand\u00a0\u00a0\nand this is the bb cream b beautiful natural bb\u00a0\ncream and this again has spf 30 made in korea and\u00a0\u00a0\ni don't think i don't know if there's a shade but\u00a0\nit's such a beautiful i'll show you it has a tint\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can see and this gives your face a beautiful\u00a0\nperfect amount of coverage for a no makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup look so let's apply it with a brush\u00a0\ni'm gonna use the rare beauty foundation brush\nthis is what i like to use\u00a0\non a daily basis when i don't\u00a0\u00a0\nwear a lot of makeup this provides enough\u00a0\ncoverage and it makes your face look very healthy\u00a0\u00a0\nvery glowing it's just a beautiful beautiful\u00a0\nproduct now when i want to add a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nmore coverage you can add a foundation of\u00a0\nyour choice on top of this if you prefer\u00a0\u00a0\nmore coverage like i said today is a no makeup\u00a0\nmakeup look so we wanna have almost a skin like\u00a0\u00a0\ntype of looking face so we don't wanna show\u00a0\nwe wanna still show the imperfections we don't\u00a0\u00a0\nwanna show that we have the face covered in any\u00a0\nmakeup but that doesn't mean we're not gonna add\u00a0\u00a0\nbronzer and blush because this is a no makeup\u00a0\nmakeup look i am not going to add concealer we\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to leave the under eye area as is but i do\u00a0\nwant to add a little bit of my mac paint part on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe eyelids i'm gonna zoom you guys in so you can\u00a0\nsee up close how this bb cream looks on the face\nyou guys see how beautiful glowy healthy looking\u00a0\nand you still see any imperfections or any moles\u00a0\u00a0\non the face so this is a beautiful bb cream\u00a0\nfor a no makeup look now let's move on to brows\u00a0\u00a0\nnow these are my natural brows and a\u00a0\ngreat product for a no makeup makeup look\u00a0\u00a0\nis merit merit is a very minimalistic makeup\u00a0\nbrand you find that sephora is more on the\u00a0\u00a0\nhigher end is like a luxury brand and\u00a0\nthis is their brow product beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful packaging it is very this is very\u00a0\ninteresting when you open it check this out\u00a0\u00a0\ni bet you thought that this is where the wand\u00a0\nis but it's actually on this side so the product\u00a0\u00a0\nis in here this is the wand now this is for your\u00a0\nbrows and because it's very minimalistic you this\u00a0\u00a0\ndoesn't provide much coverage right so you want\u00a0\nto use this on those days where you don't want\u00a0\u00a0\nyour eyebrows to look very fluffy you just\u00a0\nwant a little bit of tint of color this is\u00a0\u00a0\nin the shade brown and this is a voluminizing\u00a0\npomade now if you have really really thin\u00a0\u00a0\nbrows i don't know if this product is for you\u00a0\nbecause this is more of a product that kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nfills in bushier brows and it just gives it this\u00a0\nnice finished look you know like something is\u00a0\u00a0\nthere but you can't really tell that it's there so\u00a0\nthis is when i use this product on those no makeup\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup days let's add a little bit of color to\u00a0\nthe face and i think the perfect bronzer for a\u00a0\u00a0\nno makeup makeup look is the cosas bronzer this is\u00a0\nsuch a pretty pretty bronzer this is in the shade\u00a0\u00a0\nmedium golden bronze because it's a very sheer\u00a0\nvery natural looking sun-kissed bronzer that's\u00a0\u00a0\nwhy i've chosen this one my favorite brush is\u00a0\nthis moda brush and just add a tiny bit of color\nso i chose this bronzer because it is\u00a0\nthe most less intense bronzer you have\u00a0\u00a0\nto build it up and it has a little bit\u00a0\nof sheen in it that helps with making\u00a0\u00a0\nyour face look like it's your actual skin where\u00a0\nthe sun hits you since we have the bronzer here\u00a0\u00a0\nlet's do the eyes i'm gonna use the same bronzer\u00a0\ni'm not gonna use eyeshadow i'm gonna use this\u00a0\u00a0\nguy right here with a fluffy brush and put it\u00a0\nin the crease and kind of all over the eyelid\u00a0\u00a0\njust to give the eye a little bit of color and\u00a0\nblend it in with whatever we have on the face\nso there's absolutely no eye shadow involved\u00a0\nin today's video now if you want to take this\u00a0\u00a0\nno makeup makeup look to another level feel\u00a0\nfree to add a pop of shimmer on the eyelid\u00a0\u00a0\nor you can also add um a colorful eyeliner in\u00a0\nthe waterline like i have a bunch here that you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan choose from so you can choose any color and\u00a0\nyou just take this eye look to another level but\u00a0\u00a0\ntoday we're gonna keep it as natural as possible\u00a0\nso you can see how beautiful this bronzer applied\u00a0\u00a0\non the eyelids and ties everything together\u00a0\nwith the face so i'm not going to apply anything\u00a0\u00a0\nunderneath the eyelids let's move on to blush\u00a0\nfor blush i chose this cheek and lip multi stick\u00a0\u00a0\nand this is by cold beauty and this is in the\u00a0\nshade sienna look at this this is a beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful blush and you can use this on your\u00a0\ncheeks and on your lips we might add this to\u00a0\u00a0\nthe lips too to just keep it very natural\u00a0\nand i'm going to apply this with a brush\u00a0\u00a0\nagain by cold beauty both products got this from\u00a0\nshoppers drug mart and just add a little bit of\u00a0\u00a0\npop of color on the cheek not much\u00a0\nlike i normally add but just a tiny bit\nmake it look like i just came from outside from\u00a0\ncold air which i actually did right before i\u00a0\u00a0\nwalked my puppy very very natural looking look\u00a0\nat that that's all you need now i don't wanna\u00a0\u00a0\nadd highlighter however i do have a very no makeup\u00a0\nmakeup look highlighter and that's the tower\u00a0\u00a0\n28 superdue no shade highlighter this\u00a0\nis very balmy kind of reminds me of\u00a0\u00a0\nvaseline you can see absolutely no shade\u00a0\njust vaseline so i'm going to use my finger\u00a0\u00a0\nand add this to the high points of my cheek\u00a0\njust to add that extra health and glow\nand hydration to your cheeks\u00a0\nbecause it's very balmy\nlook at that\nso there's no shimmer nothing it's just like\u00a0\na balm and i like to use this on those type of\u00a0\u00a0\ndays the no makeup makeup days because you don't\u00a0\nwant to add highlighter because your skin doesn't\u00a0\u00a0\nreally have highlighter right you want to look\u00a0\nlike you're not wearing any makeup now for my\u00a0\u00a0\nbottom lash line even when i don't wear makeup\u00a0\nor just foundation i like to add a pop of color\u00a0\u00a0\nusually brown in my waterline and close to my\u00a0\nlash line because i feel like my eyes look quite\u00a0\u00a0\nempty without anything so that's what i like\u00a0\nto do so i got this milani stapled eyeliner\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is in the shade moss boss and this is\u00a0\nkind of like an olive green grayish eyeliner\u00a0\u00a0\nso i'm going to add this on the line\u00a0\nand i'm gonna add it on the bottom here\nand with the other end it has a smudger smudger\u00a0\nbrush i'm just gonna smudge it here a bit\nwe don't want to create any wing line nothing\u00a0\njust add a little bit of dimension to the eye\u00a0\u00a0\ni love this milani eyeliner it has a beautiful\u00a0\nshade that goes really good with hazel eyes brown\u00a0\u00a0\neyes dark darker eyes i just love the shade\u00a0\nthe moss green and now what do we have left\u00a0\u00a0\nwe're gonna apply mascara for mascara i'm using\u00a0\nthe essence lash princess mascara nothing new\u00a0\u00a0\ni'm gonna go ahead and apply this all over my\u00a0\nlashes top and for my bottom i'm gonna use the\u00a0\u00a0\nmerit mascara because this is very minimalistic\u00a0\nit's not lengthening so we don't want to have too\u00a0\u00a0\nmuch volume and length on the\u00a0\nbottom once so i'm going to apply\u00a0\u00a0\nthis on my lashes and i'll be right\u00a0\nback so enjoy this information\nso here is the final complexion look with the eyes\u00a0\nnow let's move on to the lips so i'm going to use\u00a0\u00a0\nvery simple keep it simple the same one the cold\u00a0\nbeauty cheek and lip product and i'm going to use\u00a0\u00a0\na lip brush this is the moda precision lip\u00a0\nbrush and just add a little bit of color to

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

She has used filters too.  She has yet to apologize and she shouldn&#39;t be given the benefit of the doubt at all. That ship sailed.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

concealer onto my\u00a0\u00a0\neyelids and blend that out and I've been\u00a0\nusing this concealer just recently and I\u00a0\u00a0\nreally love it so y'all gonna be seeing\u00a0\nso much more of my videos using it but I\u00a0\u00a0\nstill love my tarte concealer so I'm gonna be\u00a0\ngoing back and forth between the two of them\nyeah now I'm going to go ahead and set that\u00a0\nconcealer using my Sacha Buttercup setting\u00a0\u00a0\npowder and I'm just dabbing it on right\u00a0\non top of the concealer nothing special\nfor my eyeshadow today I'm going to be\u00a0\nusing this palette by Juvia's place and\u00a0\u00a0\nI believe this one is called The Warrior\u00a0\nbut I'll link it down below for you guys\nand I'm just gonna go ahead and blend\u00a0\nit out right here as you can see I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ntaking it all the way over to my nose this\u00a0\nwill be my transitioning color for today\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm going back into the palette and I\u00a0\nwill be using this darker shade right\u00a0\u00a0\nhere I'm gonna apply it on the outer\u00a0\ncorner of my eye and blend it inwards\nnow we're gonna use this golden Shimmer shade\u00a0\nright here from the same palette and I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nuse my fingertip to apply this right on the\u00a0\ntop of my eyelid I'm also going to use this\u00a0\u00a0\nother palette by Julia's place this one is\u00a0\ncalled festival and I'm going in with this\u00a0\u00a0\nwhite one right here and I'm gonna apply it\u00a0\non the inner corner of my eyes and blend it in\nso I started off using a fluffy brush to blend\u00a0\nthe shade in then I got a flatter brush to make\u00a0\u00a0\nit more precise and kind of like doing a little\u00a0\ncut crease but not really you know what I'm saying\nnow I'm gonna lie my eye with this eyeliner from\u00a0\nMaybelline this is actually one of my favorite\u00a0\u00a0\neyeliner to use I use it all the time as for\u00a0\nLashes these are from AliExpress I believe and\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna be doubling them I'll show you guys how\u00a0\nI take two of them and I put them onto each other\u00a0\u00a0\nlike this and because of the little stickiness\u00a0\nthat came on them they just stick to each other\u00a0\u00a0\njust like that and this is what it looks like\u00a0\nafter I put them together and that's what I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna be doing for each one of my lashes today so\u00a0\nglue them on I'm gonna be using my very favorite\u00a0\u00a0\nKiss strip lash Aisa so I thought about it and\u00a0\nthese lashes are actually not from AliExpress\u00a0\u00a0\nthey are from timu that new

setting\u00a0\nspray on it just to moisten it a little bit\n[Music]\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen I'm applying my Foundation I like\u00a0\nto just push the makeup into my skin as\u00a0\u00a0\nopposed to rub it in because I feel like\u00a0\nthe makeup go on so much better it looks\u00a0\u00a0\nFlawless when you rub it in you rub in\u00a0\nyou know dead skin all of that so your\u00a0\u00a0\nfoundation doesn't

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links.

I fell for it too many times. <br><br>I\u2019ve heard a few Youtubers talk about products that they want to try but they wouldn\u2019t purchase and immediately turn around and ask the brand to send them it as PR. I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on. It just makes me look at them differently.**",

today I'm gonna go ahead and showcase you\u00a0\u00a0\nguys danessa myricks now originally this was not\u00a0\ngoing to be my next video in my full face kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nSeries this month but I must say out of all the\u00a0\nnew things that I have I just with lusting and\u00a0\u00a0\ndusting and just yearning to try her new Cream\u00a0\nBlush formula so I just I had to go ahead and\u00a0\u00a0\njust film this video and I must say it has brought\u00a0\nmy spirits up just filming this video and playing\u00a0\u00a0\naround here so yeah if you're interested in\u00a0\nseeing how I created this face with these\u00a0\u00a0\nmakeup items I did of course reach out of this\u00a0\ncollection because there's some things from the\u00a0\u00a0\nbrand that I don't have because I just quite\u00a0\nliterally don't need but that said if you're\u00a0\u00a0\ninterested in hearing my opinions about the makeup\u00a0\nitems that I do have and how this brand overall\u00a0\u00a0\nworks with my aesthetic in just Aesthetics\u00a0\nin general then let's just get to it [Music]\nhey guys so for today's video I'm very very\u00a0\nexcited to do another full face of makeup\u00a0\u00a0\num today's Beauty brand that I'm going to be doing\u00a0\na full face of is actually Vanessa myricks I've\u00a0\u00a0\ndone one in the past um but I kind of wanted\u00a0\nto just reinvent that look I'll be using very\u00a0\u00a0\nsimilar products I really didn't buy anything\u00a0\nspectacularly new except for two products that\u00a0\u00a0\nI will be testing out for the first time one\u00a0\nI've already had similar products just this\u00a0\u00a0\nis a different shade so I got another one of her\u00a0\ncolor fixes in the shade chocolate it is the matte\u00a0\u00a0\nformulation which I know and love so I will be\u00a0\njust using this at some point throughout my look\u00a0\u00a0\nand then I also did get one of her flushed bombs\u00a0\nwhich is her um blush formulation so I'm very\u00a0\u00a0\nvery excited we're already zoomed in we're already\u00a0\nready to go so let's just get into it all right so\u00a0\u00a0\nfirst thing we're going to do is go ahead and use\u00a0\nher blurring bomb I have it in the shade Universal\u00a0\u00a0\num I think this is a really good formula\u00a0\nspecifically for primer I know other people\u00a0\u00a0\nuse this as an actual foundation and they truly\u00a0\nenjoy it I clearly have only had this shade\u00a0\u00a0\nso I've never been able to kind of try it in\u00a0\nthat formulation but I really do enjoy it I\u00a0\u00a0\nfind that it really does go on to the skin nicely\u00a0\nand really preps your skin I do have combination\u00a0\u00a0\nskin in case you um did not know I'm pretty\u00a0\nnormal on the perimeter face but oily in the\u00a0\u00a0\ncenter so that's why I only really focused that\u00a0\nparticular product in the center because that's\u00a0\u00a0\nreally my only trouble area for longevity um\u00a0\nfull disclosure though I'm actually filming\u00a0\u00a0\nthis at night so I don't really care if this lasts\u00a0\nvery long because I'll only be wearing it for like\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe four to five hours tops for the foundation\u00a0\nthat I have like I said I don't have the universal\u00a0\u00a0\nor I don't have the blurring balm in a color skin\u00a0\nshade although I could definitely see me maybe in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe future getting one I do although have her\u00a0\nyummy skin Foundation I actually had to get\u00a0\u00a0\ntwo different shades because neither shade worked\u00a0\nperfectly for me so I have 21 in and I want to say\nI don't remember what the other shade is it's\u00a0\nnot on here let me see if maybe this is the one\u00a0\u00a0\nno um I don't know what the other shade is I'll\u00a0\nmake sure to figure it out and put it down below\u00a0\u00a0\nfor you all but basically what I ended up doing\u00a0\nwas literally mixing the two shades and it kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof just works so I believe this is the one that\u00a0\nliterally has the two shades mixed inside so\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm just gonna use this uh people have kind\u00a0\nof toted this as being her first Foundation\u00a0\u00a0\num which foundation with that that was like\u00a0\nthe full full coverage one and it didn't have\u00a0\u00a0\num any like um cutting agent in it but she did\u00a0\nrelease her glow oil which I actually do have\u00a0\u00a0\nthat as well but with this Foundation you just\u00a0\nquite literally don't need it because it's pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nmuch the combination of her first foundation\u00a0\nwith an oil so you already have it kind of\u00a0\u00a0\npre-mixed as you can see this concoction is just\u00a0\nnot dark enough for me so I do need to go ahead\u00a0\u00a0\nand open up the dark foundation and get some\u00a0\nthis is very much full coverage though so if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou are not a fan of full coverage I would not\u00a0\nrecommend it and it does have a smell this smell\u00a0\u00a0\nto me it's like more of just the oil kind of smell\u00a0\nit's not truly oil it's like a beauty oil but\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's what I get coming off of this it's\u00a0\nlike an oiled down smell um yeah I really\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't have any other explanation for it but\u00a0\nyeah we're just going to work this all over\u00a0\u00a0\nmy face okay so this is definitely not a perfect\u00a0\nmatch but that kind of comes with the territory\u00a0\u00a0\nof mixing two Foundation Shades together\u00a0\nso there's that but I'll be working with\u00a0\u00a0\nall of the other products to make it work and for\u00a0\nsome reason this top is not clothing is this I\u00a0\u00a0\nhad the wrong top okay um so yeah I do like\u00a0\nthis product but do know it is full on High\u00a0\u00a0\nHigh coverage and from what I could tell I was\u00a0\nnot the only person who had difficulty finding\u00a0\u00a0\ntheir perfect shade so if you're somebody who\u00a0\nis not okay with kind of buying two different\u00a0\u00a0\nshades or whatever have you maybe don't stick\u00a0\nwith this another thing if you are somebody\u00a0\u00a0\nwho has combination oil oily I wouldn't say that\u00a0\nthis is the best foundation that she has released\u00a0\u00a0\nin her range I would actually tell you to look\u00a0\nat the first release which I just I the cover\u00a0\u00a0\nthe total cover no I think that's a different\u00a0\nbrand I genuinely can't think of that name of that\u00a0\u00a0\nrange but I would say look at that range or look\u00a0\nat the color tones in this range because both of\u00a0\u00a0\nthose ranges really tote to being full coverage\u00a0\nor High coverage with a very good longevity\u00a0\u00a0\nthis I think is a little bit better for those who\u00a0\nhave a little bit more normal to dry skin don't\u00a0\u00a0\nget me wrong as an oily skin girl I still make\u00a0\nit work but just know that know that so there are\u00a0\u00a0\nquite a few things that I can use for concealer\u00a0\num I don't think I'm actually going to I think I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nactually just going to maybe just use a normal\u00a0\nconcealer because I want this look to actually\u00a0\u00a0\nlook nice but she does have these color fix Shades\u00a0\nthat are in the neutral range or in the nude range\u00a0\u00a0\nand you can use these to quite literally create\u00a0\na full face of makeup I've seen people do it\u00a0\u00a0\num I probably could use this nude shade but\u00a0\nI just I don't need that much coverage I just\u00a0\u00a0\nwant a little bit lightening so I'm just\u00a0\ngonna reach for an easy to grab concealer\u00a0\u00a0\nreally quickly I'm also going to go ahead and\u00a0\nset my Foundation then I will come back and\u00a0\u00a0\nwe're going to do bronzer blush highlighter\u00a0\nand my eyes so just give me one second okay\u00a0\u00a0\nso I went just went ahead and did my concealer my\u00a0\npowder and my brows because I just don't have any\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts that I want to use from danessa\u00a0\nmyricks that said once again I have seen\u00a0\u00a0\npeople use color fixes in the Brows I just don't\u00a0\nhave the products like I don't have the spoolies\u00a0\u00a0\nDisposable to use these types of products so I'm\u00a0\njust not going to do it at least not for today\u00a0\u00a0\nbut next I did want to go ahead and do my bronzer\u00a0\nyou guys know I have already panned danessa\u00a0\u00a0\nmyrick's actual bronzer this is her balm contour\u00a0\nand I still use this interchangeably as a bronzer\u00a0\u00a0\njust because this particular shade is warmer than\u00a0\nmy skin tone so I didn't actually set my whole\u00a0\u00a0\nface I set my T-Zone area so I'm just going to go\u00a0\nahead and apply this I do like to apply my base\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts all with the same application method\u00a0\nso because I went ahead and did my foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nwith a sponge I do like to just go ahead and do my\u00a0\nbronzer and subsequently my blush with a sponge as\u00a0\u00a0\nwell as you can see it is quite subtle it's not\u00a0\ngoing to be as pigmented and as opaque as her\u00a0\u00a0\num her cream and bronzer but as the name suggests\u00a0\nit is a bomb type product right so you're not\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to expect something that is going to be\u00a0\nsuper opaque super pigmented really showing up\u00a0\u00a0\nI it still does bring some life to the base that I\u00a0\nappreciate and so that's why I like to use it and\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I said it is darker than my skin tone I just\u00a0\ndidn't really pack it on but in the event that\u00a0\u00a0\nyou are interested this is the Shaded deep one\u00a0\nand I do actually have a bronzer hunt with this\u00a0\u00a0\nso I will go ahead and have it linked\u00a0\ndown below for you all in the event that\u00a0\u00a0\nyou want to see it to its true true mode\u00a0\nI just kind of want to do a very subtle\u00a0\u00a0\nbe you know I'm not really feeling a very\u00a0\nimpactful beat as you can see I'm low energy today\u00a0\u00a0\nso yeah anyways the next thing I want to do is go\u00a0\nahead and try out this Cream Blush I personally\u00a0\u00a0\nlike to put my Cream Blush down before I do cream\u00a0\nhighlighter and after I do cream bronzer it's just\u00a0\u00a0\nmy steps but I know some people like to do it\u00a0\ndifferently be great so I did only pick up one\u00a0\u00a0\nshade I've been trying to be good lately and\u00a0\neven though I'm interested in so many things I\u00a0\u00a0\npick up one and in the event that I have to have\u00a0\nsome other Shades I'll get them later so this\u00a0\u00a0\nis in Golden hour this is the darker of the two\u00a0\noranges and this is a spectacular shade tone I'm\u00a0\u00a0\njust gonna go ahead and Swatch it for you all it\u00a0\nhas the exact same feel as the bomb primer that I\u00a0\u00a0\nuse because it is the exact same formula the only\u00a0\ndifference is that this now has as a blush tone\u00a0\u00a0\ninstead of like a skin tone as the other tomes\u00a0\ndid in that range so with this I do want to use\u00a0\u00a0\nmy sponge the fly in the ointment is I just have a\u00a0\nlot on my sponge so I found a slightly clean area\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm just going to pick up the cream\u00a0\nblush on that area and we're just going to\u00a0\u00a0\noh my goodness we are just going to\u00a0\napply it and to me this looks beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nit went on very easily I don't feel as though\u00a0\nI'm getting a lot of like uh gelatinous kind of\u00a0\u00a0\ntone or unnecessary shine I feel like it very\u00a0\nmuch is true to pan it's showing up I'm oh\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm definitely loving this it's definitely\u00a0\ntaking over the look but I'm not mad at it\u00a0\u00a0\nby any means I want to see if this dries down\u00a0\nvery similar to what people have said the bomb\u00a0\u00a0\num formulation does in the skin tone Shades I\u00a0\nwant to see if that is true um and I didn't say\u00a0\u00a0\nhow much products is this since it's a new product\u00a0\nI really want to give you guys some details why is\u00a0\u00a0\neverything written so small so there's six grams\u00a0\nof product in here or 0.21 ounces it does have the\u00a0\u00a0\nabsolite technology which makes it true to this\u00a0\nrange and why they kind of put it in this range\u00a0\u00a0\nand then let's see there's a 12 month shelf\u00a0\nlife it is made in China designed in the US\u00a0\u00a0\num and yeah I think that's all the information\u00a0\nthat you could possibly need from this and from\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat I know I'm very very excited to see how\u00a0\nthis works but just application alone I'm very\u00a0\u00a0\nvery happy with it typical quickly it takes\u00a0\nme some time to get these types of products\u00a0\u00a0\nto build up and especially building them up with\u00a0\na sponge because that sponge gives it like that\u00a0\u00a0\nweddish um feel I feel like most times I have to\u00a0\nreally fight with the sponge to get the color and\u00a0\u00a0\nnot necessarily too much do so I'm very very happy\u00a0\nabout that now it is time for the highlighter now\u00a0\u00a0\nthe highlighter that I have from her range is in\u00a0\nthis formulation it is in the Compact and this is\u00a0\u00a0\nin the shade hot water what I have found with\u00a0\nthis particular product is that it works best\u00a0\u00a0\nif you put a powder highlighter down and then you\u00a0\nkind of use this to melt that powder highlighter\u00a0\u00a0\ninto your skin to make it look like it is a part\u00a0\nof your skin so let me demonstrate I just need to\u00a0\u00a0\nfind a highlighter I wasn't that prepared I knew\u00a0\nwhat I wanted to do today but I wasn't prepared\u00a0\u00a0\nenough to pull the highlighter out so one of my\u00a0\nfavorite highlighters lately has been this one\u00a0\u00a0\nsize Fantasia highlighter I think this is still\u00a0\navailable last time I checked it's actually a part\u00a0\u00a0\nof the President's Day sale at Sephora but I think\u00a0\nthis will be going up maybe a day after now this\u00a0\u00a0\nwill be going up on President's Day so if you're\u00a0\ninterested definitely definitely I would recommend\u00a0\u00a0\nthis product but that is just me so I'm just using\u00a0\na dirty Sonia G brush that I really need to clean\u00a0\u00a0\nI just haven't found me in it to do it but I'm\u00a0\njust going to apply this highlighter as I would\u00a0\u00a0\nnormally apply my powder highlighters which is on\u00a0\nthe high points of my face and the areas that I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ncomfortable being highlighted I know some people\u00a0\nhighlight you know their forehead and their chin\u00a0\u00a0\njust those aren't places that I find I want to\u00a0\nreally highlight mainly because of where my oils\u00a0\u00a0\num project I don't want them to be projecting\u00a0\nthe oil wait I don't want the highlighter to\u00a0\u00a0\nproject my oil I hope that makes sense so I just\u00a0\napplied it and as you can see it looks beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nand it truly is one of those formulas that I\u00a0\ndon't think you need to use this technique but\u00a0\u00a0\nit was the closest one I could find so\u00a0\nnow what I'm going to do is take the\u00a0\u00a0\num the cream highlighter and what I like to\u00a0\ndo is literally just pop it right on top and\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe I should have used a highlighter that was\u00a0\na little thicker and didn't melt into my skin as\u00a0\u00a0\nwell but it just in my opinion melts that product\u00a0\nin and makes it look a little bit more skin like\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is the cheek with the cream highlighter\u00a0\nand the powder highlighter and this is it without\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know if you guys can see a difference\u00a0\nit might like I said just be like application\u00a0\u00a0\nerror I should have used a highlighter that just\u00a0\ndoesn't melt as well into my skin but this is how\u00a0\u00a0\nI was using this product when I was at the height\u00a0\nof using it like almost every application I was\u00a0\u00a0\ntruly just using it in this manner I haven't tried\u00a0\nin a very long time actually applying a powder\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlighter on top let's do it let's see what\u00a0\nhappens so I'm just going to take that Sonia G\u00a0\u00a0\nfan brush again and just go right on top let's see\u00a0\nif I can get it I don't want to disturb anything\u00a0\u00a0\ndoes it even highlighter I think it's\u00a0\nhighlighter I think it's even more emphasized\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah it is than it was before so if you're\u00a0\nsomebody that like you can't even get wrap\u00a0\u00a0\nyour head around the possibility of using this\u00a0\nto kind of top a powder highlighter you can\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely use it oh my goodness to be a base\u00a0\nI've just traditionally used it as a Topper but\u00a0\u00a0\nthat looks great it looks really really good\u00a0\nlet me just melt everything in just a tad\u00a0\u00a0\nokay okay so we are getting there let me just do\u00a0\nmy lips very quickly for lip liner today I'm just\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna go into this baby this is the Nyx suede\u00a0\nmatte lip liner in Mason it is just a typical\u00a0\u00a0\nBrown nothing crazy unique or anything like that\u00a0\nI think I already had a lip balm on my lips so\u00a0\u00a0\num yeah that might be why the shade isn't showing\u00a0\nup as of oh as opaque but I'm perfectly fine with\u00a0\u00a0\nthe amount of lipping lipping I'm perfectly\u00a0\nfine with the amount of lip liner that is\u00a0\u00a0\nappearing here now for my lip shade I think\u00a0\nI'm gonna try to concoct something with these\u00a0\u00a0\ntwo this one is in the shade nude seven it's\u00a0\na little bit more yellow based and this one\u00a0\u00a0\nis nude tin it's a little more neutral base\u00a0\nI like both Shades but I would love to kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof mix the two and her color fixes you can\u00a0\nuse literally anywhere around the body do\u00a0\u00a0\nknow that do know that less is absolutely\u00a0\nmore with her formula especially this one\nI had a DOT on my finger a DOT\nokay so that's that and then I\u00a0\nthink I'm gonna take the nude tin\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'm just gonna use it to kind of\u00a0\nalign and blend nude seven a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit more into my skin tone because\u00a0\nI like the tone it just is a little\nit's a little out there so\u00a0\nlet's see what we can do\nI'm just going to get a little bit more I\u00a0\nlove the color and I love the combination\u00a0\u00a0\nI just feel like the top and the bottom of\u00a0\nmy lips aren't super Blended in like I I\u00a0\u00a0\nwould just want a little bit of this guess\u00a0\nit would be better if I had a lip brush I\u00a0\u00a0\njust don't have any so we're just going\u00a0\nto use my fingers [Music] foreign [Music]\nthose two shades to get this kind of lip\u00a0\ncombination ombre situation and I really\u00a0\u00a0\ndo like it now for the eyes you can go into uh\u00a0\nusing her color fixes without an eyeshadow primer\u00a0\u00a0\nI just have always been in the habit as much\u00a0\nas I can remember to use one so I'm just going\u00a0\u00a0\nto go ahead and put a little bit of my about face\u00a0\neyeshadow primer on I wonder if you could use the\u00a0\u00a0\nuh bomb formulation on your eyes I'm sure you\u00a0\ncould because it is a primer and since all of\u00a0\u00a0\nour products are kind of multi-use I couldn't\u00a0\nsee why you wouldn't be able to use this\u00a0\u00a0\non your eyes the yummy skin yeah it says for face\u00a0\nand eyes so I could definitely see you using this\u00a0\u00a0\nas a primer for your base specifically for her\u00a0\ncolor fixes if you choose to so like I said I\u00a0\u00a0\nhave quite a few color fixes I'm pretty sure I\u00a0\nhave one more it's carrot it's the yellow orange\u00a0\u00a0\nit's a bright orange I guess I just forgot to\u00a0\npull it out but I have these and then I have the\u00a0\u00a0\nchocolate one alrighty so these are the\u00a0\ncolors like I said I also have a carrot\u00a0\u00a0\none which is more orange I don't think\u00a0\nI even really want to pull that one out\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm not going to worry about it I would\u00a0\nlove to put this one on though and maybe do\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe use these three colors so I have chocolate\u00a0\nrustic and then nude seven nude seven is the shade\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I used in the middle of my lips rustic\u00a0\nis the shade if you follow me for quite some\u00a0\u00a0\ntime I've used for a cream blush and absolutely\u00a0\nloved it and then chocolate is the new shade so\u00a0\u00a0\nI prefer when I'm gonna use a cream eyeshadow I'm\u00a0\ngoing to use a more synthetic brush that is just\u00a0\u00a0\nmy preference I prefer not to damage my natural\u00a0\nhair brushes but be great choose what you would\u00a0\u00a0\nwish I'm going to go ahead and start off my look\u00a0\nwith the shade chocolate and I'm just going to be\u00a0\u00a0\nusing my hand as kind of a canvas if you will so\u00a0\nI can mix and match and kind of build the shades\u00a0\u00a0\nas I wish so I'm just going to use this Angie\u00a0\nhot and flashy brush from BK Beauty this is the\u00a0\u00a0\na501 and I'm just going to start by building\u00a0\nthis outer V area and kind of getting a shape\u00a0\u00a0\nthe thing about her color fixes they are\u00a0\nbeautiful I find that they do not move once\u00a0\u00a0\nyou've put them down but because of that\u00a0\nyou can't really dilly dally in between\u00a0\u00a0\nputting it down and blending it out because if\u00a0\nyou do you are gonna get a crazy look or something\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's not as Blended as you wish it to so I\u00a0\nalways recommend either doing one eye at a time\nso I always recommend either doing one eye\u00a0\nat a time or just making sure you know what\u00a0\u00a0\nyou're going to do when you start your look\u00a0\nso that you can just go ahead and start the\u00a0\u00a0\nblending process you can build these up so that\u00a0\nif you didn't blend it the way you wanted or if\u00a0\u00a0\nit didn't come out the way you want you can kind\u00a0\nof go back and fix it but I'm always in the team\u00a0\u00a0\nof just getting it right the first time that way\u00a0\nyou don't have to make any corrections at all some\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is what the outer V is looking like\u00a0\nI also did take this chocolate shade and\u00a0\u00a0\nput it down on my lower lash line I will\u00a0\nbe blending out the whole edges a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit more probably with some translucent powder\u00a0\nbut I want to kind of get the look down then\u00a0\u00a0\nI have these two shades so I have The Rustic\u00a0\nand the nude seven I kind of want to go into\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Rustic and have that be a majority of my\u00a0\nlook this has been a favorite kind of a neutral\u00a0\u00a0\nnatural shade for me so I would love to kind\u00a0\nof just really blend that into chocolate and\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I'm already going to be blending the\u00a0\nshades together I'm just going to go ahead\u00a0\u00a0\nand use the exact same brush and just focus on\u00a0\ngetting this shade on my eyes and blending it in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe good thing about this formula like I said\u00a0\nit does dry down quite quickly and it's just\u00a0\u00a0\nreally nice it will blend out as you can see I've\u00a0\nBlended these into my crease and you can always\u00a0\u00a0\nadd on but what you can't do is take away so just\u00a0\nslowly build if you're not used to this formula\u00a0\u00a0\nand I would say less is more as always don't do a\u00a0\nthick layer I've never had an issue with that but\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know how that would feel on\u00a0\nyour eyes so I would just recommend\u00a0\u00a0\napplying less of the product and then kind\u00a0\nof going from there but as you can see\u00a0\u00a0\nthere's that nice dimensionality I think I'm\u00a0\ngoing to go back in with the chocolate shade\u00a0\u00a0\njust to really you know beef that section up but\u00a0\nI'm really liking this very simple easy easy look\u00a0\u00a0\nokay so I'm liking how everything is coming out so\u00a0\nfar I will be like I said blending out those outer\u00a0\u00a0\nedges a little bit better with some translucent\u00a0\npowder but I'll be doing that off camera so I\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to kind of get all the on camera stuff done\u00a0\nat the same time the last thing I really really\u00a0\u00a0\nwant to do with my eyes is go ahead and play with\u00a0\nthe nude seven shade this is the shade that I put\u00a0\u00a0\non my lips for a lip product and what I'm gonna do\u00a0\nis try to kind of put this in two places I want to\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of put this in the middle to slightly help\u00a0\nwith the blend and then also in my inner corner\u00a0\u00a0\nit's not as bright of an inner Corner\u00a0\nas I typically do but I think what\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm going to do is actually go ahead\u00a0\nand use some of the cream highlighter\nto emphasize that area so I feel like it kind\u00a0\nof helped with that blend because it felt like\u00a0\u00a0\nthat blend was still a little harsh between\u00a0\nthe two shades The Rustic and the chocolate\u00a0\u00a0\nshade and I feel like the nude 7 just really\u00a0\nhelped to kind of bring it all together even\u00a0\u00a0\nthough it's not you know it's not groundbreaking\u00a0\nor anything but it still feels like it helped so\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm just gonna work on getting this done\u00a0\nokay so that's it for all of the danessa\u00a0\u00a0\nmyrick's products I'm just gonna hop off to\u00a0\nfinish up my eye look I'm gonna put on some\u00a0\u00a0\nmascara I might actually put on a liner as well\u00a0\njust to tie this whole look together and then\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna come back so we can talk about all\u00a0\nof the products that I've showcased and just\u00a0\u00a0\noverall My Vibes and opinions when it comes\u00a0\nto the brand denessa myricks has created for\u00a0\u00a0\nus so give me one second I'll be right back\u00a0\nalrighty guys so this is the finished look\nlet's not judge my eye look too too much\u00a0\nI feel like there were some things that\u00a0\u00a0\nI learned throughout this tutorial um that\u00a0\ndefinitely allowed me to learn more about the\u00a0\u00a0\nthe nestomyrics products that I actually have\u00a0\nbut let's go through it like I always do just\u00a0\u00a0\nvery very quickly so first we have the primer and\u00a0\nthis is I don't think I actually said the original\u00a0\u00a0\nname it is the yummy skin Universal balm powder\u00a0\nproduct this came out in the same time that the\u00a0\u00a0\nyummy skin Foundation came out and that's why\u00a0\nI picked up both at the same time this has the\u00a0\u00a0\nupsolite formulation which is basically toted as\u00a0\na scientific ingredient or creation really that\u00a0\u00a0\nhelps to reduce oils in cosmetics products so that\u00a0\nwas a reason why I really like this I do find that\u00a0\u00a0\nthis helps to reduce my oils throughout the day\u00a0\nthis is a fantastic primer the only reason it's\u00a0\u00a0\nnot kind of a go-to is mainly the apply the\u00a0\napplication of it right so for this I have to\u00a0\u00a0\nactually get my hands dirty and really just rub\u00a0\nin on my face and don't get me wrong I am far\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom the one person that can say I hate using\u00a0\nmy hands to apply my makeup but if I'm going\u00a0\u00a0\nto do that I'd rather me not like contaminate\u00a0\nthe whole product every time I use it so it's\u00a0\u00a0\nvery kind of superficial reason why I don't reach\u00a0\nfor that very often but it is fantastic product\u00a0\u00a0\nI would recommend it and I am very happy to have\u00a0\nit in my collection then we have the foundation I\u00a0\u00a0\nlike the application I like the Finish pretty much\u00a0\neverything about this finish except for the shade\u00a0\u00a0\nrange I hate that I had to pick two different\u00a0\nshades to create my perfect shade and this is\u00a0\u00a0\ncoming from somebody who is pretty much always the\u00a0\nstereotypical one deep shade so that really tells\u00a0\u00a0\nyou kind of for me the shade rage isn't perfect\u00a0\nbut I am only one person one human being I do\u00a0\u00a0\nappreciate though that there is deeper Shades than\u00a0\nwhat I picked up and lighter Shades than what I\u00a0\u00a0\npicked up it does overall look like it is a good\u00a0\nshade range I'm just disappointed that I had to\u00a0\u00a0\npick up two different shades and for that matter\u00a0\nI don't think that that is the perfect foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nfor me in her range I think now looking back at it\u00a0\nI should have just picked up colored versions of\u00a0\u00a0\nthis as well and just kind of stuck with this\u00a0\nparticular formulation but either way I still\u00a0\u00a0\nthink it's a fantastic formula and I really do\u00a0\nlike it it's just you know the things that you\u00a0\u00a0\nlearn learn after having the products and really\u00a0\ngetting a good use out of them then let's go ahead\u00a0\u00a0\nand talk about some of the cream cheek products\u00a0\nthat I use today I used her balm Contour I really\u00a0\u00a0\ndo like this product but if you're somebody who\u00a0\nlikes a nice pigmented opaque application I would\u00a0\u00a0\nnot recommend this I would recommend her cream\u00a0\nbronzer this is for somebody who I think likes\u00a0\u00a0\na little bit more of an effortless bronze that\u00a0\njust kind of flows with the look and it's not\u00a0\u00a0\nsuper super obvious about it I do really like\u00a0\nthis shade I like the formula I like everything\u00a0\u00a0\nabout it it just is not as much of a kind of\u00a0\ngo-to favorite for me as her cream bronzer was\u00a0\u00a0\ncoming into one of the new products that I tried\u00a0\ntoday her blush formula this is the yummy skin\u00a0\u00a0\ngolden hour uh Cream Blush I love it I love it\u00a0\nso much I love how I didn't have to use very\u00a0\u00a0\nmuch product and it applied beautifully and\u00a0\ntypically for me if something applies really\u00a0\u00a0\neasily and quickly and opaquely like this with\u00a0\na sponge it's going to do the exact same thing\u00a0\u00a0\nwith the brush and so for me that versatility\u00a0\nthat kind of Duality that I get to choose what\u00a0\u00a0\nform of application I like is a positive for\u00a0\nme this is very very nice I really like it and\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah I can definitely see me picking up some\u00a0\nmore colors in this particular range I really\u00a0\u00a0\nlove Cream Blush though so that is that but yeah\u00a0\nvery very excited to potentially pick up a couple\u00a0\u00a0\nmore shades in that particular range then lastly\u00a0\nfor the cheeks we're I want to go ahead and talk\u00a0\u00a0\nabout her cream highlighter I will be honest out\u00a0\nof the three products that I have here to talk\u00a0\u00a0\nto you guys about I feel like this particular\u00a0\nformulation of cream highlighter isn't all that\u00a0\u00a0\nI like it and I've been able to figure out a way\u00a0\nto use it I think it works beautifully today and\u00a0\u00a0\nit has every time I've reached for it but it's not\u00a0\nlike an end-all be-all Holy Grail product if you\u00a0\u00a0\nreally wanted to do that she has some highlighter\u00a0\nproducts in tubes I can't think of the formulation\u00a0\u00a0\nname right now I think people really really\u00a0\nlike those and I would say that that's more of\u00a0\u00a0\na better bet of a traditional cream highlighter\u00a0\nthan this is I would say this is more of like a\u00a0\u00a0\num petroleum jelly-ish cream highlighter that\u00a0\nlike Tower 28 has and some other brands have\u00a0\u00a0\nthat you can find a use for it and you can even\u00a0\nuse it like under your highlighter not under your\u00a0\u00a0\neyelid under your foundation to kind of get an\u00a0\neffortless everyday look but it's definitely not\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething that traditionally a lot of people would\u00a0\nthink of as a highlighter because it really just\u00a0\u00a0\nhas that like lip from within look in certain\u00a0\nareas so yeah that's that when it comes to this\u00a0\u00a0\num yeah very very happy to have my collection\u00a0\npersonally I do like it but just know that going\u00a0\u00a0\nin it's not going to be a traditional highlighter\u00a0\nwhere you can see Shimmer or glitter or anything\u00a0\u00a0\nlike that it's really just gonna be like a\u00a0\nlow-key like a petroleum jelly that works\u00a0\u00a0\nwith a cream highlighter or can enhance I said\u00a0\na cream highlighter that can work with a powder\u00a0\u00a0\nhighlighter or can enhance a powder highlighter\u00a0\nthen the last products that I have to talk to\u00a0\u00a0\nyou guys about are her color fixes I still forgot\u00a0\nto look for the last shade let me look for that\u00a0\u00a0\nreally quickly all right so I have all of the\u00a0\nshades now I am up to a grand total of six shades\u00a0\u00a0\nfrom her color fix range and all of these with\u00a0\nare within her matte formulation of this range\u00a0\u00a0\nshe does also have a shimmer formulation just\u00a0\nnone of the shades have appealed to me I have\u00a0\u00a0\npicked up some that are in the nude range and\u00a0\nthen others that actually have colored names do\u00a0\u00a0\nknow that the ones that say nude you quite\u00a0\nliterally have to pick up from her website\u00a0\u00a0\nyou can't get those at Sephora or beautylish or\u00a0\nany other retailer you have to pick up the nude\u00a0\u00a0\nrange from her website that said all of the other\u00a0\nShades that I have you can pick up at all of those\u00a0\u00a0\nother Distributors and that's actually where I got\u00a0\nthem and I love them I love all of these I think\u00a0\u00a0\nthat they are a really nice product to add into\u00a0\nanybody's kind of normal traditional collection\u00a0\u00a0\nthat just wants to kind of get their feet wet with\u00a0\nher brand because these are products that you can\u00a0\u00a0\nuse quite literally everywhere so if you're\u00a0\nsomebody who likes to kind of experiment with\u00a0\u00a0\ncolored mascara eyeliner different cheek products\u00a0\nlip products brow colors whatever have you these\u00a0\u00a0\ncan be applied and work in all of those areas the\u00a0\nonly thing I would say is because of the actual\u00a0\u00a0\napplicator which is just the squeeze tube you\u00a0\nwill have to get like a spoolie or use your hand\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I did as a palette to kind of work with the\u00a0\ncolors that you have but other than that these are\u00a0\u00a0\na really nice formula I find that they dry down\u00a0\nvery much like a powder formulation different than\u00a0\u00a0\nthe cream blush the yummy skin I feel like this\u00a0\nhas a little bit more life to it it's a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit more kind of everyday whereas these I find to\u00a0\ngive quite literally a matte finish now if you're\u00a0\u00a0\nlooking at my eyes and you're saying sis those\u00a0\ndon't look matte they're not I don't know if I\u00a0\u00a0\nkept it in but I actually did just put the bomb\u00a0\non the middle and I will say I'm not loving what\u00a0\u00a0\nhappened there it looks like at least on one eye\u00a0\nthe color actually broke up which is disappointing\u00a0\u00a0\nbut this brings me kind of to my last thought when\u00a0\nit comes to danessa myrick's Brand I think that\u00a0\u00a0\nshe has really done well at doing what some other\u00a0\nmakeup artists have wanted to do with their brand\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich she brought her creativity her Artistry to\u00a0\nher brand and she basically said have at it do\u00a0\u00a0\nwhatever you want I'm going to give you different\u00a0\nformulas different application methods and you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan be great and with that knowledge and then her\u00a0\nclasses that she has available both for free and\u00a0\u00a0\nfor payment you can get so much information from\u00a0\nher as a makeup artist and that's something that\u00a0\u00a0\nI truly admire and truly love about her brand you\u00a0\nknow I would have probably never used these types\u00a0\u00a0\nof tubed products for eyeshadow for Cream Blush\u00a0\nfor lip products had it not really been for her\u00a0\u00a0\nbrand because of the way that they truly Market\u00a0\nit I've seen applications of Vanessa myrick's\u00a0\u00a0\nliterally applying uh blush with a more fluffy\u00a0\nbrush so something like this where it's fluffy\u00a0\u00a0\nand she's shown it and you can really see\u00a0\nhow using a different brush even a slightly\u00a0\u00a0\ndifferent technique like if you under paint and\u00a0\nthen you apply your foundation on top which I\u00a0\u00a0\nwent through a phase and that's what I did you can\u00a0\nreally see how it just effortlessly effortlessly\u00a0\u00a0\ncomes together and it looks a lot more natural\u00a0\nand every day than maybe applying all of your\u00a0\u00a0\nbase products over your foundation and so I just\u00a0\ntruly enjoy this brand because of that she really\u00a0\u00a0\nbreaks down the Artistry application and makes\u00a0\nit kind of everyday proof for those of people\u00a0\u00a0\nlike me who just like to play sometimes and you\u00a0\nknow sometimes you play and you mess up just like\u00a0\u00a0\nI do with my eye look and that's okay because the\u00a0\ngood thing about makeup is you can always take it\u00a0\u00a0\noff try again later that day or the next day so\u00a0\nyeah that's pretty much all I have to talk about\u00a0\u00a0\nI hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope it was a\u00a0\ngood kind of highlight of the brand definitely let\u00a0\u00a0\nme know if you have a different products from the\u00a0\nbrand and you love them and you would recommend\u00a0\u00a0\nthem or if you have similar products to me and you\u00a0\nhate them comment down below let everybody know in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe community my opinion is not word I just like\u00a0\nto kind of get my opinion out there and show you\u00a0\u00a0\nguys what I feel and how it works for me just\u00a0\nso that any event you're having

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

                "comment": "Sorry for the long comment in advance!!  I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

She lies about the false lashes and then didn&#39;t respond about it at all and she hid the sponsored statement and doubled down on her lies and made a joke out of her actions in subsequent videos. She has used filters too.  She has yet to apologize and she shouldn&#39;t be given the benefit of the doubt at all. That ship sailed.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

        "transcript_text": "- Hello beautiful creatures.\nWelcome back to my channel Phyrra.\nI'm so grateful you're here.\nMy name's Cordelia and on\nmy channel I love to talk\nabout indie makeup, gothic\nfashion, mental health, poodles\nlifestyle and more.\nSo if these are things\nthat you're interested in\nplease do me a favor and hit\nthat like button right now\nand don't forget to\nsubscribe so you can join\nin the conversation.\nSo today's video is going to\nbe a quick little fun tutorial\nfeaturing Aromaleigh and\nSilk Naturals and Lime Crime.\nI'm using the Phaedra blush\nand this new lip color\nthat I picked up from NYX\ncosmetics and a couple\nother new products that\nI wanted to try out.\nSo if you want to see how\nI put together this fun\nlittle purple one, just keep watching.\nI've already put on my eyeshadow primer.\nIt's the Concrete Minerals\nglitter Eye primer.\nI'm now going to use the Lime\nCrime Electric slide Pencil\nin the shade, Whatever.\nIt's like a pinky purple.\nAnd I'm going to put this\nall over my lid, my crease.\nI'm gonna bring it up here\nat the inner part of my eye\n(upbeat music)\nextending it past my outer\nlid a little bit just\nto help me deal with my excess\nskin from my hooded eyes.\nAnd I'm gonna run it\nAll along my lower lid.\nI'm using the Sigma E27\nto just blend the edges\nof the cream eyeshadow.\nThis product also blends\nout real easily with your fingertips.\nI own a bunch of the colors\nof these 'cause I really like the format.\nSuppose I should do a swatch video\nin all of the shades that I have.\nI'm going to use my Fenty powder in 105\nand this is a pencil\nbrush and this is just to\nblend the very, very edges\nof that Lime Crime shade.\nI'm going to take the\ncolor Aromaleigh Tiny Bluet\nand this is a lethal\ncosmetics pencil brush\nwhich is like very, not\nvery much a pencil brush.\nIt's more like a like it's\nvery what I would call loose.\nI don't know, like it's not\nvery tightly compacted head.\nAnd I'm putting this at the\nouter part of like my lid\nand dragging to kind of create\nlike a slight wing shape.\nAnd I'm also gonna put\nthis along my lower lid\nMost of the way across the bottom.\nYeah, this is more like a\ndiffused pencil brush for me\nbut that's okay.\nWe can make it work.\nThe next color I'm going to\nuse is Aromaleigh Desideratum.\nI probably said that wrong.\nSo I'm gonna have the\nthe word up on the screen\nfor you to see the name of it.\nAnd I'm going to put this\non the rest of my lid.\nAnd I'm using a Sigma\nMedium sweeper brush.\nThis is an ultra sparkly\ncolor with highly reflective\nlike blue shimmer.\nI think it's really pretty.\nI know, I know pastels\nfor spring groundbreaking.\nAnd I'm going to take the\nAromaleigh Color Phaedra\nwhich is a deep violet\npurple, angled eyeshadow brush\nfrom Sydney Grace Cosmetics.\nAnd I'm just basically\ngoing to draw 'cause I don't\nwant it to be too heavy on the outer part\nof my upper lid creating a wing.\nI'm doing it just along the outer corner\nof the lower lid too.\nI am gonna use this Q-tip\nto just sort of shape it.\nI'm back with a brush that\nI applied the bluet color\nand just blend it over the top\nof this to make sure it's not too harsh.\nI'm going to apply my\nThrive Causemetics mascara\nin the Deep Blue Shade Nola.\n(upbeat music continues)\nI'm going to apply LA Girl\nScreamin neon yellow highlighter\non the lower water line 'cause\nI thought that would be fun\nfor a pop of contrast with\nthe pink and blue purple.\nI have the yellow.\nAll right, now let's\ngo onto the complexion.\nI'm really, really excited\nbecause I'm going to\nbe using the Silk Naturals\nPhaedra blush today.\nBut to start, we're gonna\nput on Danessa Myricks\nthe Prism FX Hydrating\nLotion in the shade Gold.\nI'm trying a new complexion product today.\nThis is from Idun Minerals.\nThey sent me this.\nIt is their moisturizing mineral skin tint\nand the color is light.\nSo we'll see how it works for me.\nI'm excited to try it.\nIdun Minerals has had\nseveral different foundations\nthat have worked really well for me.\nThey had their Norrsken\nand their Nordic Veil\nand both of those had the shade Jorunn\nand it was a great match for my fair skin.\nThey also made a tinted day cream\nwhich worked really well for me as well.\nI find that their products\nin general are more coverage\nthan I'm usually looking\nfor in a foundation, which\nunless you like, thin 'em out.\n(upbeat music continues)\nNow this looks like it's\na little bit dark for me.\nI'll make sure to insert photos or video\nof me outside so you can see what it looks\nlike in natural light\nto see how it matches.\nSo this is the new\nfoundation that I received\nfrom Idun Minerals.\nI think it just looks\nlike it's just a shade\nor two, too dark for me.\nIt was a little bit too dark.\nOh, and I'm applying this\nwith the NYX Cosmetics.\nBear with me.\nBlur Foundation Brush.\nI bought this after the people\nat NYX told me I just didn't, you know\napply their blur foundation correctly\nand I needed the right brush.\nSo I bought the brush to\ngive it a try and still\ndidn't have particularly great\nresults, but that's okay.\nI'll put a link to that video\nif you wanna check it out.\nLooks to me like it's maybe a shade\nor two darker than my skin tone\nbut I don't know if\nthat's visible on camera.\nAll right.\nSo I'm going to start with\nSilk Natural's Instinct\nwhich is the deeper purple\nwith strong blue duo chrome shift blush.\nI'm putting this along the\nbottom of my cheekbone.\nAnd now I'm going to go in with Phaedra\nwhich is the lighter purple duo chrome.\n(upbeat music continues)\nAnd I'm gonna start\nmixing these on the cheek.\nAnd I'm just using this brush\nfrom Colored Rain to blend my edges.\nI love that.\nI love this so much, it's just\nit makes me so happy that this\ncolor is just so beautiful.\nI'm going to highlight\nwith Silk Natural's Blue Raspberry and I'm\nusing this the Sigma Samantha\nRavendal highlighter brush.\nI am going to set my face\nwith the Silk Naturals\nmelt powder in light.\nIt's a makeup setting\npowder that helps all\nof the things on your\nface melt together to look\nlike your skin a bit better.\nNow for my lips, I'm\ngoing to outline my lips\nin the lip pencil Tarot by Lime Crime.\nAnd I'm going to try\nthis lip color from NYX\ncalled Berry Bed Sheets.\nI really love the color of\nthis lip color, but I found it.\nI found it kind of difficult\nto apply, but I think I'm to\nput on a couple face gems just\nto kind of finish this look.\n'Cause I think it'll be\nfun to add a little bit\nof extra sparkle.\nAnd this is just a face gem\nset that I bought from Amazon\nfor really cheap.\nAll right, I'm just\nsticking this on my face.\nIt's just like this little pink one.\nSo I'm basically putting\na medium sized one\ntowards the outer corner\nand then I'm putting the\nsmallest size that comes on\nthis towards the tail.\nSo, what do you think?\nI put some little cute gems on.\nAlright, so let me zoom in\nso you can see the finished look up close.\nSo here's my finished eye look\nwith Aromaleigh, and\nLime Crime and LA girl.\nHopefully you can see all\nof the pretty color shifts.\nWhat do we think of the\nPhaedra and Instinct blushes?\nI love how it blends out effortlessly.\nSo I hope you love this\nfun purple makeup tutorial\nfeaturing Aromaleigh and Silk Naturals.\nPlease be sure to let\nyou know your thoughts\nin the comments below.\nIf you have any color combination request\nbeautiful creatures, don't\nhesitate to reach out.\nI'd be happy to create them for you.\nThank you so much for watching.\nI love you and I'll see you next time.\nBye.\n(upbeat music

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

                "comment": "Sorry for the long comment in advance!!  I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I fell for it too many times. <br><br>I\u2019ve heard a few Youtubers talk about products that they want to try but they wouldn\u2019t purchase and immediately turn around and ask the brand to send them it as PR. I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on. It just makes me look at them differently.**",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on.

a Scottish skincare\u00a0\nbrand it's vegan cruelty free and organic and\u00a0\u00a0\nit is made using hebridean seaweed discover the\u00a0\npower of organic seaweed skincare the name ishkar\u00a0\u00a0\nis derived from the Gaelic word for water the\u00a0\nPure Clean Waters of the hebridean islands off\u00a0\u00a0\nthe northwest coast of Scotland are home to ishkar\u00a0\nwhere they sustainably hand harvest the four types\u00a0\u00a0\nof seaweed that are at the heart of the organic\u00a0\nskin care range so heberdeen seaweed contains\u00a0\u00a0\npotent natural antioxidants with properties that\u00a0\ntransform and protect the skin they've developed\u00a0\u00a0\na bespoke process to extract the natural goodness\u00a0\nhands in an abundance of vitamins and bioactive\u00a0\u00a0\nminerals to create a remarkable range of high\u00a0\nperforming products that deliver efficacy for\u00a0\u00a0\nall skin types not only do ishkar have their\u00a0\nown website where they also sell all of their\u00a0\u00a0\nproducts they are also stocked in Harrods of all\u00a0\nplaces which is High Praise indeed I think that's\u00a0\u00a0\npretty impressive so in this video we're going to\u00a0\nhave a look at four of the products in the range\u00a0\u00a0\nwhich I've been using now for two weeks I'm going\u00a0\nto show you what they look like what they are and\u00a0\u00a0\nI'll talk to you about my experience using them\u00a0\nso hopefully you can decide if this is a skincare\u00a0\u00a0\nbrand for you so the first products I've been\u00a0\nusing in the routine is the exfoliating face wash\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is soil Association organic it's made with\u00a0\n88 organic ingredients and this is a full size\u00a0\u00a0\nit's a glass bottle and it's 100 ml or 3.38 fluid\u00a0\nounce it's got like a metal cap on it and it's got\u00a0\u00a0\nlike a little pump style dispenser on there this\u00a0\nit recommends you pour a small amount into the\u00a0\u00a0\npalm of your hand mixed with water and cleanse\u00a0\nthe face now I found with this product I didn't\u00a0\u00a0\nneed much water there was enough in there without\u00a0\ntoo much water to just really give my face a nice\u00a0\u00a0\ncleanse so I like to use this in the morning and\u00a0\nor as like a second cleanse at night so I wouldn't\u00a0\u00a0\nsay it's like a makeup removing cleanser it's just\u00a0\nmore of a treat your face cleanser but because\u00a0\u00a0\nit's exfoliating it's got this really gentle\u00a0\nalmost imperceptible scrubbiness to it so you can\u00a0\u00a0\nhopefully see the little bits that exist within it\u00a0\nthat are super super gentle but it's just it's a\u00a0\u00a0\nreally nice one to use I don't feel like you need\u00a0\ntoo much products and my skin felt really kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nsoft afterwards and balanced like some cleansers\u00a0\nyou use and you feel like your Skin's a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit drier afterwards you need to put the moisture\u00a0\nback in this just made it feel kind of balanced\u00a0\u00a0\nand soft and yeah it's a really nice cleanser so\u00a0\nthis is 28 pounds they do offer lots of different\u00a0\u00a0\ncleansers in the range and that I will mention\u00a0\nas I go along so we've got like a serum and an\u00a0\u00a0\neye cream and a moisturizer and stuff to look at\u00a0\nbut they do a few different ones so it depends\u00a0\u00a0\nI guess what appeals most to you so this retails\u00a0\nat 28 pounds I've said I've used it for two weeks\u00a0\u00a0\npretty much twice a day and you can see I haven't\u00a0\nused that much of the products I've been using\u00a0\u00a0\nabout three to four pumps and but a little seems\u00a0\nto go a long way and yeah it's just been a really\u00a0\u00a0\nnice product to use so I will continue to use this\u00a0\nbut that's been really nice ishka exfoliating face\u00a0\u00a0\nwash quickly removes daily Grime and pollution\u00a0\nfrom your skin leaving it smooth soft and\u00a0\u00a0\nradiant this luxurious natural face wash contains\u00a0\nhebridean seaweed extract it's full of vitamins\u00a0\u00a0\nminerals essential fatty acid in antioxidants to\u00a0\nheal and restore tired dull skin it also contains\u00a0\u00a0\nseaweed cow grains hebrity and spring water skin\u00a0\nsoftening cocoa butter like jojoba oil and vitamin\u00a0\u00a0\nE is suitable for all genders and skin types\u00a0\nand the fine seaweed grains gently exfoliates\u00a0\u00a0\nand remove dead skin cells to reveal a healthy\u00a0\nradiant appearance and their regenerative effects\u00a0\u00a0\nof our nutritious blend of natural skincare\u00a0\ningredients suits all skin types giving a more\u00a0\u00a0\nyouthful appearance next up one of their best\u00a0\nsellers and definitely a massive standout for\u00a0\u00a0\nme this is the regenerating face serum made\u00a0\nwith 92 organic ingredients 50 ml 1.69 fluid\u00a0\u00a0\nounce and again this one's got like a pump on it\u00a0\nand you can kind of work out how much you've used\u00a0\u00a0\nand where you're up to because the packaging is\u00a0\nlifting up as you're using it so I'm up to about\u00a0\u00a0\nthat I've been using it every night but not in the\u00a0\nnot during the day it's more of like a nighttime\u00a0\u00a0\nserum I would say this retails at 67 pounds and\u00a0\nit says the ishka regenerating or organic face\u00a0\u00a0\nserum is a pure natural serum made with a high\u00a0\nconcentration of hebridian seaweed extract proven\u00a0\u00a0\nto regenerate the skin cells and hebridium\u00a0\nsea water now I would mention about this it\u00a0\u00a0\ndoes smell like seaweed which took a little bit of\u00a0\ngetting used to to start with because I'm not used\u00a0\u00a0\nto that I guess I'm probably used to fragrance and\u00a0\nthings in products because this was something else\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I guess the fact that it's got such a high\u00a0\nconcentration of the seaweed is what is actually\u00a0\u00a0\ndoing something because this is one of those\u00a0\nserums that when you apply this to your face you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan feel the skin tightening so it actually feels\u00a0\nlike it is doing something our hebridean seaweed\u00a0\u00a0\nextract and clean Scottish sea water Empower this\u00a0\nclever serum to brighten tighten and firm the skin\u00a0\u00a0\nreducing the look of lines and wrinkles naturally\u00a0\nit delivers immediate results through a high\u00a0\u00a0\nconcentration of seaweed and your skin will feel\u00a0\nimmediately nourished and soothed too with no oil\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Skin Care Wonder contains only pure organic\u00a0\nseaweed and salt water simply take a few pumps\u00a0\u00a0\nonto your fingertips press over the face and neck\u00a0\nand under the eye area activate the serum with\u00a0\u00a0\nrain drop pressure motions until it's absorbed\u00a0\ninto the skin then the rejuvenating eye balm again\u00a0\u00a0\nin a little glass pot with a metal lid so this is\u00a0\na super lightweight eye cream but it does kind of\u00a0\u00a0\ntake a little bit of working into the skin to get\u00a0\nit to sink in it almost has a slightly not grainy\u00a0\u00a0\ntexture but it just looks slightly different to\u00a0\nother eye creams and things I've used I think it's\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause it's a natural product so they're trying\u00a0\nto only use ingredients that they need to use\u00a0\u00a0\nthey're using organic ingredients they're using\u00a0\nall these good things and I think because it's\u00a0\u00a0\nnot got the chemicals in that I probably have in\u00a0\nmy usual eye creams it's just the texture is ever\u00a0\u00a0\nslightly different but it does sink well into the\u00a0\nskin once it's on there and you've kind of like\u00a0\u00a0\npatted it in they suggest to kind of do it in this\u00a0\nsort of motion and I found it's not caused any\u00a0\u00a0\nirritation which is a real concern for me because\u00a0\na lot of eye creams do irritate particularly above\u00a0\u00a0\nmy eyes I like to put them on my brow bone there\u00a0\nand this one didn't this one was great and it also\u00a0\u00a0\nwas really good when I put like my concealer and\u00a0\nstuff on afterwards it did moisturize the skin you\u00a0\u00a0\nthat it wasn't all settling into the lines that's\u00a0\nalways how I kind of say if an eye cream is good\u00a0\u00a0\nif if my concealer and stuff is like settling\u00a0\ninto lines and looking a bit dry and things it's\u00a0\u00a0\nprobably because the eye cream isn't quite good\u00a0\nenough or isn't quite good enough for what I need\u00a0\u00a0\nso this one is a 30 mil eye balm which I mean I\u00a0\nwouldn't have called it a bar I wouldn't say it's\u00a0\u00a0\na balm texture it's more of a cream than a balm\u00a0\nbut 30 ml for an eye cream is huge so I looked at\u00a0\u00a0\nmy other eye creams and they're pretty much all 15\u00a0\nmL so this is twice the size of your average eye\u00a0\u00a0\ncream which makes the 49 pounds it cost quite\u00a0\nkind of cost effective because it should last\u00a0\u00a0\ntwice as long as any other eye cream so this this\u00a0\ncan be going for some time so yeah really decent\u00a0\u00a0\nsize that for an eye cream it says the organic\u00a0\neye balm is a soothing restorative natural eye\u00a0\u00a0\nbalm rich in nourishing ingredients and true to\u00a0\nishkar's Mission to create Innovative organic\u00a0\u00a0\nskincare products and the best in cruelty free\u00a0\nBeauty a good

it's been used\u00a0\nfor centuries to know Irish and hydrate it's\u00a0\u00a0\nbursting with vitamins A and E to help turn around\u00a0\npremature wrinkles and Fine Lines it also

got ingredients like cinnamic acid\u00a0\u00a0\nand natural sunscreen to protect fine skin halting\u00a0\nsun damage and new wrinkles and the final products\u00a0\u00a0\nI've got to show you today is the balancing Marine\u00a0\ncream so do a few different Marine creams and they\u00a0\u00a0\nsay they can all be used by all skin types but\u00a0\nyou can kind of choose which one you think you\u00a0\u00a0\nwould like to use the most so it says apply to\u00a0\ncleansed skin daily for best results apply after\u00a0\u00a0\nthe exfoliating face wash which is what I've been\u00a0\ndoing obviously after my serum as well made the\u00a0\u00a0\n70 organic ingredients soil Association organic\u00a0\nand yeah this is a 50 ml again it's got the glass\u00a0\u00a0\ncontainer and the metal lid and this one has got\u00a0\na nice kind of whipped sort of texture to it so\u00a0\u00a0\nit's quite thick it isn't just going to like fall\u00a0\nout if you do that and when you apply it to the\u00a0\u00a0\nskin it sinks in really well even though it's got\u00a0\nthat kind of whipped texture to it it feels really\u00a0\u00a0\nnice on the skin it sinks in well so it's not\u00a0\nlike one of those where you lie down with your\u00a0\u00a0\nhead on the pillow at night and go and stick to\u00a0\nthe pillow it doesn't do that at all I've also\u00a0\u00a0\napplied makeup on top of it I've got makeup on\u00a0\ntoday obviously and stuff so it applies well on\u00a0\u00a0\ntop of this no issues at all with that it smells\u00a0\nreally nice it's got like a kind of herbal essent\u00a0\u00a0\nto it I like it this one the 50ml is 60 pounds\u00a0\nbut you can try a 30 mil for 39 pounds so do\u00a0\u00a0\nsort of slightly smaller versions of some of the\u00a0\nproducts if you want to kind of try before you buy\u00a0\u00a0\nthe bigger one it says our award-winning Marine\u00a0\ncreams are suitable for everyone and you can\u00a0\u00a0\nchoose the best the one that best suited to your\u00a0\nskin type based on its ingredients and benefits a\u00a0\u00a0\npowerful blend of clean skincare ingredients it\u00a0\nincludes ishkar seaweed extracts and

clean and fresh\u00a0\nsensual aromatic oils of Bergamot sandalwood and\u00a0\u00a0\nPatchouli add a soothing refreshing scent to lift\u00a0\nyour spirits and calm your senses so again this\u00a0\u00a0\none a little goes a long way like I said I've been\u00a0\nusing this now for two weeks and there's still a\u00a0\u00a0\nheck of a lot of product left whether I use it\u00a0\nmorning or night it's been it's been great so\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm actually really impressed I don't usually use\u00a0\nkind of organic type products not for any reason\u00a0\u00a0\nother than I don't know it's just not something\u00a0\nI bought before I like the fact that it's cruelty\u00a0\u00a0\nfree and vegan and I love the fact that it's made\u00a0\nwith this like natural ingredient that's seaweed\u00a0\u00a0\nI just think all that just makes it a really cool\u00a0\nexperience but I have also been really impressed\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I said with the effects I've only used it two\u00a0\nweeks but I can feel the tightening of the serum\u00a0\u00a0\neverything's sinking in nicely everything is nice\u00a0\nto use and yeah it's just kind of come become like\u00a0\u00a0\na part of my routine so I'm pretty impressed I'm\u00a0\nglad they sent me these products to try so that\u00a0\u00a0\nis my experience of using these products the last\u00a0\ntwo weeks let me know in the

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

She has used filters too.  She has yet to apologize and she shouldn&#39;t be given the benefit of the doubt at all. That ship sailed.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

        "description": "Hello, beautiful creatures! Today's video is on the Axiology Multisticks. I demo these products for the first time, doing swatches on my eyes, cheeks and lips. I applaud Axiology for being plastic-free and using recycled trash as packaging, which can then be further recycled. I love seeing the push for recyclable or refillable packaging and wish more brands would embrace this.\n\nAxiology multisticks are for people who like the no-makeup makeup look, for people who like monochromatic makeup, minimal makeup, or a slightly messy, grungy, imperfect undone look. \n\nI'm not personally a fan of no-makeup makeup or minimal makeup, but I know some of you are. I love bold and bright colors. I'm also not a fan of anything that doesn't set on my eyes. Because I have oily, hooded eyelids, if things don't set completely they crease and become a mess on me.\n\nI'm bare faced in this video except for my skin care and my brows.\n\nWhile these products are not to my personal taste, I can see buying these for friends who like minimal makeup to no makeup makeup. I would not purchase these for myself.\n\nAXIOLOGY \nhttps://shrsl.com/3vqlm code CORDELIA for 20% off\n\nAXIOLOGY AT ULTA\nhttps://rstyle.me/+4L5mcitulGMaBLOQWxE3mg\n\nMY SKIN CARE ROUTINE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrW_a2ymFYA&t\n\nCHAPTERS\n00:00 Introduction\n00:07 About Axiology\n04:00 Axiology Lip-to-Lid Balmie \n06:06 Axiology Multi-sticks\n09:50 Axiology Tinted Mult-stick\n11:12 Final Thoughts\n\n\ud83e\udd87 SUBSCRIBE & JOIN THE HEX SQUAD \ud83e\udd87 https://bit.ly/PhyrrasHexSquadYT\nClosed Captioning by Rev.com in English.

        "transcript_text": "- Hello beautiful creatures.\nI'm so grateful you're here.\nWelcome back to my channel, Phyrra.\nIf you're new here, my name's Cordelia.\nSo today's video,\nis going to basically\nbe a swatch and try on\nof the indie makeup brand Axiology.\nThis is a brand that used to be on Etsy\nand you can now find them at Ulta\nand they have leaned hard\ninto the 100% recyclable packaging.\nThey are plastic free, which is awesome.\nSo Axiology says that they are\nclean, vegan, cruelty-free, and natural.\nAnd just so you are aware,\nthe USA does not regulate\nany of those terms.\nSo let me tell you what Axiology\nsays they mean by those terms.\nAnd I'm just going to read\noff my phone really fast.\nSo what Axiology means by clean is\nthat in their 10 ingredients,\nthey are all natural and 100% proven safe.\nVegan for Axiology means staying away\nfrom anything that harms\nanimals directly or indirectly\nand has no animal ingredients\nwhich is one of the reasons\nthat they avoid palm oil.\nCruelty-free to them means\nno testing the ingredients,\nno animal testing in manufacturing\nand it also means that they don't sell\nin countries that require animal testing.\nAnd for the term natural\nAxiology means that\nthese are ingredients that\nare only derived from nature.\nAxiology is a PETA certified\ncruelty-free indie brand.\nSo as I mentioned, Axiology\nis a clean beauty brand\nand I'm somebody who really\ndoesn't like the term\nclean beauty because I feel\nlike it's very gimmicky\nand they mention on their site that they\ndon't use any synthetic preservatives\nbut they do use natural preservatives.\nSo I went and looked into\nwhat those natural preservatives are.\nAxiology uses elderberry\nextract and neem oil\nas their two natural preservatives.\nAnd it looks like the shelf\nlife of their products\nis 24 months.\nSo I guess that means from\nthe time you open them\nuntil 24 months, they should be good,\nthis is my understanding at least.\nSince this question has come\nup a few times on my channel,\nI also looked into this,\nAxiology says that they\nare child cruelty free\nwith their mica and they buy their mica\nfrom suppliers who are part\nof this like child cruelty free movement.\nSo that means that they don't\nbuy any mica that's from\nSouth Africa or India.\nSo this is something I didn't know\nuntil I started researching Axiology,\nthe beauty industry\ncreates 128 billion pounds\nor 120 billion units of\nplastic waste per year.\nWhich is just crazy to me to think about,\nlike that's unfathomable.\nAnd apparently over a hundred\nmillion marine animals\ndie a year because of this plastic,\nwhich is really upsetting.\nSo because of all of the\nanimal lives that are lost\nfrom the single-use plastic stuff\nand I guess a myriad of other things,\nAxiology has changed to\nhave all of their packaging\nbe eco-friendly and\nthere's no plastic in it\nand it's all recyclable.\nThey made this change in 2022\nand they partner with women\nin Bali to pick up local like\nstreet trash in Bali\nand they use that to\ncreate their packaging.\nSo here's what one of their\nlittle packages looks like\nfor one of their little pencils.\nAnd this is like the\npackaging to keep it safe\nand secure like in your makeup collection,\nin your purse, or whatever.\nAnd then they also have\nmakeup that is like this\nwhich is more of like a\ntraditional lipstick style.\nSo when I was looking into Axiology\nit seems like they started off on Etsy\nas a handmade brand from Oregon\nand they have since expanded to where\nthey're still handmade in\nOregon but they are big enough\nthat they're able to be in\nUlta, which is pretty cool.\nThey have, like I mentioned,\nthis really nice eco-friendly packaging.\nNow if you were somebody like me\nand you have oily, hooded eyelids\nand what that means is I've\ngot all of this excess skin\nthat folds down over my\nmobile lid right here.\nThen I don't recommend\nthat you use these products on your eyes.\nI know for me I can't use\na product that does not set\non my eyes because what\nhappens is it turns creasey\nand turns into a real mess.\nNow if you were looking\nfor makeup to give you\nthat slightly grungy lived\nin slightly creasy look\nthis may be perfect for you.\nIf you don't have hooded eyes,\nthis may be perfect for you.\nAnd by the way, Axiology created a 20% off\ncoupon code for you with\nthe name Cordelia, my name.\nSo if you wanna go to their site\nand check out any of their products\nand maybe consider purchasing one you can,\njust use that code, it'll save you money.\nAnd if not, that's cool too,\nyou know, they're at Ulta as well.\nSo the first product that\nI'm going to demo for you\nis the Lip-to-Lid lip\ncolor Balmie in Champagne.\nWhich I think it looks really adorable,\nso here is Champagne in\nits little packaging.\nNow because this is a like\nswatch and try it out video,\nI am gonna put all these colors\non my eyes just for you to see.\nBut I'm telling you this is\nnot how I would wear them\njust because I can't stand\nstuff that doesn't set.\nSo I'm going to.\nI feel like this is like barely visible.\nSo lemme see what Axiology\nsays about this product.\nAxiology says that this is good for people\nwho want a moisturizing,\nsemi-matte highlighter.\nAnd this contains 0.12 ounces of product\nand it's a golden sparkling\nwine with subtle dewy glow.\nThe kokum butter and\nsunflower wax create a drier\nor more matte feel for the Balmies\nwhich contribute to a\nlong-lasting product.\nIt's great for people with\noily skin or who use face oils.\nAll right,\nso I don't feel like you can\nsee this at all in my eyes.\nI'm going to try putting this on my lips\nand my lips are a little\nstained from yesterday.\nOkay, I feel like you can just barely see,\nit gives like a little,\nlittle subtle glow on my lips.\nAnd I feel like maybe you can see there's\nlike a little subtle shimmer going on.\nAll right, so I don't feel like\nChampagne is very visible on me at all,\nbut I'm extremely fair complected\nand I often feel like I need more\nof a blinding highlighter to\nget it to show up to my taste.\nBut here we go, this is Champagne.\nOkay, so the next product\nI'm going to demo for you\nis the Axiology Multi-Stick\nand this color is called Clarity.\nAnd let me read to you what\nit says about this product.\nIt says that the\nMulti-Sticks are described\nas having nourishing color in\nan extremely creamy formula.\nPlant butters and oil such\nas soy butter and coconut oil\ndeeply penetrate skin for\nlong-lasting hydration\nwith a rich and creamy formula,\nour rich and creamy finish,\nnaturally derived vegan and cruelty-free.\nIt's made with only 10 simple ingredients.\nAnd these are good for people\nwho want rich, creamy color\nand they're different from Balmies\nbecause they work better with dry skin.\nAnd it's $24.\nThis is the color Clarity,\nwhich is described as\na bold, berry fuchsia\nwith a touch of red.\nOh, pushup, yeah, it's like a\npushup stick, like a popsicle.\nYou push up the bottom\nto get the product to rise up to the top.\nNow as I mentioned\nthis is not a product I would\nnormally wear in my eyes\nbut for the purpose of this video,\nwe're gonna put some of\nthis color on my eyes.\nYou know this might be okay\non hooded eyes if you use a primer\nand then you set it with like\na translucent setting powder.\nSo let's put on the cheeks\nand I'm just gonna grab a brush\nto help me blend a little better.\nLet's try it on the lips.\nI don't really get berry\nhues with Clarity here.\nI feel like I definitely see red.\nI do feel like my lips gimme a little bit\nof that like Popsicle\nstick like I just had\nlike a red Popsicle or something.\nSo this is clarity.\nThe next color I'm gonna\nshare with you is called\nTrue and it's described as a deep scarlet\nand it looks very similar in the tube\nto the Clarity shade\nthat we just looked at.\nSo let's swipe this on my eyes again.\nI feel like on my skin tone\nthese colors pull very warm.\nI do like the appeal though.\nIf you're somebody who just likes to\ndo monochromatic looks,\nI do find that appealing.\nThat's one of the things I loved\nabout the Bite Beauty MultiSticks\nexcept they had cooler tones like Kava.\nSo this is True, the deep scarlet\non my eyes, cheeks, and lips.\nI don't know that I would\ndescribe this as a deep color\nbecause to me it looks\nvery, looks more like bright\nwhich is okay 'cause I know I like brights\nbut I definitely feel\nlike it looks really warm.\nLike there's like a lot of like\norangey red tones going on.\nSo the next color I have to\nshow you is called Worth.\nIt's a flaming, red orange\nwith a surprising pink twist.\nAnd this is what it looks like.\nThis one definitely looks the most orange\nof the three that we've seen.\nI had to put some moisturizer on my skin\nin between this and the last\nset of swatches that I did\n'cause my skin was getting irritated.\nMy skin does not like it when I do a bunch\nof like face swatches.\nMy rosacea gets really mad.\nSo this is Worth, the orange.\nAll right, so the last\nproduct I have to show you\nis from their tinted line.\nAnd this is more for people\nwho are into no makeup makeup.\nLet me tell you what it says\nabout this particular line.\nSo these are $24\nand these are nourishing color\nmeets dewy-hydration in this\nplastic-free multi-stick\nfor a glowing hint of color,\nnaturally derived ingredients such\nas coconut oil and soy\nbutter penetrate skin\nfor a deep hydrating and\nglowing, dewy finish.\nThis is good for people\nwho want a dewier, no-makeup makeup look.\nThe color Ethos is a taupey plum\nthat changes color in the light.\nIn the tube, it looks straight\nup brown, like a brown taupe.\nAnd they weren't kidding when\nthey said it's very light.\nI feel like it gives\nthe barest tint of color\non my skin even if I'm like going over it\nlike a million times.\nI am definitely not the poster\nchild for no makeup makeup.\nLike I like my light coverage foundation,\nI like to have like a my\nskin but better foundation.\nBut I like my eyeshadow and\nmy lips to be like there,\ni want you to know it's there.\nSo this is Ethos, the taupey plum.\nAll right.\nSo I hope that you enjoyed\nmy little swatch and demo\nof the Axiology products on\nmy eyes, cheeks, and lips\neven though I normally\ndon't do things like that.\nMy skin is very irritated now,\nmy rosacea is very unhappy\nwith me for doing that,\nbut I'm really excited that\nI got to demo these products\nfor you and show you what\nthey look like on me.\nI'm definitely not somebody\nwho does the no makeup makeup.\nThe only thing close that I get\nor the only way I get\nclose to no makeup makeup\nis I really do like my foundation\nto look like it's a my skin, but better.\nVery minimal coverage,\njust basically to cover up\nlike blur out some imperfections\nand even out my skin tone and\njust make my skin look great.\nLike that's pretty much\nall I want the foundation.\nSo I'm not really into\nthe no makeup makeup\nbut I really like and respect the fact\nthat Axiology has this awesome,\neco-friendly packaging.\nThe 24 month shelf life is really nice\nespecially considering\nthey're clean beauty.\nA lot of clean beauty products\nthat I've tried have gone bad\nin 30 days or less, which is\nwhy I'm not particularly fond\nof brands that tout that\nthey're clean beauty.\nSo who are these products for?\nIn my opinion, these products are\nfor people who love no makeup, people\nwho love to do monochromatic\nmakeup looks, who like that\nlike slightly messy lived in makeup look.\nIf these are things that appeal to you,\nI definitely feel like\nyou will wanna check out\nthe Axiology products.\nIf you were somebody who\nwants really bold hues\nand you want your makeup\nto be very visible\nand in your face, I don't\nthink that these are for you\nbecause I'm not sure\nthat you'll be able to\nget the results that you're looking for.\nSo tell me, what do you\nthink of the brand Axiology?\nPlease let me know in the comments below.\nThank you so much for\nwatching beautiful creatures.\nI love you and I'll see you next time.\nBye.",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

my dog apparently wants to be here too\u00a0\u00a0\nI love you kaisa but I don't I don't think this\u00a0\nis for you do you love the fluffy sweater do you\u00a0\u00a0\nlove the fluffy sweater we are going to dive\u00a0\ninto some drugstore makeup I've been having\u00a0\u00a0\nthis here I have a full box I have a full box\u00a0\nhere and we're just gonna dive into all the\u00a0\u00a0\nnew drugstore releases that I have seen as of\u00a0\nlate that seem a little bit interesting and we\u00a0\u00a0\nare gonna see is this worth your money or are\u00a0\nyou better off trying something else and we are\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to put you in your bed instead okay also if\u00a0\nyou like the video don't forget to like the video\u00a0\u00a0\nand to subscribe to see more videos because\u00a0\nI do upload quite a lot of videos every week\n[Music] she was not easy to convince I had to\u00a0\nmove the bed in here but at least now she's not\u00a0\u00a0\nin my lap so that we can do something I actually\u00a0\nhave two shades of the new powder foundation it's\u00a0\u00a0\ncalled eye magic powder foundation from Juvia's\u00a0\nI have one that is a little bit of a medium shade\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is a I think this is a medium one and this is\u00a0\nNicaragua this is the one we're going to be using\u00a0\u00a0\nbut first I don't know why I bought this one but\u00a0\nI thought maybe we can try this a little bit under\u00a0\u00a0\nthe eyes and this is Cairo which is a light one so\u00a0\nyou can see the difference here this is what they\u00a0\u00a0\nlook like so first I'm going to start with the\u00a0\nconcealer though because I don't personally like\u00a0\u00a0\nputting concealer on top of powder foundation and\u00a0\non now that I have a little bit more of a combo\u00a0\u00a0\nskin living here in Austin Texas I want to find a\u00a0\npowder foundation that I can be using when I want\u00a0\u00a0\nto have a quick out the door makeup look in the\u00a0\nsummer time this concealer is one we're going to\u00a0\u00a0\nbe trying out and this is for Flower Beauty and\u00a0\nthis is the get real serum concealer I have not\u00a0\u00a0\neven breaking the seal breaking the seal doesn't\u00a0\nreally smell like anything so we're just gonna be\u00a0\u00a0\nusing a little bit of this under our eyes and\u00a0\nI'm gonna blend that up with a sponge and then\u00a0\u00a0\nwe'll go in with the powder um Foundation I've\u00a0\nactually had these things for a little bit I\u00a0\u00a0\ndid an order from Ulta and then I went on vacation\u00a0\nand then when I came back we had that power outage\u00a0\u00a0\nso this is the first time that I'm actually\u00a0\nhaving time to sit down and play with these things\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's actually a really nice consistency of that\u00a0\nconcealer I would say that that is a full coverage\u00a0\u00a0\nconcealer I didn't use that much as you can see\u00a0\nand I still feel like it's covering quite a lot\u00a0\u00a0\nwhy am I red on the nose is that like a breakout\u00a0\nthat's about to happen or did I scratch myself\u00a0\u00a0\nnobody knows but I think that that concealer looks\u00a0\nreally really good like and it doesn't feel greasy\u00a0\u00a0\neither hmm I could be about that for reference\u00a0\nbefore I get into this like I said I have combo\u00a0\u00a0\nskin I live in a very humid climate right now\u00a0\nand these are things that you should take into\u00a0\u00a0\nconsideration when seeing how somebody like\u00a0\nreviews a specially foundations skincare stuff\u00a0\u00a0\nlike that I'm also 39 so I do have quite a lot of\u00a0\nFine Lines so we're gonna go in with this one that\u00a0\u00a0\nis a little bit of a medium shade I'm using the\u00a0\nnabla foundation brush that I think is not dense\u00a0\u00a0\nbut also not flimsy it's like an in-between it's\u00a0\nnot a kabuki brush but it's also not like a flimsy\u00a0\u00a0\nbrush because I want to see if I can get a I don't\u00a0\nwant to have a full coverage but maybe like a I\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't know medium is that a little bit too dark\u00a0\nfor me that might actually be just I still have to\u00a0\u00a0\nface hers that might be a little bit too dark for\u00a0\nme which is good because then I can use it when\u00a0\u00a0\nI wanted to use it which is in the summer when\u00a0\nI have a tan listen I'm a pool person who when\u00a0\u00a0\nI also put a hydrating primer under I don't have\u00a0\none from the drugstore so I use the new one from\u00a0\u00a0\nLawless but I wanted to make sure that I wouldn't\u00a0\nhave like crusty skin this is definitely a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit too dark for me so maybe I will just for this\u00a0\nthis video I will mix in a bit of this one that\u00a0\u00a0\nis a little bit lighter just so we can get it to\u00a0\nlike it look good on me today okay so I've done\u00a0\u00a0\nhalf the face and I've basically just mixed the\u00a0\ntwo shades so this is the side with the foundation\u00a0\u00a0\nand this is the side without the foundation you\u00a0\ncan see I have a little bit of maybe pigment spots\u00a0\u00a0\nor stuff like that going on here these aren't like\u00a0\nbreakouts they're just discolorations in my skin\u00a0\u00a0\nand I feel like this one is a nice medium coverage\u00a0\nit covered all of that up it makes my skin tone\u00a0\u00a0\nlook more even but you can still see freckles\u00a0\nthrough here so it's not a full coverage but I\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it I really do like it and mixing the two\u00a0\nshades together definitely gave me my shade and\u00a0\u00a0\nI probably will be able to get away with this one\u00a0\non its own when we are coming into pool season so\u00a0\u00a0\nI am going to use maybe a little bit of this on\u00a0\na sponge um for the concealer area the Line This\u00a0\u00a0\nis the lighter one the one that looks like this\u00a0\nmaybe I'll just use a little bit and just set the\u00a0\u00a0\nconcealer with that and if you use a sponge with\u00a0\na powder foundation you're gonna get more coverage\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I don't listen I'm 39 a full coverage cakey\u00a0\npowder foundation that's not my journey it no\u00a0\u00a0\nokay I've been trying you can see it's covering up\u00a0\nmost of those spots but still leaving a little a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle thing Imaging I think it looks really good\u00a0\nhere's the thing I'm just dipping in between both\u00a0\u00a0\nof these here's the thing my skin feels a little\u00a0\ndry I mean I'm not gonna lie my skin feels a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle powdery but for me and this is just this\u00a0\nis my opinion about powder foundations they look\u00a0\u00a0\nbetter over time and not necessarily when you're\u00a0\ndoing your makeup if you have nothing if you have\u00a0\u00a0\ndry skin you might need to do a lot of skin prep\u00a0\nbut if you do not have dry skin it looks a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbetter over time when your skin is starting to\u00a0\nsink into your skin and some of your oils are\u00a0\u00a0\nstarting to come through that's when you really\u00a0\ncan see how powder foundation is right now it is\u00a0\u00a0\n10 o'clock in the morning I'll try and see if I\u00a0\ncan do at least one uh check-in just to show you\u00a0\u00a0\nhow I feel about this throughout the day because\u00a0\nlike I don't think the powder foundations will\u00a0\u00a0\nreally give you what they need to be giving you\u00a0\nat the beginning of the day I'm just going to use\u00a0\u00a0\na little fix plus I actually have I actually have\u00a0\na setting spray here this is the oh the Cucumber\u00a0\u00a0\nextract this is some hard candy this is a long\u00a0\nwear setting spray Sheer Envy oh wait I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nhave the I still have the heat the tape on it I've\u00a0\nnever used it as you can see I put this off now so\noh it's a little aggressive it's a little\u00a0\naggressive oh yeah that's not the finest\u00a0\u00a0\nMister I've seen in the world you can see the the\u00a0\ndroplets on my skin I love the scent of it though\u00a0\u00a0\nbut that mister is a absolute no-go that's not\u00a0\na mister that's that's a yeah that's it like one\u00a0\u00a0\nof those you Spritz your flowers with that's what\u00a0\nthat one was don't love lump Club the spritzer but\u00a0\u00a0\nI needed a little hydration is it it's actually\u00a0\nnot a bad color and it does look like my skin it\u00a0\u00a0\ndidn't 100 cover this part but that's okay I'm\u00a0\njust gonna use a little bit of this bronzer just\u00a0\u00a0\nto Contour a little bit because this isn't really\u00a0\nsuper super dark and I just want to have a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit of a definition in my Outer Perimeter this\u00a0\nisn't the new bronzer I really really do like it\u00a0\u00a0\nI'll link everything down below where I found it\u00a0\nsome of this I've been sent as PR it's basically\u00a0\u00a0\nthe hard candy actually yeah hard candy and I\u00a0\ndo have some a few things from colourpop as well\u00a0\u00a0\nthose are the only thing that have been sent this\u00a0\nPR all the other things I bought myself I will\u00a0\u00a0\nlink it down below I know that technically a lot\u00a0\nof people do not count colourpop as a drugstore\u00a0\u00a0\nespecially since you can't find them in drugstore\u00a0\nyou can't find them at the drugstore section of\u00a0\u00a0\nUlta but I don't think you can find these at\u00a0\nUlta but I have been sent these as people and\u00a0\u00a0\nI really wanted to try them so I'll include\u00a0\nthem in this video more as like an affordable\u00a0\u00a0\nthing even though I know they're not technically\u00a0\ndrugstore and this is the woo me pressed powder\u00a0\u00a0\nblush it's the reddish coral one and then it's the\u00a0\nPressed highlighter and I'm dying to try this one\u00a0\u00a0\nand this one is oh my God look at this Peach this\u00a0\nis in Heart of Gold so I'm just gonna be putting\u00a0\u00a0\nthese on and we'll see how these are if you see\u00a0\nhow these are on the cheeks because I really like\u00a0\u00a0\nactually the matte blush is from colourpop because\u00a0\nI feel like they are the perfect amount of sheer I\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't want a blush that is too pigmented because\u00a0\nit can go south real fast you know I've been\u00a0\u00a0\ntalking about that red blush from the what is it\u00a0\ncalled now I forgot from The High School Musical\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't remember what it's called but you know\u00a0\nwhich one I'm talking about it's so beautiful\u00a0\u00a0\nit's a warm red blush oh this is more like a\u00a0\npinky corally red I've been really into that now\u00a0\u00a0\nturned into too much I've been really into reddish\u00a0\nblushes as a blade and maybe for like Valentine's\u00a0\u00a0\nthis could be nice I keep calling Valentine's\u00a0\nHalloween and my husband is like what is wrong\u00a0\u00a0\nwith you he's like are you afraid of Valentine's\u00a0\nI keep calling it Halloween and I don't know why\u00a0\u00a0\nsomebody stopped me I don't understand so let me\u00a0\nsee if I can find a good hype so let's do this one\u00a0\u00a0\nit feels like a typical powder highlighter and\u00a0\nI don't know how good it's gonna stick because\u00a0\u00a0\nwe got a pretty powdery skin that is more\u00a0\nsubtle and I'm sure that if I spray this I\u00a0\u00a0\nwould be able to get that to be a little bit\u00a0\nmore intense but also I will say after those\u00a0\u00a0\nrare Beauty highlighters it's kind of nice with a\u00a0\nhighlighter that's not bam in your face it's nice\u00a0\u00a0\nwith something that's just giving you a little\u00a0\nbit of a glow without signaling to the aliens\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't love that my nose is still red maybe\u00a0\nit looks a little bit like I put blush on there\u00a0\u00a0\nlisten this is what we're going with first\u00a0\nwhen I bought these things because I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0\nbe wearing the LA girl for play eyeshadow in\u00a0\nthis green I thought I was going to be wearing\u00a0\u00a0\nthis wet and wild megalus lock and shine\u00a0\nthis color but I've already tried this one\u00a0\u00a0\nand it absolutely sucks buyer beware this is\u00a0\nan awful product I've already tried it it is\u00a0\u00a0\nif you want to try a product like this don't\u00a0\nbuy this one it's absolutely atrocious this is\u00a0\u00a0\ngonna have like just Fast Pace going into the\u00a0\nworst of 2023. so instead we are going to do\u00a0\u00a0\nthis Revlon ColorStay suede inch and this one\u00a0\nis more of a red you're snoring so loudly this\u00a0\u00a0\nis more of a red oh and I did my brows I mean\u00a0\nyou can see you got eyes and so we're gonna do\u00a0\u00a0\nthis color combo and I think I'm gonna try and\u00a0\nplay my eyes down a little bit and do this one I\u00a0\u00a0\nalso bought these lashes because they look so good\u00a0\nonline but in real life I don't like them at all\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't like how these look it is the my lash but\u00a0\nBolder they don't look like anyone's lash I yeah\u00a0\u00a0\nonline they look so cute but now that I got them\u00a0\nI'm like I don't like how these look at all so\u00a0\u00a0\nI might put on some like clusters or something\u00a0\nI don't know it depends on how the eye look is\nthat's a cute color I thought it\u00a0\nwas gonna be based on the that's\u00a0\u00a0\nsmells amazing oh I'm not gonna have candy this\u00a0\nsmells like candy fruity wonderful kids candy\u00a0\u00a0\nand I have never been more in the market for candy\u00a0\nin my life oh wow this smells so great I've always\u00a0\u00a0\nsaid that the I look crazy I always said that the\u00a0\nOdin's eye lip products smelled the best in the\u00a0\u00a0\nworld these are really rivaling that such a lovely\u00a0\nscent Tutti Frutti candy almost like those you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow those necklaces that you had on that was\u00a0\nhard candy and you could bite it off and then\u00a0\u00a0\neventually it just ended up being like elastic\u00a0\nband it smells like that really lovely okay\u00a0\u00a0\nonline this looked like it was going to be a like\u00a0\na burnt orange red but it's definitely not that\u00a0\u00a0\ndefinitely not bad so I'm kind of disappointed\u00a0\nwith the color but we're going with the red lip\u00a0\u00a0\ntoday okay this is going on a little bit like a\u00a0\nfilm and it's feeling a little sticky right now\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know how I feel about that I'm gonna\u00a0\nlet this dry down a little bit and I'll give\u00a0\u00a0\nyou some thoughts because right now it does feel\u00a0\na little thick and filmy okay so it does dry\u00a0\u00a0\ndown but it feels a little heavy on the lips I'll\u00a0\nlet you know about the wear of this as well like\u00a0\u00a0\nI can feel it on my lips I don't know how I feel\u00a0\nit's not feeling drying just feeling a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nheavy I'm going to be using this eyeshadow\u00a0\npalette this one is in the color cowgirl\u00a0\u00a0\nit is like a let me actually just Swatch this\u00a0\nit's like a um subtle green yellow color story\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know what I don't hate that I don't hate that\u00a0\nat all huh that's that's not bad let me do some\u00a0\u00a0\neye primer and we'll start with this one here the\u00a0\nlike pukey brownie swampy green I feel like I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I'm super loving my base right now which\u00a0\nis a shame because I really want to love like\u00a0\u00a0\nall the foundations of course that you get but\u00a0\nthere is something about it I don't know I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nknow again it might look better in a bit it's just\u00a0\nlooking very matte then with the I don't even know\u00a0\u00a0\nif I want to call it a medium maybe it's a light\u00a0\nto medium coverage it's maybe it's the cheek color\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe a red cheek isn't the best with this kind of\u00a0\nI don't know something about it is throwing me off\u00a0\u00a0\njust a little bit just a little bit\u00a0\nI'm just putting this in my crease\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm blending out the edge and I think we're\u00a0\njust gonna layer the shimmers above it\u00a0\u00a0\nthat is really nice is it super opaque no uh this\u00a0\nis not the most opaque color I've ever used in\u00a0\u00a0\nmy life but it's definitely doable it's a nice\u00a0\ncolor not top shelf but definitely a good color\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm just putting this all over and honestly\u00a0\nI feel like this matte color is one of those\u00a0\u00a0\ncolors that if you have a little bit of a yellow\u00a0\nundertone like me this is the perfect one and done\u00a0\u00a0\nShadow like this could be this could be it you\u00a0\ncould be done and you could be out the window\ndon't no don't leave the wind no no no out\u00a0\nthe front door calm down close the window\u00a0\u00a0\nback away back back away we're going through\u00a0\nthe front door and it doesn't have to be\u00a0\u00a0\nlike more complicated than this I think it's\u00a0\npretty let us do some of the shimmers I kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof want to do like just I wanted to keep this a\u00a0\nlittle easy so I think I'm gonna use my fingers\nhmm is this giving it's a little more of it I\u00a0\ndon't want to call it dry but it's definitely\u00a0\u00a0\nnot one of those more oily formulas so it doesn't\u00a0\nlike 100 give you that foiled sticking to itself\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of a result it's not one of those that\u00a0\nfoil but it's definitely giving some sparkle\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm putting that in the outer part and then\u00a0\non the clean finger I'm doing this lighter one\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna put that on the inner part like\u00a0\nI said I just want to keep it a little bit\u00a0\u00a0\nsimple not every makeup look has to be the most\u00a0\nintense ever these are a little dry I I liked\u00a0\u00a0\nI like the math better than I like these Shimmers\u00a0\u00a0\nI mean they show up but they're not like\u00a0\nsuper intense why am I so red on the nose\nI mean I could I could spray them and put them\u00a0\non but usually putting them on with your fingers\u00a0\u00a0\ngive the same result so yeah these shimmered\u00a0\nlook a little better in the pan than they do\u00a0\u00a0\nactually on the eyes I'm gonna use a little\u00a0\npencil brush I just cleaned it off of my Sigma\u00a0\u00a0\ncolor switch and I'm doing this light color yeah\u00a0\nthese mats they're kind of they're kind of nice I\u00a0\u00a0\nwould like these quads to come out with just mats\u00a0\nhonestly that's nice I like that okay Ellie girl\u00a0\u00a0\nmaybe with a little glitter glue or something\u00a0\nyou can get these shimmers to really pop but\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I said I want to keep it a little\u00a0\nbit effortless today I don't hate that I\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't hate that I hate that like my eye sinks\u00a0\nin here so I always feel like I look so patchy\u00a0\u00a0\nhere because of this little divot I think you\u00a0\ncan see it here do you see how it yeah I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't love that what am I gonna\u00a0\ndo have a filler in my outer corner\u00a0\u00a0\ncan you do can you do that I don't know don't\u00a0\nhate that I also have this liquid eyeliner\u00a0\u00a0\nby hard candy I'm not gonna do Wing but I was\u00a0\nthinking maybe I can do one of those how do you\u00a0\u00a0\nget this open I can do one of those that I like\u00a0\nto do a little detail here above my hood you can\u00a0\u00a0\nsee this Hood I like to do a little detail to like\u00a0\navert your eyes from that listen I have to break\u00a0\u00a0\ninto this one watch me ah shove this tweezer\u00a0\ninto my hand having to go to get it fixed oh\u00a0\u00a0\nmy this is this is a lot this is like an escape\u00a0\nroom hello okay I ripped it apart I'm that person\u00a0\u00a0\noh stroke of gorgeous color liquid eyeliner let's\u00a0\nshake it a bit and let's see how this looks hmm\nit looks a little sheer but I'm sure we can build\u00a0\nit up you know what it matches my shirt let's do\u00a0\u00a0\nmascara first and we'll end with this one because\u00a0\nI think I only have those two products left and\u00a0\u00a0\nmascara is of course the mascara we are gonna\u00a0\ndo the telescopic lift by L'Oreal I bought this\u00a0\u00a0\nmyself at Target and I will say when I saw this\u00a0\nbrush it seems like a brush that I would like\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I like short bristled plastic wands let\u00a0\nme show you one of my favorite mascaras which\u00a0\u00a0\nis the one that I like to use the most and they\u00a0\nare very similar in wands this is the we make up\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one the we make up more mascara it is an\u00a0\nItalian Indie brand and I've been loving that\u00a0\u00a0\nmascara for so long and you can see that the\u00a0\nbristles are kind of similar but of course this\u00a0\u00a0\ntelescopic one has this flat side that you're\u00a0\nsupposed to use first to like lift your lashes\u00a0\u00a0\nso we are gonna try you're supposed to start with\u00a0\nthis flat side and just push your lashes up I will\u00a0\u00a0\nsay ah you can see my eye is you can see my eyes\u00a0\nwondering it's very easy to poke yourself with\u00a0\u00a0\none of these because you're supposed to lift\u00a0\nit up with a flat side so don't do what I did\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I'm starting with the flat side and I'm\u00a0\npushing it up and I don't know if you can see\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I do think it's doing a really\u00a0\ngood job maybe I'll actually not\u00a0\u00a0\nuse any falsies today just so I can see\u00a0\nhow this one holds up throughout the day\u00a0\u00a0\nokay flat side let me do this first and I'll\u00a0\ncome back for the second layer okay so this is\u00a0\u00a0\none layer and I'm actually gonna just bend these\u00a0\na little bit this is a Makeup Geek curler I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nthink that this one is still available but it's\u00a0\nstill the one that I like to use okay let's go\u00a0\u00a0\nin with the second layer and now we're doing\u00a0\nit with the spiky side I think to comb it out\nwhat I'm looking for in a mascara is\u00a0\nlength and curl and I don't know if I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink that this one does that my lashes\u00a0\nare not exactly how I want them to be\u00a0\u00a0\num I can tell you right now that I much\u00a0\nprefer like these are looking clumpy I\u00a0\u00a0\nmean yeah they're intense but they look clumpy\u00a0\nI much prefer look at look at this I don't uh\nit just looks super clumpy I much prefer\u00a0\nthe Maybelline Sky High mascara over this\u00a0\u00a0\none I think that this one is looking clumpy\u00a0\num I don't love it it's definitely there\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I don't foresee this being my favorite\u00a0\nmascara I did put a little bit of the number\u00a0\u00a0\nsix I'm fairly sure this is avocado by woodenside\u00a0\nthat's not a drugstore thing but it just it's the\u00a0\u00a0\nright color for this look it's just I'm sorry it's\u00a0\nthe right color so we're gonna try something with\u00a0\u00a0\nthis liner I think the mascara is too clumpy I\u00a0\nthink it is if you want a voluminizing mascara\u00a0\u00a0\nand not necessarily the length this might be for\u00a0\nyou I don't think this is a bad mascara I prefer\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething that's lengthening and curling this\u00a0\nisn't lengthening and I want that so this is just\u00a0\u00a0\nthe personal preference that this isn't exactly\u00a0\nwhat I'm looking for so we're gonna do the yellow\u00a0\u00a0\neyeliner and I like doing like something here I\u00a0\nmean it's not for everyone but I like it on me\nI like something like that maybe I'll even do\u00a0\u00a0\nthis was better on the eye than I expected maybe\u00a0\nI'll do a second one you know what I don't hate\u00a0\u00a0\nthat this was better on the eye than I expected\u00a0\nI'm Gonna Fill in a second layer just for opacity\u00a0\u00a0\nbut this wasn't bad I kind of like it go you\u00a0\nhard candy I think I have more colors as well\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm impressed with that one okay let me finish\u00a0\nthis up and we can have a chat because I don't\u00a0\u00a0\nlove all of these okay so I think what is throwing\u00a0\nme off with this look is that this is a light\u00a0\u00a0\ncoverage leaning on medium because the more I\u00a0\nlook at it the more I'm like this is more of a\u00a0\u00a0\nlight coverage with the brush and the red blush is\u00a0\nmaking it look like I didn't cover up my redness\u00a0\u00a0\nso I think it's the blush that's throwing me off\u00a0\nhad I chosen something that wasn't so cool toned\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause this is more of a cool tone blush I can\u00a0\nshow you again it's more like a cool tone pinky\u00a0\u00a0\ncorally reddish blush if I had chosen something\u00a0\nthat was warmer with this look and I might even go\u00a0\u00a0\nover with something warmer on my cheeks it would\u00a0\nhave matched my skin tone better and it would have\u00a0\u00a0\nlooked less like a rash I think that this blush is\u00a0\nif you wanted red blush that's not a true red and\u00a0\u00a0\nyou have a cooler skin tone I would recommend\u00a0\nthis one if you want a red blush that's not a\u00a0\u00a0\ntrue red and you have a warmer skin tone I would\u00a0\nrecommend the one from The High School Musical\u00a0\u00a0\none depending if you want a warmer undertone or\u00a0\na cooler undertone so I think if I top this off\u00a0\u00a0\nwith something because this highlighter is also\u00a0\na cool toned highlighter if I top this off with\u00a0\u00a0\nsomething that's warmer I think I'm gonna like it\u00a0\nmore and I'll probably do that after this video\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I'm gonna wear this throughout the day\u00a0\nand I'll film what is this and I'll film some\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of a check-in the lipstick feels better with\u00a0\ntime it's like it almost rests it needed a little\u00a0\u00a0\nrest so I like the lipstick now I like the eye\u00a0\nshadow it's not like you can see the it's like I\u00a0\u00a0\nam missing a color it's like this needed another\u00a0\ndeep color for this to be more balanced but if\u00a0\u00a0\nyou don't like deep colors I like the quality\u00a0\nof the matte the shimmers need a little help\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I like the quality of the mattes I just wished\u00a0\nI had something that was darker for me mascara\u00a0\u00a0\nnot my favorite I think it looks clumpy\u00a0\nI think it looks clumpy the concealer\u00a0\u00a0\nmight be my favorite today the concealer and the\u00a0\neyeliner might be my favorites of today so far but\u00a0\u00a0\nI will do a little bit of a check-in in a little\u00a0\nbit like I said well now it's 11 because I've been\u00a0\u00a0\nslacking but I put this foundation on at 10. I've\u00a0\nbeen wearing it now for an hour and I already feel\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it's not feeling restricting anymore and it's\u00a0\nnot feeling dry so hopefully this is going to turn\u00a0\u00a0\nout to be good but yeah I'll put something warm\u00a0\non the cheeks and I'll check back with you in well\u00a0\u00a0\nfor you one second Hello friends hello welcome\u00a0\nback it is 1941 can you see that 1941 I have\u00a0\u00a0\nnot had this on for like 12 hours um first of all\u00a0\nthis lipstick whoever came up with this lipstick\u00a0\u00a0\nstraight to jail this is the second application\u00a0\nI had to reapply this lipstick I'm just gonna go\u00a0\u00a0\nwith this with the gloss now it literally crumbles\u00a0\noff your lips remember when I told you that I felt\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it was a film on the lips it is a film\u00a0\nthat just crumbles up this looks horrible I\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel you can see it's very glowy it's very glowy\u00a0\nthe foundation but it doesn't didn't break up I\u00a0\u00a0\nmean it is a powder I'm gonna use this is from\u00a0\nOrion Beauty I will link these down below they're\u00a0\u00a0\nhonestly so good they're blocking papers and\u00a0\nthey're twice the size as other flossing papers\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't think that this is gonna be my favorite\u00a0\nfoundation for summertime not only is it\u00a0\u00a0\na little heavy going on it also\u00a0\ndoesn't really keep the oils at Bay\u00a0\u00a0\nso it's like it's not really doing what it's\u00a0\nsupposed to be doing I don't think this is going\u00a0\u00a0\nto be a favorite for me I have liquid foundations\u00a0\nthat keeps the oil at Bay better than this one\u00a0\u00a0\nand I feel like that is one of the things that\u00a0\nlike powder foundations have going for them and\u00a0\u00a0\nI also feel like my skin is so red which is weird\u00a0\nmy lips look I can't take myself seriously how am\u00a0\u00a0\nI supposed to take myself seriously so here's\u00a0\nmy thing eyeliner really good eyeshadow hasn't\u00a0\u00a0\ncreased looks really nice mascara is still here at\u00a0\nleast it didn't it didn't crumble under my eyes or\u00a0\u00a0\nanything like that so it's at least it still stays\u00a0\non there if you're looking for a voluminizing\u00a0\u00a0\nmascara the highlighter is still on there as well\u00a0\nand the blush I did go over a little bit orange\u00a0\u00a0\nbut that red is still just very prominent I think\u00a0\nI might be getting like a breakout or something\u00a0\u00a0\nand that's what's red on my nose but also shows\u00a0\nthat this one did not have enough coverage\u00a0\u00a0\nI just didn't love my Base today can we just end\u00a0\nit at that I didn't love the foundation powder\u00a0\u00a0\nI really like the concealer I like the eyeshadow\u00a0\nand eyeliner especially the eyeliner eyeshadow for\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat it is I didn't love the Shimmer formula but\u00a0\nthe Mac one was okay if you're balling in a budget\u00a0\u00a0\nit's fine lipstick buyer beware do not buy this\u00a0\nlipstick if you are looking for matte lipstick at\u00a0\u00a0\nthe drugs get the Juvia's Place lipsticks those\u00a0\nare really nice those are really nice what else\u00a0\u00a0\ndid I try out mascara not my favorite but I\u00a0\ntotally can understand if you're looking for\u00a0\u00a0\nvolume it could be your favorite setting spray the\u00a0\nsprayer no so overall there were some hits there\u00a0\u00a0\nwere a bunch of Misses there were some me some\u00a0\nmay things at the end of the day though I hate my\u00a0\u00a0\nface no but I will definitely be we're actually\u00a0\nheading to Target I will definitely be using\u00a0\u00a0\njust a little powder to fix this situation but\u00a0\nthank you so much for watching please let me\u00a0\u00a0\nknow if you've tried any of these things\u00a0\nI would love to hear your thoughts I will\u00a0\u00a0\nprobably take this lip off because lip gloss\u00a0\ndid not save it and yeah I will see you again\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know either tomorrow or the day after\u00a0\ntomorrow for a new video I'm looking forward\u00a0\u00a0\nto it it's been a video that I am really looking\u00a0\nforward to showing you so I will see you then bye\n[Music] [Applause] [Music]\u00a0\u00a0\nthank you",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

colourpop\u00a0\nsmoke and Roses palette this was actually my very\u00a0\u00a0\nfirst time using this palette I've had it in\u00a0\nmy collection for a minute but I just haven't\u00a0\u00a0\ngrabbed it honestly but when I knew I wanted to\u00a0\ndo a pink look I was like oh my gosh this Mega\u00a0\u00a0\npalette is perfect I got a lot of good feedback\u00a0\non my last unedited video so I kind of did that\u00a0\u00a0\nstyle again today I am going to cut out some\u00a0\nparts where I'm like grabbing for products\u00a0\u00a0\nbut you're gonna see every single second of\u00a0\nblending and how long this eye look actually\u00a0\u00a0\ntook me to do I even did all of my winged liner\u00a0\non camera so you can see exactly how I did this\u00a0\u00a0\nso if you want to see how I got this look go and\u00a0\nkeep on watching all right before we get started\u00a0\u00a0\nlet's just take a quick look at this palette\u00a0\nagain this is my very first time using this\u00a0\u00a0\nit's just been sitting in my eyeshadow palette\u00a0\ncollection for a minute and I've been meaning to\u00a0\u00a0\nuse it and I feel like this is just perfect for\u00a0\na Valentine's Day look I'm definitely leading\u00a0\u00a0\ntowards like these Shades right here I'm not\u00a0\nexactly sure what I'm gonna do but let's just\u00a0\u00a0\nDive Right In And as always I prime my eyes\u00a0\nwith the rear Beauty eyeshadow primer and I\u00a0\u00a0\ndid set that with the elf Halo glow setting\u00a0\npowder this shade is really pretty this matte\u00a0\u00a0\nangel eyes so I'm gonna take this one on a\u00a0\nsigma e25 and I just want to throw that in\u00a0\u00a0\nthe crease and see what it looks like now\u00a0\nI'm all situated going in with Angel Eyes\noh this is like a perfect\u00a0\nlike Valentine's Day pink\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's exactly what I think\u00a0\nof when I see this color\nso I'm just blending that throughout the\u00a0\u00a0\nentire crease all the way from the\u00a0\nouter corner to the inner corner\nsuch a bright there we go\nokay I really like this color that's really\u00a0\npretty I'm gonna pick up a little bit more\u00a0\u00a0\non the flat side of this brush and kind\u00a0\nof pop out on the outer part of my lid\nI love that going in with a little more\u00a0\nShadow and touching up this outer part\u00a0\u00a0\nI always like the outer part of my\u00a0\neye to be a little bit deeper so I\u00a0\u00a0\nadd more Shadow out here and then\u00a0\ndiffuse it into my inner crease\nokay I'm just blending Angel Eyes into the crease\nI always get these like little Dusty's\nI don't really remember when\u00a0\nthis palette first launched I\u00a0\u00a0\nknew it was sometime was it early 2022\u00a0\nor is it 2021 I honestly don't remember\u00a0\u00a0\nI think just at the time when I received it\u00a0\nI was like um I don't really want to use that\u00a0\u00a0\nright now but I'm glad I kept it because I feel\u00a0\nlike it's perfect for this look and I do really\u00a0\u00a0\nlike color pops um mega palettes like I like\u00a0\nthe stone cold Fox the bare necessities one\nthen picking up more shadow on the flat side of\u00a0\nthe brush and just packing that right out here\nall right make sure both shapes are kind of even\u00a0\u00a0\nI think I'm going to wing this\u00a0\nside out a little bit more\nso I'm just kind of doing like light flicks right\u00a0\nout here okay now I need a lighter shade to help\u00a0\u00a0\nblend so I'm going to pick up attraction on\u00a0\nthe same brush this is like the perfect kind\u00a0\u00a0\nof light shade I like to use to blend out my\u00a0\nedges because it does match my skin tone pretty\u00a0\u00a0\nwell so I'm just blending that right underneath\u00a0\nthe brow to really smooth out these pink edges\nsee just like the subtle\u00a0\ndifference that that makes\u00a0\u00a0\njust ever so slightly Blends\u00a0\neverything out a little bit more\nI am filming a real too so\u00a0\nif you see me like looking\u00a0\u00a0\nover to the side because I'm checking my reel\nokay I need a tiny mirror because I like to get up\u00a0\nreally close to my eyeshadow see how it's looking\u00a0\u00a0\nmake sure the blend looks pretty good honestly\u00a0\ncolourpop's mattes always work really well for\u00a0\u00a0\nme so I'm pretty happy with this okay what do\u00a0\nI want to take next let's do a couple swatches\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause let me show you what I'm thinking I really\u00a0\nlike this really light pink shade I also like this\u00a0\u00a0\none right here let's see what those look like\u00a0\nthis is Faithfully and this is on the edge oh\u00a0\u00a0\nI think I like Faithfully better I think I want to\u00a0\nstart with the lighter one because I can always go\u00a0\u00a0\ndeeper if I want so I'm going to take Faithfully\u00a0\non the sigma e54 and that's going to go on the\u00a0\u00a0\ninner part of my lid and I did not wet my brush at\u00a0\nall and like this is actually applying really well\nthis is cute\nso this is going on the inner part of my\u00a0\nlid I could bring it I like to bring it\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of into my inner crease right here too\u00a0\nagain I'm using a really light hand today\nthat's really pretty and I bet if I did wet\u00a0\nmy brush it would like show up even more\nuh what's the word I'm\u00a0\nlooking for just like sparkly\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm I am doing a little bit of a\u00a0\nsecond layer of that Faithfully shade\u00a0\u00a0\nI love that and I'm just gonna go back to my e25\u00a0\nand softly blend around that Shimmer just to get\u00a0\u00a0\nit nice and diffused again I kind of want like\u00a0\nan effortless look today like no super harsh\u00a0\u00a0\nlines or anything just very pretty soft and\u00a0\npink is the goal I honestly like it just like\u00a0\u00a0\nthis like if I just did like a little wing and\u00a0\ncall it good but I think I want to add like one\u00a0\u00a0\nmore shade on my outer corner and I really like\u00a0\nthis purpley shade what is it called this guy\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I love a good purple so let's try it so I'm\u00a0\njust going to take a little bit of this shade on\u00a0\u00a0\nthe tip of my e25 so I literally just have like\u00a0\nthat much I just went boop boop into the shadow\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'm just going to lightly pack that\u00a0\non the outer part of my lid just to add\u00a0\u00a0\neven more depth because you guys know I like\u00a0\na pretty deep outer corner I like the effect\u00a0\u00a0\nthat it gives my eyes oh I love this color\u00a0\nit's definitely more like pink than purple\u00a0\u00a0\nvery pretty magenta so I'm using a really soft\u00a0\nhand and just like lightly patting this on\nthat's super pretty oh sorry I went out\u00a0\nof frame habit where's my tiny neighbor\nthat's super pretty so there is that\u00a0\nshade added without so you can really\u00a0\u00a0\ngo either way just depending on your personal\u00a0\npreference and same exact thing on this eye\u00a0\u00a0\nof course be weird if I did a different thing\nI think I will do a wing with this look\u00a0\ntoday that just sounds like a good idea\na little soft pink eyeshadow\u00a0\nwith a wing how cute is that\nand what I like to do too is I relax my eyebrows\u00a0\nand I look straight ahead and make sure I need to\u00a0\u00a0\nbring and check to see where this shade is in\u00a0\nmy crease because my eyes are slightly hooded\u00a0\u00a0\nso I actually might kind of touch it up right here\u00a0\u00a0\nand I need to bring it up a\u00a0\nlittle bit higher on this eye\noops I might have been oh that's too much\u00a0\nokay I'm just kind of wiping off the brush\u00a0\u00a0\non my hand to get that pigment off and I'm\u00a0\njust going to continue to blend around this\nokay hi what up yes I brought you a code [Music]\u00a0\nall right sorry little Jersey Mike's intermission\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm just gonna keep blending around this\u00a0\nshade just kind of on top of it trying to\u00a0\u00a0\nsoften it out because I definitely picked up a\u00a0\nlittle bit too much and now I feel like um nope\u00a0\u00a0\nnope I'm gonna go back to that lightest shade\u00a0\nI used um attraction around the edges of the\u00a0\u00a0\nthis guy color to try to soften it a little\u00a0\nbit because I did apply tiny bit too much\nokay that's better but now I feel\u00a0\nlike I need more this guy on this eye\u00a0\u00a0\nso I'm just taking the tiniest bit this\u00a0\nis a very pigmented color honestly yes\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm looking straight ahead I feel like\u00a0\nI just need a little bit right here\nsometimes it helps to actually like step away from\u00a0\nyour mirror to really see what both eyes look like\u00a0\u00a0\nbecause I kind of have a tendency to like lean\u00a0\nforward and like look really close but sometimes\u00a0\u00a0\nstepping back is helpful too okay where's my Sigma\u00a0\nswitch here we go I am going to clean off this\u00a0\u00a0\nbrush on my switch just to get all the pigment\u00a0\noff of it a little too much pigment on here\u00a0\u00a0\nand now I'm going to take that\u00a0\nreally light attraction shade again\u00a0\u00a0\nand same exact thing softening out this guy color\u00a0\nso I kind of like made a mistake on this eye and\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm almost like repeating the same mistake on this\u00a0\neye just because I want my eyes to be even right\nlike even if I don't like a\u00a0\nstep I did I'll always do it\u00a0\u00a0\non the other eye or else it just won't look right\nokay now I'm going to add a tiny bit\u00a0\nmore of that angel eyes on this eye\u00a0\u00a0\nand this is the what happens when you have two\u00a0\ndifferent shaped eyes this eye is a little more\u00a0\u00a0\nhooded and kind of falls down a bit more\u00a0\nthis eye is a little more lifted so this\u00a0\u00a0\nis just what I deal with but I really feel like\u00a0\ntaking a step back does help a lot and I feel\u00a0\u00a0\nlike it's looking much more even now I'm gonna\u00a0\ntake a tiny bit of this this one on the edge\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm going to place that just right in the\u00a0\ncenter of my lid and I'm going to use that\u00a0\u00a0\nsame e54 brush so I'm kind of blending that\u00a0\nlight Shimmer into the matte Shades and using\u00a0\u00a0\nthis as my blending shade just like a\u00a0\nlittle tap tap right here in the center\noh I like that\nso I'm going to eat my jersey mics do my face\u00a0\nmakeup and then we'll come back we'll do the\u00a0\u00a0\nlower lash line the wing mascara lashes all\u00a0\nthat good stuff all right I ate my sandwich\u00a0\u00a0\nand I did my face makeup let's do the lower\u00a0\nlash line I'm going to take a sigma e54 with\u00a0\u00a0\nmore of that angel eye shade and I'm going to\u00a0\nblend that along the entire lower lash line\nI think the Black Wing will look really nice with\u00a0\nthe pink eyeshadow too because sometimes like uh\u00a0\u00a0\nI hear people say when they wear pink eyeshadow it\u00a0\nlooks like they look sickly or ill but I feel like\u00a0\u00a0\nthis shade of pink with that like magenta doesn't\u00a0\nreally turn that way and in case it does on you\u00a0\u00a0\nthe Black Wing will definitely help to make it\u00a0\nlike it'll make the eyeshadow look more purposeful\nthis really really soft pink\u00a0\nshade it's called a loan yep\u00a0\u00a0\nyep it's called alone on the same brush and I'm\u00a0\ngoing to use this to soften the lower lash line\nI'm going to take a little more of\u00a0\nthat alone shade and kind of help that\u00a0\u00a0\nand kind of use that to help\u00a0\nWing out this Shadow right here\njust because it has that hint of pink in it\u00a0\nI think yeah that pulls it together nicely\u00a0\u00a0\nI don't know if you can see a difference but\u00a0\nI definitely can it's almost like how I was\u00a0\u00a0\nusing that attraction shape to help blend but this\u00a0\ntime the shade has a little bit of pink in it so\u00a0\u00a0\nit just looks better in my opinion I think\nokay and I do I'm just gonna grab a clean\u00a0\nbrush because that other e25 I was using is\u00a0\u00a0\ndirty I'm going to take a little more angel\u00a0\neyes on a clean e27 and I'm just going to\u00a0\u00a0\ntouch up right here on the very outer part of\u00a0\nmy lid kind of right where like my eye folds\njust a quick little touch up here\nokay so now let's do the wing okay I'm\u00a0\ngonna try my best to do this on camera\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I'm going to zoom out just in case but\u00a0\nI'm gonna take my house Labs liquid liner in\u00a0\u00a0\nPunk so what I like to do is completely\u00a0\nrelax my eye this is hard for me to do\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'm going to draw a line from the outer\u00a0\ncorner of my eye towards the tail of my brow\nso I start like that sometimes I'll lift\u00a0\nmy eye but try to keep your eye relaxed\u00a0\u00a0\nand then I'm gonna go slightly below that line\u00a0\nand draw a diagonal line towards like this part\u00a0\u00a0\nof my eye I'm zooming out because I will get out\u00a0\nof focus so sorry you can't see this super clearly\nand then I'm just filling in\u00a0\nthat little triangle I made\nforeign\nand now I'm going to draw a\u00a0\nlittle bit more towards the\u00a0\u00a0\ntail of the wing to kind of just\u00a0\nmake it look a little bit nicer\njust like that so when my eye is relaxed\u00a0\nyou can see the wing now I'm just going\u00a0\u00a0\nto do a line across my lash line kind of as normal\nall right that looks pretty good\u00a0\nnow to do the other eye and this\u00a0\u00a0\nis the tricky part I'll do the\u00a0\nsame exact thing relaxing my eye\ndrawing a line and this side is always harder\u00a0\nfor me to do you'll definitely see that\nand now I will lift up my lids\nsorry I have to be like so quiet as I'm doing this\u00a0\u00a0\nokay they're looking they're looking okay let's\u00a0\ndo the Lash line part this is the easy part\nokay I don't know if you can see now you\u00a0\ncan see how just like squiggly that line is\u00a0\u00a0\num and this one's not just because this is harder\u00a0\nfor me to do straight up so what I'm going to\u00a0\u00a0\ndo is switch eyeliners to a smaller liquid\u00a0\none and I've been really liking this tarte\u00a0\u00a0\ndouble take awake so it has a tiny pen on this\u00a0\nside and then a nude liner on that side so I'm\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to take this side obviously and I'm just\u00a0\ngoing to clean up this Jagged line that I made\nand this is easier for me to do with this\u00a0\nsmaller pen so now I'm looking at both eyes\u00a0\u00a0\nI will kind of make them look similar but\u00a0\nI just I know they're never going to look\u00a0\u00a0\nexactly the same and I just kind\u00a0\nof have to live with that fix this\nright here\nit's turning into kind of a thick\u00a0\nWing isn't it hmm I'm gonna fix\nthis a bit\ngoing further into my inner corner\nokay let me just take a step back\u00a0\nhere let me brighten that up is\u00a0\u00a0\nthis one longer I think it is so I'm\u00a0\ngonna elongate this one just a tad\nsee how this one kind of has more of like\u00a0\na swoop to it well this one's more straight\nokay I think that's fine what I do like to do\u00a0\nas well does this have a black shadow in it\u00a0\u00a0\noh it does I'm going to take this shade\u00a0\nit's called smoked out which is kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nperfect and I'm just taking that on a\u00a0\nlittle angled brush and I'm just going\u00a0\u00a0\nto go over the black liner and this just kind\u00a0\nof like adds a little bit of a softness to it\u00a0\u00a0\nso it's less harsh and I feel like you\u00a0\ncan see the mistakes a little bit less\nI love using black shadow on top of liner\u00a0\nand it just like it just looks good too\noh this Wing is so much thicker I'm\u00a0\ntrying not to let it bother me but it is\u00a0\u00a0\nbothering me taking a little more of the black\u00a0\nand I'm gonna try to thicken this part of this wig\nhalf of this video is literally\u00a0\ngonna be me doing My Wings\u00a0\u00a0\nbut maybe that's kind of fun because I never\u00a0\nreally do my full Wings on camera you know\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know what I'm fine with that I'm gonna\u00a0\nleave it like this let's do some mascara\u00a0\u00a0\nand I'm actually going to fast\u00a0\nforward to this part because\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know how to put a mascara I'm\u00a0\ngoing to use The Hourglass caution\nI feel like adding mascara kind of makes\u00a0\neverything look better too obviously because\u00a0\u00a0\nyou're like finishing the look these are\u00a0\nthick Wings oh my gosh it's okay it's okay\nI feel like if I were to make this video\u00a0\nmore like 20 23 friendly I should have\u00a0\u00a0\ndone like a smaller Wing you know that\u00a0\nlike little half Wing that everyone's\u00a0\u00a0\ndoing I feel like that would have been\u00a0\nbetter but you know it is what it is\nokay I'm gonna let that mascara dry and then\u00a0\nI will get rid of any like little clumps and\u00a0\u00a0\nmarks on my face I'm gonna get my lashes\u00a0\nready really quick I wish I had a flirt\u00a0\u00a0\nin stock because those would be perfect for\u00a0\nValentine's Day but unfortunately they're out\u00a0\u00a0\nof stock right now I might do flare little half\u00a0\nlash moment I definitely want to do a half lash\u00a0\u00a0\nI know that I think I'll do flare and I've\u00a0\nworn these ones before so they'll be pretty\u00a0\u00a0\neasy to pop on I'm actually going to Sephora\u00a0\nwith my mom after I film this video and I'm so\u00a0\u00a0\nexcited she needed some new stuff and she's like\u00a0\nwill you come with me and I was like of course\u00a0\u00a0\num I might buy some things for myself\u00a0\nthings that have been on my wish list\u00a0\u00a0\nfor a minute we will see we'll see what's\u00a0\nin stocks I feel like stores just don't\u00a0\u00a0\nhave much in stock anymore you know all\u00a0\nright the glue is tacky let's pop this on\nI'm honestly not mad at the thick wing\u00a0\nfor wearing a half lash like this because\u00a0\u00a0\nnow you really can't tell that I'm\u00a0\nwearing a half lash I feel like not\u00a0\u00a0\nthat it looks natural but like you won't\u00a0\nbe able to see any lash band or anything\u00a0\u00a0\nthat looks good I like that and I am trying to\u00a0\nmake this video a little bit shorter than my last\u00a0\u00a0\none where I'm cutting out tiny bits of me doing my\u00a0\nmakeup like taking the glue off the Lash because\u00a0\u00a0\nthat's just a waste of time you guys don't need to\u00a0\nsee that but just know that I am doing that and I\u00a0\u00a0\nwait about 30 seconds to put on the Lash after I\u00a0\nput the glue on just so it gets a little bit tacky\u00a0\u00a0\nactually as I'm holding that I'm gonna\u00a0\ntake my last object reusable Q-tips I\u00a0\u00a0\nreally like these guys and I'm gonna kind\u00a0\nof smudge away any mascara that's down here\u00a0\u00a0\nkind of like multitask you know I always get\u00a0\nmascara along my lower lash line always always\nsee how easy that just smudged away with this one\nokay pop it on this slash\nneed to use two hands for this\nokay I do have a little bit\u00a0\nof mascara top lash line too\nsmudge that away\nand I'm trying to decide if I want to deepen\u00a0\nup my lower lash line a little bit I think I\u00a0\u00a0\nmight just because my top lash line feels a bit\u00a0\nheavy just because I made that liner so thick\u00a0\u00a0\nso I need I'm going to take a sigma E21 with the\u00a0\nthis guy shade I was going to stamp this kind of\u00a0\u00a0\nalong the base of my lower lashes to add a little\u00a0\nbit of definition a little more pink and magenta\nthat's pretty\nokay and then I am going to take a little bit\u00a0\nof that black smoked out shade and same thing\u00a0\u00a0\non the very outer part make sure you tap it off\u00a0\nthough so I don't get black Fallout on my face\nand I feel like when you're using\u00a0\npink eyeshadow on your lower lash\u00a0\u00a0\nline you want to keep it pretty close to\u00a0\nyour eye like you don't want to drag it\u00a0\u00a0\nout too far because I think that's\u00a0\nhow you get that kind of sick look\nokay\nokay make sure those are even\nnow I'm going to take my little\u00a0\nlash squeezy tool and I'm going to\u00a0\u00a0\nsqueeze my fake lashes with my natural ones\u00a0\nright at the Lash band got a little stuck\nI do have it oops I do have a tiny bit of black\u00a0\non my face so I'm going to take a fluffy brush\u00a0\u00a0\njust wipe that away and it should go away\u00a0\npretty quickly since I did powder my face\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm gonna take this one more time with that\u00a0\nblack shadow and just go over that lash line\u00a0\u00a0\nsince I have the Lash band on it right\u00a0\nnow and I'm just stamping on that black\nand now we need to highlight got a couple options\u00a0\nin here I'm Gonna Do Love Hurts on my Sigma E30\nI was also looking at the shade Thorn\u00a0\napart but it looked a little too yellow\u00a0\u00a0\nand I wanted this kind of wider shade\nthis is honestly like the\u00a0\nperfect Valentine's Day palette\u00a0\u00a0\ngorgeous and I'm going to add\u00a0\na little bit under my brow\nall right I'm gonna go finish my lips\u00a0\noff camera and then I'll show you the\u00a0\u00a0\nfull face I am honestly struggling\u00a0\nto come up with a good lip combo to\u00a0\u00a0\ngo with this eye because this is kind\u00a0\nof like a bubble gum pink color and I\u00a0\u00a0\ndon't have any lip colors like that so\u00a0\nI tried a couple pink things I have and\nI'm just not liking it hmm I just got to go with\u00a0\nmy tried and true Fenty fussy it's in my project\u00a0\u00a0\npan it literally goes with everything so we're\u00a0\njust doing this so this is the full look using\u00a0\u00a0\nthe colourpop smoke and Roses palette I feel like\u00a0\nthis turned out so pretty I love the shade of pink\u00a0\u00a0\non the eyes again it's like a bubble gum pink\u00a0\nyou guys seem to really like my last unedited\u00a0\u00a0\nvideo so please let me know if you're liking\u00a0\nthis style of eyeshadow tutorial and I hope\u00a0\u00a0\nyou guys enjoy this video thank you so much

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

                "comment": "Sorry for the long comment in advance!!  I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

She has used filters too.  She has yet to apologize and she shouldn&#39;t be given the benefit of the doubt at all. That ship sailed.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

        "transcript_text": "hey guys so for today's video I was in the\nmood to do another pinky kind of Valentine's\nDay inspired eyeshadow look so today I created\nthis look using the sigma new mod palette\nI think as I'm filming this video they're\nactually launching a seven pan version of\nthis palette so whether you have this one\nor want to pick up the seven pan version it\nwould be perfect to create this look I do\nhave a couple other tutorials on my channel\nusing this palette so if you want to check\nthose out I'll link those down below for you\nso if you want to see how I got this makeup\nlook go and keep on watching but before we\nget started this video is kindly sponsored\nby Anna Louisa I am so excited to be working\nwith Anna Louisa because I've actually been\nwearing their jewelry for months now so when\nthey wanted to partner together for Valentine's\nDay I was like yes this is perfect ever since\nI cut all my hair off I've been trying to\nplay around with more earrings because now\nyou can obviously clearly see my ears and\nyou know those snake earrings that I wear\nall the time those are from Anna Louisa I\nlove this one so much and I just really love\ntheir pieces and how unique and different\nthey are but they are affordable and high\nquality their pieces start at thirty nine\ndollars which I think is really good for high\nquality jewelry and one thing I love about\nthem is how they don't make my ears like sensitive\nat all I personally have really sensitive\nears so if I wear like any cheap jewelry from\nlike Amazon or something my ear holes will\nlike literally be hurting at the end of the\nday I'm sure you can relate but like I said\nI've been wearing Anna Louisa jewelry for\nmonths now and they do not bug my ears at\nall I can wear their pieces all day with no\nirritation and the pieces that I've been wearing\nfor months now from them have not faded at\nall so let me show you the pieces that I'm\nwearing now and we'll talk about their Valentine's\nDay at BOGO sale so first I have on these\nAsh double earrings and I've been eyeballing\nthese on their website for a minute now so\nI'm so happy to have these I love how unique\nthey are kind of with like the chain link\nmoment you know how like chain link necklaces\nare in now I really like this in the earrings\nand I also like how they're kind of an edgy\nstyle so today I'm just wearing like a black\nbodysuit so I love how these complement the\nwhole outfit I also have on this simple ear\ncuff that I absolutely love so like I said\nnow that I cut my hair short and you can see\nmy ears I've really been wanting more piercings\nbut I just haven't gone through with yet just\ndealing like with the whole healing process\nand everything but I love this simple cuff\nbecause it gives that look of like a orbital\nconch piercing without actually getting the\npiercing so you actually just kind of pull\nit off like that and it's just a cute little\ncuff I think this is just super cute so you\njust kind of slide it on like that and then\npinch it together in place and there you go\na cute little cuff I love it what I also love\nabout the cuff too is that I feel like you\ncould pair it with so many different types\nof earrings whether you want like a more subtle\nkind of everyday look or something a little\nmore edgier like these kind of earrings so\nlike I said Anna Louisa is currently doing\na buy one get one half off sale for Valentine's\nDay so I think this is a great way to treat\nyourself for Valentine's Day if you want to\nget like a pair of earrings and a necklace\nor a bracelet and a ring just kind of switch\nit up a little bit or you can do something\nfor galentine's day get one for yourself and\nget the other for a friend get a little matching\npieces that would be so cute so if you want\nto check out Anna Louisa I will leave a link\ndown below and I'll also link the two pieces\nthat I'm wearing right now and in case you're\nseeing this video after the Valentine's Day\nSale my code angelabright20 will save you\n20 on their website thank you so much to Anna\nLouisa for sponsoring this part of the video\nnow let's get into the makeup tutorial all\nright let's dig into this palette here is\na little close-up of it if you haven't seen\nthe inside recently just a little like refresher\nI'm gonna take the shade new mod on a sigma\nE28 and I'm gonna pack that all over my entire\neyelid\nforeign\n[Music]\nso I did dip back in a second time and I'm\njust building up this color and I am getting\nit into my crease a little bit what I love\nabout this brush is the size of it it's kind\nof like a large packing brush but it can also\nblend a little bit so I'm packing this on\nmy lid and then once I get to my crease I\ncan kind of Wiggle the brush back and forth\nto kind of diffuse out the shadow this shade\nis gorgeous packed all over the lid I haven't\ndone this before foreign [Music]\n[Music] in the shade preppy and I'm going\nto use this to blend around the edges of new\nmod to soften out the shadow\n[Music]\nso you can see the difference there with it\nBlended out compared to a not Blended out\nand then I am going to touch up new mod on\nmy lid just one more time to make sure I have\nthe most pigment on my lid and then it like\nslowly Blends out\n[Music]\nforeign\nflashy on my finger I can't remember if I've\nused this shade before but this looks really\npretty I'm going to place this along my entire\neyelid so right on top of that new mod shade\nI feel like the shade has a little bit of\na reddish undertone to it so it is almost\nkind of like deepening up the eye look but\nI really like this shade now I'm gonna go\nback to my e25 and just softly blend around\nthe edges of the Shimmer\nforeign\n[Music] Style on my e25 and I'm just going\nto lightly pack that on the outer part of\nmy lid just to add a little bit of depth to\nthe look\n[Music]\n[Music] and I am slightly winging out this\nShadow and I'm bringing it into my outer crease\nright out here that was a little more than\nI was kind of planning for but let's work\nwith this I'm going to take a sigma e27 with\na skin tone colored eyeshadow and I'm just\ngoing to use this to soften up the edges of\nstreet style [Music]\nall right feeling good about the lid let's\nmove on to some face makeup so I wasn't really\nlike planning on doing my face makeup on camera\ntoday but I'm just kind of in the mood to\ndo it so let's do it I already do have some\nof my face makeup on I am wearing my Urban\nDecay hydromaniac I also have on the makeup\nRevolution cream bronzer in light this is\nonly my second time using it and I really\nlike it look at how beautiful this shade is\nit looks so soft and natural on my face I\njust needed to mention this really quick the\nonly thing that throws me off is the scent\nit has like the slightest like Fruity scent\nto it so whenever I'm applying it I'm like\noh yeah it has a smell to it which is kind\nof weird for a cream bronzer but I get over\nit it doesn't like Linger on my face or anything\nI do also have the Urban Decay quickie concealer\nthat I just bought this will be my second\ntime using it so let's pop this on so I have\nthe shade 20cp and I did like a little Tick\nTock first impressions of this and I did really\nlike it it's definitely like it's lightweight\nbut full coverage which I like in an under\neye concealer but I gotta say I don't like\nthe brush applicator of this I tried it it\njust I don't like blending out with this it's\ntoo short and stiff in my opinion so I'm gonna\nblend this out with my favorite concealer\nbrush this is the sigma f 64.\nand I kind of go along the edge of my eyeshadow\nhere to kind of clean up any like Fallout\nor little mistakes but I feel like this Blends\nout really easily and I also had really minimal\ncreasing the first time I wore this and I\nfeel like every concealer kind of creases\nat some point even if they claim to be like\nnon-creasing like like if you have creases\nunder your eyes you'll probably crease but\nthis one was very minimal which I was kind\nof shocked by like I wasn't expecting that\nwith this concealer but you'll notice I didn't\nput on like my Sigma under eye corrector just\nas concealer and I feel like it looks really\ngood before I set that I will touch up a little\nbit of the cream bronzer just to kind of clean\nup the edges before I add powder to my face\noh this cream bronzer is beautiful Kelly Gooch\nI see why she raved about this so much I just\ncan't get over this color too like it does\nnot pull orange at all which I feel like is\nalways a struggle with bronzers especially\nwhen you have lighter skin so again I'm using\nthe shade light I almost bought medium but\nI was like I'd rather have two pale of a bronzer\nthan too dark of a bronzer and I freaking\nlove this for my cream blush I'm gonna do\nmy rare Beauty nearly neutral as you can tell\nI am doing my best to use some of my project\npan items but I'm also using like the new\nstuff I just bought and kind of just trying\nto have a good mixture of new and old things\non my face I don't know if I mentioned this\nbrush this is actually the Sephora collection\nnumber 56 brush I love this brush for all\nof my like Cream Blush cream bronzer I just\nlove the shape of this they also have an angled\nversion of this brush that I'm kind of interested\nin picking up I definitely will add more blush\nlater but I'm just starting with this I normally\nwear like two to three blushes whenever I\nwear blush just so fun okay let's set the\nunder eyes where's my elf Elf I just reorganized\nmy drawer so I'm like losing products there\nit is I am just going to tap over everything\nwith my sponge before I set it to make sure\nI'm not setting any creases I'm going to take\nmy elf Halo glow powder I'm taking that on\na sigma F35 and I use this to set my under\neyes I'm telling you guys this powder is I\nthink better than my rcma no color powder\nand I'm shocked that I'm saying that because\nI have loved that powder for so many years\nin a drugstore powder I like more than that\nI'm like that's crazy and I really like this\npowder because it doesn't like change the\npigment of anything the shade is technically\nlight of this and I do believe they have multiple\nShades but I'm using light if you would like\nto know but but it doesn't add like any coverage\nor anything or it doesn't change the color\nof my concealer which I really like because\nI feel like some translucent powders aren't\nactually translucent okay so I really only\nuse this powder under my eyes and then for\nthe rest of my face I'm gonna use my cosis\nBreezy Cloud set powder and I'm using a sigma\nf24 and I'm going to set my whole face with\nthis and I do this so that any like powder\nproducts I put on top will blend nicely and\nlike won't stick in any places that are tacky\nwith the cream products the sun is like about\nto come in but you can see how you can still\nsee the glow of the cream products and I feel\nlike this coaster powder just like like lightly\nsets everything but it's not like too mattifying\nor anything okay now for powder face products\nI did also get my Essence pure nude baked\nblush and cool coral and so let's use this\nso for this I'm using a sigma F12\nthis is also just my second time using this\nblush the first time I did really like it\nI think I applied a lot though because my\nboyfriend was like oh you went heavy with\nthe blush today I feel like whenever you have\na new product like I just want to layer it\nup and put it all over my face and see how\nit looks you know I'm actually really excited\nabout this color too because it reminds me\nof that elf blush I was raving about that\nlike I can't find anymore I think it's always\ncheeky and this color is very similar but\nit's like a baked kind of shimmery version\nso I swatched the two side by side and I was\nlike oh my gosh this is perfect so I like\nto place my blush literally all over my face\nlike on my entire cheek I bring a little on\nmy forehead temples my nose like I put blush\neverywhere you see how my skin like has a\nglow to it and I haven't even put like highlighter\non love it I am going to add a little bit\nof powder bronzer with my hourglass one still\nhave not hit pan on this yet but I'm using\nit so frequently\nokay I know this might seem like a lot of\nsteps but this is just what I like to do I'm\ngonna go back to that F35 and I'm gonna take\nthis hourglass ambient lighting Trio and I\nkind of mixed these two shades together and\nI like to place that kind of above my blush\non my cheekbone right here and I'm using this\nas like a blending shade for my highlight\nI feel like this just makes my highlight blend\ninto my face and my blush a little bit better\nso I do this before I highlight it's definitely\nnot like a necessary step but I just feel\nlike it makes a difference for me and now\nwe go in with highlighter I'm going to take\nmy rare Beauty highlighter and Exhilarate\nand I've really been liking using this Sigma\ne61 all-purpose buffer for my highlight because\nit's nice and fluffy and when I dip into the\npan I actually dip into it so the brush kind\nof like does that like it spreads out which\nis technically not like good for the brush\nbut I like picking up my highlighter like\nthis and I feel like it just nicely distributes\nit so so I'm like almost kind of ruining the\nbrush but I like it so I want it to look like\nthat and I just do like one dip and then pop\nthis on\none dip is all you need with this highlighter\nand a little bit on my nose I'll probably\nuse this on my inner Corner as well but I'll\ndo that later and then I might add one more\nblush because I just love blush so I'm going\nto go into my hourglass blush quad I think\nI'm gonna pick up this kind of pinkier shade\nand I'm kind of going on top of the highlight\ntowards the higher part of my cheek tell me\nI'm not alone and I'm not the only person\nthat uses three blushes when they do their\nmakeup I used to never really like be a blush\ngirly but I am a blush girly now I love it\nokay now that my face makeup is done I will\nspray with some all-nighter\nall right let's Zoom back in and finish up\nthe eyes I'm gonna take a sigma E30 with more\nnew mod and that's gonna go along my entire\nlower lash line\nand then I am connecting the shadow out here\non the outer corner and then going back to\nthe e27 with more preppy and using that to\nblend out and soften the new mod shade foreign\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music] now I'm going to take a black kind\nof smudgy eyeliner I'm going to use my house\nLabs one and this is going to go along the\nouter part of my top lash line\nand I was kind of smudging that around with\na little angled brush so it's not as harsh\nlooking [Music] now I'm going to take a little\nbit of the shade grunge on that angled brush\nand just put that right on top of the black\nliner [Music]\n[Music]\nnow I'm gonna go back to that rare Beauty\nhighlighter and pop that in my inner corner\nand a little bit under my brow\nI'm gonna go pop on some mascara and lashes\nand then I'll show you the full face all right\nmy mascara and lashes are on and for my lashes\nI'm wearing my brand the bright lashes and\nthe style all natural I did also add a little\nbit of that Grunge shade to the outer part\nof my lower lash line just for a little bit\nmore of a pop I kind of just tend to do this\nwith like every look all right and then for\nmy lips I'm wearing the Natasha denona I need\na nude lip crayon in Natasha with the tarte\nmaracuja juicy lip in Rose I love how this\nwhole look turned out I love this shade of\npink on my eyes and it's definitely different\nthan the last pink tutorial I did so I just\nwanted to give you guys a few options on some\npinky Valentine's Day makeup looks it was\nsuper fun to dig into this palette again and\nlike I mentioned I think Sigma did just launch\na seven pan version of this palette so if\nyou want to check out this

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

                "comment": "Sorry for the long comment in advance!!  I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links.

I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on. It just makes me look at them differently.**",

skin has been loving these my complexion\nhas does not look this good in so long I cannot\neven go back to the time where my skin looked\nthis amazing I'm not joking and I have four\nproducts to apply and try today on my face\nand I might be pairing them up with some other\nMerit products but we're going to focus on\nthese today so here is one of my all-time\nfavorites the great skin instant glow serum\nyou guys this stuff is amazing I believe it's\ngot four different types of hyaluronic acid\nin it and it is so awesome so I'm gonna apply\nthis to the skin and it's supposed to give\nthe skin first of all it feeds the skin it\nalmost feel like it's quenching my skin it's\ngot four different types of hyaluronic acid\nin it it gives the skin this really soft healthy\nnatural looking glow and my skin needs it\nright now I'm so dull and like um because\nof the winter time right now my skin looks\nso dull so this is gonna give my skin a really\nnice healthy glow so we're going to go ahead\nand apply it and this is what the container\nlooks like I love their packaging I've said\nthis time and time again and it says to use\nwell shake well massage two to three pumps\nonto the skin before or after a moisturizer\nand I do this in the morning when I wake up\nand I also do it in the evening before bed\nbut I'm also going to apply it before my makeup\nroutine Pump It and rub it and then I'm just\ngoing to [Music] kind of just Pat it all over\nmy skin\n[Music] the great skin is a lightweight bi-face\nserum that instantly hydrates and plumps the\nskin for a super healthy glow [Music]\nso we want to get a really nice beautiful\nhealthy complexion I know I'm going to get\nit with this okay so next up I'm going to\nuse the minimalist it's the perfecting complexion\nstick this is awesome and I've tried it in\ndifferent shades and they've all worked out\nbeautifully I wanted to try the shade sand\nthis time I usually use Dune or bisque but\nthis is just a little bit deeper like a smudge\ndeeper nothing crazy but I wanted to do just\na little bit deeper because I'm going to be\nout in the sunshine hopefully soon I'm hoping\nSpring's gonna be here sooner than later but\nI thought how perfect would this be for the\nspring and summer to use this and here is\nthe packaging and like I said my skin is kind\nof red right now because of the the weather\nthat we've been having it's negative four\ndegrees outside today without the wind chill\nso you can just only imagine how my skin needs\nto be nourished during this weather okay so\nI'm just gonna apply this and then I'm going\nto buff it out Meredith believes in products\nthat leave your skin looking better after\nwearing them their products are EU and clean\nit's for compliant and their products are\nnon-codamogenic which means that they are\nformulated with ingredients that will not\nclog your pores so I'm going to start with\nthe center of my face and then kind of just\nwork it has partnered with Viva de Souza a\nlong time Hollywood favorite facialist who\nwas almost famous for her no list and together\nthey've eliminated another 73 ingredients\nthat are potentially acne triggering this\nis extremely blendable which makes everything\nso much easier all their products are extremely\nblendable Mary understands that beauty is\nnot one size fits all and they've added skin\nloving ingredients into their formulas like\nplant-based swaline vitamin B5 and antioxidants\nto ensure that their products work for everyone\nwith dry to Oily to acne prone skin and honestly\nyou guys it got rid of all the redness\nall right so we just applied the minimalist\ncomplexion stick all right next up we have\nthe bronze balm which I love their bronze\nbalm I think you guys will too this is so\nsoft again everything Blends out super soft\nthere's when you blend it out there's no harsh\nlines everything looks so soft and natural\nI can't get over how natural a healthy um\nnatural complexion you have after using their\nproduct so again this is in the color CN and\nhere's their gorgeous packaging I always talk\nabout again the packaging and there is the\ncolor so I am going to apply this um on my\ncheekbone like right under my cheekbones so\nkind of like a contour here here a little\nbit on the nose and then I'm also going to\napply a little bit on the forehead and down\nhere on my chin as well\n[Music]\n[Music] and then I also thought about using\nthis as an eyeshadow I'm going to play around\nwith the product a little bit now again you\ncan use your fingertips this should blend\nout very easily with your fingertips um I'm\njust going to go ahead and just kind of buff\neverything out with my brush I'm just gonna\nstipple it [Music]\nokay so that's what it looks like with this\nhand applied as a bronzer on my face I'm loving\nmerits products you guys you know this that\nI absolutely love them okay so here I am with\na kind of like softer look there's no blush\napplied here there is no um eyes applied but\nwhat I did want to try doing was try to use\nsome of the bronzer as a little bit of an\neye shadow so I'm just gonna go in with the\ntip of my finger it's kind of cool that you\nknow to play around with different things\n[Music] I really like that it's very subtle\nI love that you can use marriage products\nwith your fingertips it's so amazing\nand it just gives like a little bit of warmth\non the eyes which again I love I use this\nas a contour and I also use it as an eyeshadow\nhere as you can see I'm you could probably\nuse it as a blush as well so let me just put\nthis on the apples of my cheeks and we'll\nkind of use this as a blush\n[Music] which is also very beautiful looks\nlike you're kind of sun-kissed\nokay so I actually like this as a blush too\num but I am a huge fan of their blushes which\nis what we'll get to here in a minute okay\nI'm gonna go in with their mascara [Music]\num and I'm just gonna apply on my upper lashes\nand on my lower lashes as well because I like\nmy eyes to pop again this is a beautiful look\neven if I weren't wearing the mascara but\nI do love wearing the mascara so let's try\nit with some mascara\nyou know what kind of strikes me as a little\nfunny is I honestly feel I feel like I feel\nand look better now in my 40s that I just\nturned 40 this past year than I did in my\n30s I don't know if what it is but I'm telling\nyou guys this is definitely helping my like\nmy skin definitely loving these ingredients\nthe ingredients in these um Cosmetics amazing\nokay so here's what look how much bigger my\neyes look with the mascara so here's my eye\nwithout the mascara here's my eye with their\nmascara that is a big difference [Music] okay\nso my lashes are done that's what I look like\nwith my lashes done I also wanted to try this\non my lips to see how this went as well so\nwe're gonna try the bronzer on the lips too\nand it looks like the bronzer is pretty buildable\nas well [Music] so I guess if you wanted something\nthat on your lips and this is all you had\nI technically used the bronzer on my eyes\nlet me just zoom in a little bit I did use\nit on my eyes kind of as like a shadow and\nI did put a little bit on my lips as well\nI use it as a contour and also I use some\nof it as a blush as well to give it kind of\nlike a sun-kissed look which I'm not complaining\nabout at all let's go with a little bit of\nthe day glow highlighting balm this is in\nthe citrain I feel like it would go perfect\nwith all of the bronze kind of looks and again\nI'm just going to apply this on my cheekbones\nand let's just do a little bit at the tip\nof my nose I'm going to link my link down\nbelow where you guys can purchase all of these\nproducts I would say that's a little bit more\nof a complete look so this is more like of\na very natural sun-kissed look which again\nI am absolutely loving so these items would\nlook like they're pretty versatile like you\ncan kind of play around with them and the\nlast product that we have with Merit today\nis their flush balm which is so amazing you\nguys this stuff is so good so yes this is\nthe flush balm which I absolutely love I have\na few other colors they came out with um a\nfew new colors this year and they all look\nso gorgeous it's kind of hard to pick which\nones but this is the one that I went with\nand again it's called a praise or a place\nif it's I'm assuming it's like a French name\nbut first of all look at how beautiful the\npackaging is but that beautiful like Plum\nBerry color and this is so pretty so I'm going\nto use this on the just the apples of my cheeks\nand then I'm gonna actually play around with\nit and see how it does on my lips and I bet\nyou it's going to look absolutely gorgeous\nthis is probably going to be alarmingly like\ndeep on my cheeks but we're going to stipple\nit out we're gonna buff it out a little bit\nso I guess let's start\nforeign\nthis is gonna be absolutely gorgeous I can\ntell already just by going on to my cheeks\nI'm in love I am absolutely in love what a\ngorgeous color [Music]\noh my gosh so vibrant and beautiful [Music]\nnow again you can go with your fingertips\nand kind of blend it out maybe I should try\nthat Merit has added some new shades of Stockholm\nappraised Fox and permission to ensure that\nthere is a shade of flush balm for everyone\nand every occasion what a gorgeous gorgeous\ncolor oh my goodness formula can be applied\nto the cheeks lips and eyes to create a monochromatic\nlook with a long lasting glow you guys their\nproducts give me like the most beautiful complexion\nthis is beautiful this is so beautiful I would\nhave never gone for such a deep color of blush\never in my life but I know merits products\nare super buildable so you can still give\na pop of color and still have like a soft\ncomplexion okay so should we try the flesh\nbalm on the lips let's try the flush bomb\non the lips their lipsticks are amazing their\nlip oils are amazing but let's try this and\nsee how this looks on the lips I think I'm\ngonna go in with my fingertip it almost looks\nlike um like a really soft like lip stain\nand you know what I bet you it's buildable\non the lips as well I'm gonna try it [Music]\nwhat a beautiful color oh wow this feels like\nbutter on the lips here's their oh this is\nall Mary everything on my face is married\nthere's nothing other than Merit on my face\nI'm like in love this is gorgeous so what\ndo you guys think of the finished look using\nmarriage products I feel like my skin has\na soft beautiful glow but I'm still like done\nup still glammed up it was not hard to apply\nat all gorgeous gorgeous products I am just\nI'm so in love and you guys I'm going to link\nmy

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

She has used filters too.  She has yet to apologize and she shouldn&#39;t be given the benefit of the doubt at all. That ship sailed.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

video\n[Music]\nall right my pretties I know you guys\nhave been waiting for me to review these\nproducts or to even receive or get these\nproducts you guys like\nI kept saying oh I'm gonna check out I'm\ngonna check out my order I'm ordering my\norder and I never checked out I never\nordered it and I went into my local Ulta\nand there she was okay\nthere she was yes you guys I'm so\nfreaking excited\nI'm excited I'm gonna do these two\ntogether I'm not gonna do the video\nseparately but if you guys would like\nfor me to review one separately and then\nthe other one separately please please\nplease let me know\nbut yeah let's go ahead and get into it\nall right my pretty so we are here with\nthese two new products yes you guys two\nnew products I'm gonna incorporate both\nof these products in this one video but\nkeep in mind I'm gonna do everything\nelse to my face as I would regularly\naccept and incorporate this powder and\nthis actual Foundation which they both\nproduce the powder foundation and the\nliquid foundation but everything else\nthat I will be doing on my face will be\nwhat I've always done so I'm not gonna\nchange anything for that you guys that\nway we can just focus on these two items\num so yeah\nall right so we have the Juvia's place I\nam magic natural Radiance Foundation\nit is\n1.35 ounces it says a 30 bonus\nI guess they're claiming that it's a\nlittle bit more than their other\nFoundation I guess\nthat's what I said yeah so this is the\nolder one you can clearly see it's\nsmaller so yeah this one's um\none fluid ounce and then this one is\n1.35 fluid ounces so it is a little bit\nmore product in the newer one\nlet's go ahead and\nlet's\nread the description and easy Glide\nfoundation for a Flawless radiant and\nluminous complexion both lightweight and\nlong wear this weightless water\nresistant\ntotally let's go back it says\nthis\nweightless water resistant formula yes\nCellar resistant let's go back into the\nclaim just go ahead water resistant\nformula\ncomes in a variety of Shades which\nuh\nof shades with buildable medium coverage\nthat will leave the skin hydrated with a\nNatural Glow\nfree impairment free of oil and free of\nthat big word down there okay\nand it says again it says directions it\nsays to apply use a brush or a sponge to\nblend all over the face\nmedium to full coverage that is the\nclaims on this you guys I don't know if\nthat's right or if we don't know yet\nwe're going to find out so let's go\nahead and open it up and I did get the\nshade Maui which is 2 30.\nand I also have it in the old Foundation\nwas also 230 so I'm going to go ahead\nand\num see what they look like compared to\neach other\n[Music]\nall right it's really sleek and cute\nokay so this one retails for about 23\nand I believe this one's about 20 to 22\nso it's like it's it's still a good\nprice but you get way more for a dollar\nor two more on this one okay so keep\nthat in mind\n[Music]\nall right so it does on the outside it\nsays shake well like they put it big\nright there they don't want you to miss\nthat so we're gonna shake this joint up\nokay\nokay\nall right so let's go ahead and open it\nwait what what I don't get it like is it\na Twist Off is it a pop-off top oh\nit's a it's a top I thought it was a\nlike a Twist but it's a pop off top\nall right so the top comes off like so\nand it is a little pump in there like\nthat's really nice you guys love that\nall right let's go ahead and pump one\npump on the back of my hand\n[Music]\nall right so I got that pump on there\nI don't know if you guys can see it\nlet's swipe this\n[Music]\nthat's a beautiful coverage really\nreally pretty love it\nI love that coverage now let's compare\nit\nto the older one\nand again it is still the same shade but\nthis one is a lot thicker you guys a lot\nthicker\nyeah\nso the color is\noff by a hair not too much it's like\nalmost the same but remember this one is\nfull coverage this one is medium to\nbuildable okay but the colors I believe\nare spot on so if you guys have the\nolder one I say go ahead and go with the\nsame shade or maybe one shade lighter\nthat's just my opinion\nbut for the most part I think the shades\nare really close\nwhich is good\nbecause I also have\num\nI also have this one here this one is\n310 for some reason I got 310 I don't\nknow why I think I wanted to go lighter\nI think that's what it was just like my\nsummer shade so this is like my\num I mean my winter shade my more my\nwinter shade and you can see it's way\nlighter\nso that's like my winter shade and this\nis like my summer shade and these are\nboth full coverage and that's the new\nradiant foundation and the full coverage\nFoundation that one oxidizes I don't\nknow if this one does I don't I didn't\nsee that it did oxidize on my hand we're\ngonna see if it does oxidize on the face\non the skin okay\nbut again there is a very big difference\nin amount that you get\nbut again there is a very big difference\nin the amount that you do get so you get\nmore in this one and this one I believe\nis retails for 23 dollars\nthis one I think it was about let me\ncheck\nall right you guys so I did run to Ulta\nand I did go ahead and grab more\nfoundations and I thought about it\nI'm going to go ahead and do the powder\nfoundation in a separate video so if you\nguys want to see it\nuh either it'll be up before this one or\nafter but I'm gonna try the link up here\nif you do want to see the\npowder foundation for Juvia's place\nwe're gonna do that instead of video\nbecause when I went back to Ulta I had\nto try like five and I was like what the\nhell so I'm gonna do that separately so\nwe're just gonna go ahead and focus on\nthe I am magic Foundation luminous\nfoundation for now let's go ahead and\nget into it okay I'm gonna go ahead and\ngo off camera and do my brows and I'll\nbe right back\nall right you guys so I'm back I did do\nmy brows off camera and I went in with\nthe Juvia's Place concealers in the\nstraight 13 and I went in with three and\nI mixed the shades together because I\nhad a shade in between but I did give it\naway\nso yeah that's what I use on my brows\nand I went in with the Juvia's place for\nmy brows um to actually scope my brows\nto actually fill in my brows to fill in\nmy brows I went in with the eye sculpt\neye shade by Juvia's place also I went\nin with these two shades right down here\nand a little bit of that one too just to\nyou know make them look the way I want\nthem to period after okay\nso I just used a spoolie for that so\nall right so let's go ahead and try this\nout again I'm going to use all the\nproducts I normally use on my face\n[Music]\nforeign\n[Music]\nyou guys know that my favorite primer is\nto secure the blur I'm going to use that\nand I did moisturize my face with some\nPalms moisturizer\nand I did exfoliate today I always\nexfoliate before I do makeup honestly\nthen I go in with my milk Hydro grip\nprimer around the perimeter of my face\nwhere I didn't put the secure the blur\nso that I know it's going to stick\nI could press it into my nose too so I\ncan have my makeup stick there also\nthat's just what I prefer to do\nand this and\nyou guys know this is where you can go\nahead and do like a setting spray or\nsetting this or even put powder down on\nyour face if you want to be more\nmattifying you going in with something\nthat's a luminous let's go ahead and\nyeah let's get into it honey let's go\nI'm gonna put two pumps\nokay I'm gonna go one pump first because\nthat looks like quite a bit\nand I'm not color correcting or anything\nso that is one pump y'all\nthat's one pump okay\nlet's go ahead and blend it out\nso I'm gonna use this dubious Place\nbrush right here this is a foundation\nbrush this is how it looks you guys\nreally really soft these brushes are\nreally nice too you guys so\ngo on and grab them all right let's go\nahead and\nZoom you guys in first so you can see\nall right I hope that's good enough\nall right so you can see where I did\nplace it and it is oxidizing it's\nchanging colors\nI was worried about that earlier\nyou're all right Jonah\n[Music]\nand you want to\ngo ahead and Pat this into the skin\nfragrance\nsmells like flowers\nI don't know if that's my brush or\nI think this Foundation has a smell to\nit\n[Music]\nI could have went a shade lighter\nI could have won a shade lighter but it\nalso works too you know for the darker\nspaces on my places on my face\nput some on me yeah\n[Music]\n[Music]\nall right okay so\nfirst impression the coverage is nice\nI really like the coverage\num\nI don't know why it smells like flowers\nor something like that to me\nI don't know if I'm tripping\n[Music]\nit smells like flowers but the coverage\nis nice\nI like the coverage it's pretty nice\nlike you can clearly see the difference\nnot bad right not bad so let's go ahead\nand do the other side\nokay let's go ahead and go in with\nanother pump\nso at this point we're at two pumps once\nI do this other side of my face\nso it took one pump for each\nside basically\nall right let's go ahead and blend this\nside out\nyeah it's strong like it's\nI've smelt the foundation that smells so\nflowery I only think I own a foundation\nthat smells like flowers or any kind of\nscent\nbut I don't think I like\nlike that I don't know if I like it I\ndon't know I love stuff that smells good\nbut I don't know if I like\nfor my Foundation to smell good I don't\nknow we'll see maybe it's a reason\nbehind it you know you never know\ncool if I can just keep blending\nthis point we're blending everything\nall over bringing it down the neck again\nlike I said\nso that it could be matchy matchy\nyou got it\nare you sure\nso again like I was saying um it has\nlike this fragrance to it it doesn't\nsmell bad but it's like really strong if\nyou like not used to something like that\nyou're about to put on your face having\nthe smell to it which is fine not\nworried about it but look you guys it's\nso pretty\nit looks like skin like you could just\nstop right here and just leave okay\nI would do a little bit of some some but\nyou can stop right here if you want to\nand just leave the house I think it's so\nso beautiful so what I'm gonna go ahead\nand do is go off camera finish up the\nrest of my face and come out give you\nguys my final thoughts and my final look\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nforeign\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nforeign\n[Music]\n[Music]\nall right my pretty so this is the final\nlook

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on.

This feels super weird to me because\u00a0\nI'm always filming for you guys with my hair\u00a0\u00a0\nup and today of course my hair is down I do need\u00a0\na haircut no judgment but today we are actually\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to be reviewing a hair care product this is\u00a0\nthe Olaplex Clean Volumizing Dry Shampoo and I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nexcited for this like this has been such a highly\u00a0\nanticipated launch from the brand and I'm like you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow what we're gonna try this so of course my\u00a0\nhair it's yeah yeah it needs it and of course\u00a0\u00a0\nI totally need the volume right now and this\u00a0\npart's fluffy and we're just gonna do our hair\u00a0\u00a0\nbut this I'm excited for now let's talk about\u00a0\ndry shampoo my ride or die dry shampoos if you\u00a0\u00a0\nguys are interested I will share them with you\u00a0\nso this one right here is actually probably my\u00a0\u00a0\nfavorite out of the two of them they're both from\u00a0\nliving proof so this one actually has a little\u00a0\u00a0\nbit left in the bottle it's almost empty so this\u00a0\none probably is the one I favor out of the two of\u00a0\u00a0\nthem but they're both from living proof this one\u00a0\nis the regular dry shampoo and this one is the\u00a0\u00a0\nAdvanced Clean dry shampoo I do like them both and\u00a0\nI actually do like to mix both of them sometimes\u00a0\u00a0\nbut this one is probably the one I use alone\u00a0\nmore often these are like my brighter die for\u00a0\u00a0\nme it doesn't give me a white cast and I do have\u00a0\nkind of like a light brown hair but honestly like\u00a0\u00a0\nit just sometimes if I do too close to the root\u00a0\nthis is goes for everyone you will get a bit of\u00a0\u00a0\na gray white casty build up there you do have to\u00a0\ngo like six to ten inches away which is exactly\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat this one is recommending so it says shake\u00a0\nwell so we're just going to shake it shake it\u00a0\u00a0\nshake it shake it and I'm excited for this like\u00a0\nlet me know in the comments what is your favorite\u00a0\u00a0\ndry shampoo there's one that I used to love and I\u00a0\ncan't find it anymore maybe they stopped selling\u00a0\u00a0\nit in Canada but it was a purple bottle and I\u00a0\ncan't remember the name of it but I love that\u00a0\u00a0\none all right so we're shaking this I'm going\u00a0\nto part into a couple sections so I usually\u00a0\u00a0\njust go in and do my roots I don't usually\u00a0\nspray at the front I will spray at the back\nokay that is intense oh my God that stinks this\u00a0\u00a0\nthis doesn't have a pleasant smell to it\u00a0\nat all I'm not impressed with the smell\noh my God this is intense\nyeah okay we're gonna wait 30 seconds\u00a0\nyou know what that is just Wicked\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm not into the smell usually the Olaplex\u00a0\nproducts don't give me a smell like that this one\u00a0\u00a0\njust has very strong it is a very strong Aroma and\u00a0\nit is not my vibe I can't even tell you what this\u00a0\u00a0\nsmells like my camera guy right now is choking on\u00a0\nthis like that's how crazy this is it is intense\u00a0\u00a0\nand also I can just feel it going into my lungs\u00a0\nwhich is not a good sign it is definitely not\u00a0\u00a0\nan offensive smell but it is a strong like\u00a0\nfragranced smell and it is not my vibe at\u00a0\u00a0\nall not living for it now am I getting a little\u00a0\nbit of volume maybe I'm kind of so far impressed\u00a0\u00a0\nall right so I'm just gonna tip my head over and\u00a0\nshake it my hair a little bit for you guys trying\u00a0\u00a0\nto get that volume does recommend that you do\u00a0\nthat just really give it a good shake at the\u00a0\u00a0\nroots to kind of build up that volume so we're\u00a0\ngonna do that now so this is kind of how I do it\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I'll usually like you know be standing and\u00a0\nnot sitting and I'll just give it a good Shake\u00a0\u00a0\nit's funny because when I'm filming for you guys\u00a0\nmy hair is always up and then on the weekends when\u00a0\u00a0\nI'm not at work my hair's down but this feels\u00a0\nweird for me a does it look any cleaner so\u00a0\u00a0\nit's giving me a light white cast but not intense\u00a0\nand I mean I'm under some intense lighting right\u00a0\u00a0\nnow but I'm not mad at it it doesn't it's not\u00a0\ngiving me the same Vibes as say this one right\u00a0\u00a0\nhere from living proof I kind of like this one\u00a0\nmore if I was to pick between the two of them\u00a0\u00a0\nor between three of them but I would have to say\u00a0\nit looks a bit cleaner I'm not mad at it so far\u00a0\u00a0\nit's good I just feel like I really want to throw\u00a0\nup my hair and like put it up but um yeah no I'm\u00a0\u00a0\nnot mad at it it's just the smell the smell I\u00a0\ncan't get over so really I just kind of want to\u00a0\u00a0\ntake some heat to this and style my hair and I'll\u00a0\nprobably leave it down for the rest of the day but\u00a0\u00a0\nlet me know in the comments down below what you\u00a0\nthink oh my gosh that is messy let me know in the\u00a0\u00a0\ncomments down below what you guys think of the\u00a0\nproduct would you pick it up do you guys use a\u00a0\u00a0\ndry shampoo if you do let me know which one you\u00a0\nuse because

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

I fell for it too many times. <br><br>I\u2019ve heard a few Youtubers talk about products that they want to try but they wouldn\u2019t purchase and immediately turn around and ask the brand to send them it as PR. I\u2019m always shocked after that when they actually send it to them. I understand the point of PR, but if you\u2019re not willing to spend your own money on something then don\u2019t turn around and tell us it\u2019s worth spending our money on. It just makes me look at them differently.**",

your setting spray.\nYou want to make sure that\nyou are completely dry\nbefore you put these on your skin.\nSo let me tell you about the Meld Powders.\nI'm actually using Meld Light today,\nor I did use Meld Light today\nwhen I was finishing my makeup.\nThe Meld setting powder\nis, it has no oil control\nbut it is meant to meld with your makeup\nand make your makeup just looks seamless\nand flawless and put together\nand it helps to set\nand it has like subtle light diffusers\njust to give you like\nthis nice glowy look,\nwhich you know I love.\nI'm all about that glow.\nAnd this product can be\nused with a setting spray.\nIt was designed with dry\nskin like mine in mind,\nso I really appreciate that.\nSo I love that I can use it\nwith a setting spray if I want,\nbut I didn't today and I\nthink that I look flawless.\nSo the Perfecting Powders\nare a very sheer powder\nand they offer like light\nto moderate oil control.\nIt's supposed to help reduce\nthe appearance of your pores,\nminimize fine lines,\nbasically blur things\n(clears throat), excuse\nme, basically blur things\nand make everything look\nvery beautiful and soft\nand like soft focus finish.\nSo Perfecting Powders have a matte finish.\nIt gives you a my-skin-but-better look.\nThis is another one that needs to be used\ncompletely after your\nsetting spray is fully dried.\nYou don't wanna use it\nbefore setting spray\nand you don't wanna use it\nwhen the setting spray is still wet.\nBut the Illuminating Powders,\nwhich were not part of the\nValentine's Day release,\nbut since I included one in here,\nI wanna tell you a little bit about it.\nThe Illuminating Powders\ngive you a little bit\nof like a slightly shimmery glow,\nlike a lit-from-within sort of type glow.\nThey really help to perk up\nif you have like a dull complexion\nor if you feel like you just need\na little bit of extra something.\nThe color that I included in\nmy swatch is called Close-Up.\nThe color Close-Up is one I actually love\nand it's a dupe\nfor the MAC Mineralize\nSkinfinish Lightscapade,\nwhich I used to be obsessed with.\nSo let's go on the swatches.\nFirst up is the eyeshadows.\nWe have Blushing,\nwhich is a warm sandy pink shimmer.\nThere's Coy, which is a light pink matte.\nThere's Divine, which is a\nlight cool sandy purple shimmer.\nAnd then there's Eye Candy,\nwhich is a bright, cool-toned demi matte.\nThere's like subtle blue\nsparkles in Eye Candy.\nSuper pretty.\nNow for the rest of the powders,\nthere's the Light powder,\nwhich is a light Perfecting Powder.\nThere's the Meld Light, which\nis a meld setting powder.\nThere's Butter and there's Chiffon.\nAnd last but not least is Close-Up.\nSo there are all the powders\nand the eyeshadows for you.\nAgain, I'm wearing the\nMeld Light powder today.\nSo let me go ahead and\ninsert swatches for you\nof the HD cream blushes, the\ncontour, and the lip products.\nThe first HD cream blush I\nwant to talk about is Phaedra.\nThis is a color that\nSilk Naturals made for me\nand I named after my baby Phaedra.\nI love her and I miss her.\nIt's a light purple with\nblue duo chrome shimmer.\nThen we have Instinct,\nwhich is a deep reddish purple\nwith blue duo chrome shimmer.\nA gorgeous color, absolutely love.\nNext is Daybreak, which is a\nvibrant golden peach shimmer.\nI think this color would be\nbeautiful on deeper skin tones.\nAnd then we have Nougat,\nwhich is a contour shade for\npale skin with cool undertones.\nSo if you have a similar complexion to me,\nNougat might be a great\ncontouring shade for you.\nThen we have the Super Fruit\nLip Masks that are tinted\nand Secret is light pink,\nDate is a your-lips-but-better\nsort of tan type color,\nand then there's Smitten,\nwhich is a light peach.\nI hope you enjoyed those swatches.\nNow I wanna talk a little bit\nabout the Super Fruit Lip Masks.\nIf you've seen my recent skincare video,\nif not, I'll put a link up over here,\nyou'll know that the Super\nFruit Lip Mask is what I use\nto keep my lips nice and hydrated.\nI'm somebody who has like a body fidget\nwhere if I'm thinking, if\nI'm stressed, if I'm anxious,\nI am prone to biting my lip.\nAnd so I try to do my best\nto keep my lips as smooth as possible\nand not have any like rough patches\n'cause if there's something\nrough, I'm likely to bite it.\nLike, not that I want to,\nbut it's like, it's so hard for\nme to control and to not do.\nSo I have found the Super Fruit, ugh,\nI've found the Super Fruit Lip Mask\nto be very helpful for me\nbecause it keeps my\nlips healed and hydrated\nand keeps me from biting my lips.\nIn the past, I've noticed\nthat a lot of lip balms,\nI'm not saying a little,\nbut a lot, like the\nvast majority, of them,\nseem to make my lips even drier\nand then that makes me wanna bite them\nand like rip off the excess\nskin, which is gross.\nSo I love the fact\nthat Super Fruit Lip\nMasks are very hydrating.\nThey don't encourage me to lick my lips.\nThey don't encourage me to bite them.\nThey just keep me\nhydrated and looking nice\nso that I can wear lipstick\nand not have like horrible,\nweird patches going on.\nI love the fact that there\nare some tinted lip masks.\nSo like if you want just a hint\nof color, you can wear them.\nFor me personally,\nI wish that they had a\nlittle bit more color,\nbut again, I'm somebody who tends\nto favor brighter, bolder hues.\nI really love how hydrating\nand nourishing they are for my lips.\nThe Silk Naturals loose\neyeshadow formula is beautiful.\nIt's very easy to work with\nand I find it blends out beautifully.\nI used the color Coy,\nyou know, that soft dusty pink,\nin this look today\nand loved how it turned out.\nIt's a great transition\ncolor for skin like mine,\nespecially if you're gonna\ndo a red lip like I did.\nAnd I can't wait to do a tutorial\nfeaturing the Phaedra blush\nbecause I just love it so much.\nUgh, I'm so excited by it.\nYou know, I love these glowy\nlit-from-within blushes.\nThat is what I want in a blush.\nI want to look glowy and beautiful\n'cause I'm somebody who has dry skin\nand so I'm constantly\nfighting with my dry skin\ntrying to get as much glow on as possible.\nAnyway, what do you think\nof the Silk Naturals Valentine's\nDay collection release?\nWhat do you think of the Phaedra blush?\nPlease tell me your favorites\nin the comments below.\nThank you so much for\nwatching, beautiful creatures.\nI love you and I'll see you next time.\nBye.",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

dry skin so this\u00a0\u00a0\nwill be interesting I mean it's good for dullness\u00a0\nand uneven texture and this is a matte finish I\u00a0\u00a0\nam not mad at the price of this being only 25 I\u00a0\nthink the packaging it's very very cute luxurious\u00a0\u00a0\nI really am a fan of the Nesta marks parks in\u00a0\ngeneral so let's go ahead and try out the product\nall right guys so now that I got you zoomed in\u00a0\nwe're just going to go ahead and go straight\u00a0\u00a0\nin to the product like I said I love the\u00a0\npackaging I love the Nessa Marx as a brand\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is a 12th month shelf life just in case\u00a0\nyou're wondering I'm curious to know what this\u00a0\u00a0\nis going to look like on me just because I have\u00a0\ndry skin beautiful beautiful packaging Vanessa\u00a0\u00a0\nMark's packaging is very unique and really really\u00a0\npretty let's go ahead and just look at the color\u00a0\u00a0\nbeautiful shade I want to Swatch it yeah that\u00a0\nis definitely just a typical Rosy mauvy pink\u00a0\u00a0\nshade which is exactly what I'm going for so how\u00a0\nI'm going to do this is I don't have a mirror\u00a0\u00a0\nwell obviously this doesn't come with a mirror\u00a0\nI'm gonna pull out one of my mirrors to be able\u00a0\u00a0\nto use and I'm kind of just going to dip my brush\u00a0\ninto this so what I'm doing right now so I got a\u00a0\u00a0\nlittle bit on the brush and now we're just going\u00a0\nto tap this in and that is very very pigmented\u00a0\u00a0\nwe're gonna bring some up here a little bit we\u00a0\nwill have to diffuse this with a sponge because\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is a very very pigmented but I will say the\u00a0\nshade is absolutely stunning in a trick you can do\u00a0\u00a0\nhere let me grab my sponge can you have a product\u00a0\nthat is just really really creamy or really really\u00a0\u00a0\npigmented all you gotta do is take your sponge and\u00a0\njust kind of blend it into the skin and it will\u00a0\u00a0\neventually just melt into the skin which is what\u00a0\nthis is looking like and this is such a pretty\u00a0\u00a0\npretty color I'm super super impressed with this\u00a0\nthis gives more of a dewy finish to me instead of\u00a0\u00a0\na matte maybe it dries down to a mat but first\u00a0\nimpressions this is like a dewy type of blush\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat do you guys think I think I really really\u00a0\nlike it alright guys my camera literally died\u00a0\u00a0\nwhen I was about to end the video I do want to\u00a0\ngive you guys the final look up close this is how\u00a0\u00a0\neverything is looking I do truly like this blush I\u00a0\nlove this shade I definitely want to pick up more\u00a0\u00a0\nand for 25 I think this is a steal so for me it\u00a0\nis a win and I definitely recommend you guys pick\u00a0\u00a0\nup this product thank you so much for watching\u00a0\nand I will see you guys in my next video bye",

I had this one palette that was my ride or die palette, and it cost maybe $10 on sale. I used this thing non stop. I thought it was the best palette on the planet. Best formula, best everything. Then it broke and died, so I went searching for another one. During that quest, I found other brands and other palettes, and realized what I had been using was utter garbage. But I didn\u2019t know that at the time! I was an ignorant happy clam with this horrific palette! I wonder if I was better off back then\u2026it was much cheaper\u2026.but now I know what works for me and what doesn\u2019t, and why, ect. So maybe it\u2019s more of \u201cmakeup exposure \u201c than education, but I would have defended that garbage palette in comments (had I watched YouTube prior to the lock down) in videos with zero hesitation! My makeup knowledge was basically nonexistent.  I believe this to be part of the makeup view disconnect on many occasions.",

I strongly dislike how she handled Lashgate but what pisses me off about her the most is she literally outed Cody\u2019s ex for having a drug addiction which in turn sent her huge fanbase after this poor girl. I am a recovering addict with 4 years of sobriety so to me, what she did to that girl is so disgusting. She can talk about Cody all she wants in that regard if he allows it, that\u2019s his business. I am always open about my addiction as well but I still wouldn\u2019t want anyone talking about that online without my permission, especially someone so huge, and Mikayla clearly didn\u2019t have it. I was disappointed to see that she told the entire internet about those struggles, especially when it seems like this girl was already having a hard time, but sending that many people to hate on her? It\u2019s just cruel. <br><br>I could never support her anyway because I met someone who was personally bullied by her when they were in school. She cried when she told me how much it hurts her to see her bully all over social media. Its just sad to see how Mikayla acts. I would\u2019ve loved to support a fellow New England girl who is making it in the beauty community, but she isn\u2019t honest and clearly doesn\u2019t care that she intentionally deceived her own fanbase. It could\u2019ve already been over by now if she just said she put a lash on at the end and forgot to add a caption or tell everyone about it in the last clip! Like seriously! Oh well, it\u2019s not like we can even see how anything looks on her skin with all the filters.<br><br>Anyway, I\u2019m just tired of fake people. Dealt with enough in my life already so the last thing I want is to be wasting time on superficial influencers who value a dollar over the trust of their audience. Glad we have some of the good ones left, like you! Bc you don\u2019t use these crazy filters, you are outspoken and upfront about any sponsorships, we know you don\u2019t take just anything that comes your way either and you actually like the products you promote. So thank you for always being yourself and real with us. <br><br>I value and trust your opinions on makeup, even though there are things I won\u2019t get because of personal preference or our different skin types. (for example, orange is the worst color on me but it looks perfect on you) for me I try to be thoughtful about what to buy and I would never be able to consider only one person\u2019s review as the deciding factor of making that choice. You made some really good points. Glad you\u2019re not afraid to speak out.",

A good review of a product for me is when the influencer tries a product as a first impression, says they really like it, and continues to use it in future videos (as an example). That lets me know that they truly enjoy the product. Now, does that make me want to buy the product? Not always, because I watch a bunch of different people with a variety of different skin types. I have dry skin and am prone to hormonal acne.",

That doesn\u2019t happen as much today, because people have become more educated on different skin tones and undertones, but 10-15 years ago, beauty enthusiasts on YouTube would recommend a nude lipstick shade as \u201cuniversal\u201d, calling it absolutely perfect for anyone, when obviously a nude depends on each individual\u2019s unique coloring.",

Or when they are just don&#39;t something to help a brand. It&#39;s disgusting. I&#39;ve really backed off the number of videos I watch because I just don&#39;t trust hardly anyone anymore. And yes, a first impression is a first impression, not a &quot;review with swatches&quot;. Even if you do 3 looks in the video, if you&#39;re wiping them of to do another you aren&#39;t reviewing, you don&#39;t know how long it will wear, if it will cease, fade, etc. The smaller creators I used to love have gotten bigger and we&#39;re back to codes and links being pushed just like the bigger creators. I&#39;m so disgusted with this community yet again. I watch you and like 3 other religiously, and then some others here and there, but I don&#39;t believe anything they say. The other thing that aggravates me is when their community tab has links to all releases, even if they haven&#39;t tried them or like them. It&#39;s all about the money for their links. If i wanted one long a$$ commercial, I&#39;d watch TV. There&#39;s my rant for the day lol. \ud83e\udd2a",

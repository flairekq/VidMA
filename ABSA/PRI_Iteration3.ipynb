      "- Hello, my lovelies, and Happy New Year.Today, it's all about the best affordable makeup of 2021 from my rendition, my opinion, my makeup that I just kept going towards, kept reaching towards, and I just couldn't get enough of.This right here is by e.l.f.I don't usually like primers, but this one I actually (laughs) really, really enjoyed.\n",
      "Primer elf Oil Control Lotion \n",
      "This is their Oil Control Liquid Lotion with tea tree oil.This might put you off if you have dry skin, but I found that this just helped balance the oil throughout the day, especially in a humid, warm, hot climate, definitely towards the spring and summertime, but I really enjoyed this throughout the entire year, and I would mostly focus in areas where I would get extra shiny, like right here, the T-zone, or just even use it all over my face if I knew it was gonna be really hot and humid that day. and it also smells really nice. but it doesn't really mattify you.It just gives a really nice, clean base to begin your makeup.This does have a little bit of a tackiness, so I find that my makeup, it adheres better with this lotion/primer, but I really enjoyed this product, and like I said, don't let it steer you away if you have super dry skin. just make sure you prep your skin with your skincare, and then use this on top before you apply your makeup. for foundation, this was the product that just kept me excited to use it over and over again.\n",
      "L'Oreal True Match Hyaluronic Tinted Serum\n",
      "This is the L'Oreal True Match Hyaluronic Tinted Serum.This right here is not like your typical foundation, where it gives you a crazy amount of coverage, but something about this, it gives you the coverage.It gives you that beautiful, healthy look to your skin without making it look shiny, oily throughout the day, and it's just a beautiful product. but I do like to wear this on its own, and I do like the dropper.You can apply it with your fingers, but I actually really like a dampened sponge with this, and it just blends so nicely. and it somehow it looks like your skin, but giving a really good, light coverage and just color correcting everything.I love the way this product looks on my skin. if my skin's having a good day, a bad day, I find that this just looks great regardless.(laughs) I love this for an everyday type of a base, it's phenomenal.The very first time I looked at it and reviewed it, in the packaging, in the bottle, it looks iridescent.It looks like it has this pearly, glittery finish, but I don't know, somehow, magically, it looks incredible, and it just gives you the perfect amount of radiance to your skin without looking like a highlighter or an illuminator, because in the bottle, it looks very much so towards the highlighter, illuminator, like an illuminator for your skin.This product, I can't get enough of it.\n",
      "Eyebrow Winky Lux Micro Universal Brow Pencil \n",
      "Okay, let's move on to brows, Winky Lux.I don't know how many times I've repurchased this pencil, but this particular pencil, it's the micro one. and this is their universal shade.You have a little spoolie on one end, and then you have the pencil on the other end. just something about the formula, the way it applies, the way it blends, the way lasts all day long, and the color, it's really, really great.It's one of my favorite pencils from the drugstore.\n",
      "Eyebrow Gel NYX The Brow Glue \n",
      "It's not the cheapest, but I really, really, really enjoyed this pencil in 2021. so for a brow gel, I don't like many brow gels from the drugstore.I find that they're either too waxy and they just make your brows fall down, especially if you have stubborn brows, or they just don't do anything, honestly. i do like this one.This is a newer one from the drugstore.This is by NYX, this is their The Brow Glue. if you like the laminated effect for your brows, you might really enjoy this, but I find that you have to work in layers with this product. first, do a really light layer.Give it a little bit of time to get tacky and dry down, and then go in with a very light second layer on top to really comb and give your brows the shape you want them to last all day long, and this product, it stays on my brows all day long. and it gives just the perfect amount of crusty brows, (laughs) even though we don't like crusty brows, but with this type of a product, you will get a little bit.Okay, so for concealers, it's the same thing with an eyebrow gel.\n",
      "Maybelline Age Rewind Concealer\n",
      "There were a lot of concealers that I used from the drugstore, but they were more of the L'Oreal Infallible concealer, the Cover Girl concealer, the Maybelline Age Rewind Concealer, classic, but this right here, I have to say, ever since I tried it, I can't stop using it.\n",
      "Me Concealer Serum\n",
      "The NYX Bear with Me Concealer Serum, and there is a reason why it went viral.\n",
      "The NYX Bear\n",
      "The NYX Bear with Me Concealer Serum, and there is a reason why it went viral.It's a good concealer. not just good, it's a phenomenal concealer.I am in the shade Vanilla, and it's the perfect color for me, which is very rare, especially from the drugstore.I have two shades I (laughs) usually use, And I like to use my fingers first to get it where I want it to be, it's so lightweight, but it still provides you coverage.It's super lightweight under the eyes.It looks so pretty.It's so stretchy and fluid, where it just goes where you want it to go.You have no issues blending this concealer out at all, but it lasts all day long.It doesn't really crease under the eyes.It doesn't make your under-eyes look weird, crepey, dry, or oily, somehow.(laughs) It just looks really, really nice under the eyes, and I like to apply it with a brush first and then go in with a sponge if I need to.\n",
      "Setting Powder Maybelline Fit Me Loose Finishing Powder (Fair Light) \n",
      "You don't have to set this concealer, but I find that, if you have an eye mask underneath or an eye moisturizer underneath, I like to set it just a little bit using a loose finishing powder, and this right here, I have rediscovered in 2021, the Maybelline Fit Me in shade number 10, or Fair Light.It's perfect for my skin tone.I like that it has a little bit more of a neutral undertone, and I like to use a little brush to work it in there and do a very light dusting over this concealer. and I'll focus it most right under the eyes if I'm wearing mascara right here so it doesn't smudge or it doesn't move and transfer. and this setting powder, it's just a really good setting powder.It never makes my skin look crepey, dried out.\n",
      "Eyeshadow Primer Wet n Wild PhotoFocus Base  \n",
      "I feel like it looks really good all day long. for eyeshadow primer, there were two that I used, Milani and Wet N Wild, either one.Both are very, very similar, but I feel like I used the Milani a little bit more. has a thicker consistency to it, oh, that's too much, and it looks like it's going to color correct or add some kind of coverage, but it really doesn't.It just gives a really nice base to your eyelids for your eyeshadow.It does blend out really nice.It's not super, super thick, like a paste.It just warms up. for eyeshadows, there weren't too many standouts that I used throughout the year, but this is the one brand I just kept coming back to in these two shades.This is the e.l.f., their Bite-Sized eyeshadow palette.They stay on all day with a really good eyeshadow primer, and they're just phenomenal, especially for the price.I'm gonna take my finger and go in with this beautiful metallic.It's a beautiful, pewter, taupey shade.I'm gonna take this shadow right here on a small little fluffy brush and work that into the crease and just help blend it all together, soften it up a little bit.I'm gonna take a little bit more of that metallic shade on a little brush (bottle spritzes) and get it wet.\n",
      "Eyeshadow elf Bite Size Palette (Truffles, Rose Water) \n",
      "I like Truffles and Rose Water. very versatile, different looks you can create. just very easy eyeshadows to work with. very pigmented, blendable.\n",
      "Gel Eyeliner Milani Stay Put Eyeliner \n",
      "I want a little bit more intensity. for eyeliner, I feel like, if it was a gel, I either stuck with Milani or Revlon. i really like Milani, their Stay Put eyeliner, honestly, in any shade that they have available, but I'm gonna use, today, After Dark, which is number one.It's just a nice matte black eyeliner, and this one, I like that it's super creamy.\n",
      "Mascara Primer L’Oreal Voluminous Primer \n",
      "It has that kohl consistency mixed in with gel, but it stays put once it sets, and I do like to work one eye at a time just because, like I said, once it sets, it sets, and I'm just using an angled brush to give a nice wing For mascara primer, classic, L'Oreal Voluminous Primer.I rediscovered it this year again, and it's just good. gets the job done. i do like to let it get tacky a little bit before the mascara to give it some kind of grip, but it's just a classic mascara primer. for mascara, this should be no surprise, (laughs) Maybelline Lash Sensational mascara.I've tried so many new mascaras from the drugstore this past year, and I found myself just going back to this one and just comparing everything to this mascara.It doesn't smudge on me, it doesn't transfer, it doesn't flake.It can flake if it's a very, very old tube, (laughs) just like any other mascara, but just something about this, it's so easy to layer and to build volume, but it also separates your lashes and it also lengthens your lashes at the same time, and I think it is definitely because of the wand, because of the bristles, the way the bristles are shaped.\n",
      "L'Oreal Voluminous Primer\n",
      "It has that kohl consistency mixed in with gel, but it stays put once it sets, and I do like to work one eye at a time just because, like I said, once it sets, it sets, and I'm just using an angled brush to give a nice wing For mascara primer, classic, L'Oreal Voluminous Primer.\n",
      "Cream Bronzer elf Putty Bronzer (Tan Lines) \n",
      "I really enjoy this mascara. for cream bronzer, this has to be no secret, e.l.f.Putty Bronzer in Tan Lines.It's just such a good (laughs) product, it's so good.It's one of my favorites from the drugstore, from pro-grade pricing to luxury.It's just so good.The only thing I will complain about is, if you're using a bigger brush, I wish this pot was a (laughs) little bigger, but you can use a smaller brush like this, and it fits perfectly in here.I like this color.I like the way it blends.I like that it's buildable, depending on how much product you pick up.I like that you can use it with a brush.I like that you can use it with a dampened sponge, with your fingers.I mean, you can just do so many things with this little product right here, and I actually do like the size of this product because it's a great for traveling, but it's also great to keep in your makeup bag, and it doesn't take up too much space.It's so good, and I like to stamp this product on with a brush. and I do use it to actually carve my cheekbones out And my face because I find that the color, it's that perfect warmth, but neutral, where it doesn't look dirty on my skin, and I do like to layer this product instead of going really heavy handed with it, just layer it and just place in areas where I need a little bit of definition.\n",
      "CC Cream\n",
      "I feel like e.l.f., in 2021, really stepped up their game with their CC Cream, with their bronzer, their blushes, I mean, their highlighters, their primers.\n",
      "Cream Blush Elf Putty Blush (Tahiti) \n",
      "They did a really good job. for cream blush, e.l.f., their Putty Blush in shade Tahiti.It looks intimidating, but just on the skin, it looks so pretty, and again, I like to apply this with more of a dense foundation brush.I'm just gonna work it into the brush and just start tapping this.2021 was the year of cream products for my skin, for my blush, for my contour, for my bronzer, for the highlighter, but I do like to top it with a powder product on top just to add longevity. but you can see, just working a tiny little bit, it just brings back life onto my cheeks, but in just that perfectly, I don't know.This blush right here is so easy to work with and layer. for my powder, contour/bronzer, Juvia's Place.This has a special place in my heart.\n",
      "Bronzer Juvia’s Place Bronzer Palette (Light) \n",
      "This is their bronzer palette in shade Light.I like that I can use this for my skin tone when I'm pale and when I have a little bit more of a tan, but I do like to actually mix the two shades together just to get more of a custom shade for my skin.This powder is just so easy to work with.I like how soft and buttery and how blendable, how buildable the shades are, just so easy to work with, and I've used this with so many different bases, and it just works with everything.\n",
      "Blush Milani Powder Blush (Blossomtime Rose) \n",

      "CLEANSING BALM\n",
      "but does not leave a greasy residue. So I put, I have makeup on right now, so I'm going to put it all over my face and my lips. I'm not scared of it, even on my eyes. And then I will take a little bio-friendly pad, 'cause I don't use the cotton pads anymore, and warm water. I put it on the pad, hold it between my fingers like this and do the first layer of removal, and you will see how it takes it off immediately. I used to use very, very hot water. I have a tendency to have more dry skin than oily skin, so that's what I love about this cleanser is it really keeps your face moisturized. And I usually finish with just a regular wash cloth that I wet. And my mother always used to say, moisturizer and cleanser, keeping your face clean. She used to say soap and water, and so I used to use bubbly soap because I thought that that squeaky, dry skin feeling meant that my face was very clean. But because of this, if you notice, just warm water literally took off all the makeup and you can see how clean it makes your face. But it doesn't make your face feel oily, and it doesn't dry it out, that sort of really dry, that kind of dry feeling that I find some soaps do. Sometimes I have to say I... Okay, so I had my eyelashes dyed, so they look like they are still dark, but I have been known to go to sleep with not taking my eye makeup off, which is really bad. But sometimes if I wear a waterproof mascara, I don't take the time at night, but that's not good for you. Although I do look at this routine now, whereas I used to look at it as a chore that I had to do for just, for my work or for something, now I look at it as really self-care, and the ritual of it before I go to sleep at night is actually calming. So you saw the first one, which was the cleanser. The next one is the Chebula, which is an unbelievable active ingredient, and it's called Immunity Serum. And I'm going to take this, it's in a little dropper also by True Botanicals. And I'm going to put it in my hand like this, and then I am going to take this Vitamin C Booster.\n",
      "TRUE BOTANICALS VITAMIN C BOOSTER\n",
      "Now, when it's in this powder form, it stays active and fresh a lot longer than when it's already in a product. So what they did was they separated it out and then Vitamin C Booster is really just like, this will stay potent until the last little drop of powder is taken out of this jar. So, I will put a little bit in like that. I mix them together like that. I mix them together. It dissolves entirely. You can put it in with the oil, but I like to put it in with the serum because I feel like it gets a little closer to my face or my skin, or my... I don't know, somehow I just like, I like the way it feels in the serum. So I put it everywhere. But my mom always said, it's good to give yourself a little facial. Little teeny facial every night. It doesn't get tacky or sticky, but I can feel like, oh, now I can feel that I can put another product on it because my skin is already starting to absorb the serum. So I just use the second and third with the booster. The fourth product that I'm going to use is the Pure Radiance Oil by True Botanicals. And look at that color, I love the color of that, and the smell is just heavenly. This Radiance Oil smells like jasmine, it has neroli I think it is, or neroli, and then rose. I put that all over my face, my lips, my nose, even on top of my eyes. Sometimes my daytime is a little quicker than my nighttime. I spend a little bit more time at night taking off my makeup because usually it's being out and out in the elements all day and also I've had makeup on, so I spend more time at night. I see a couple of dermatologists, one mostly for like sunspots and for mole checks and cancer, things like that, and Fraxel. And then I see another one who does like more spot therapy and light therapy on my skin. And I'm willing to try anything. The last product that I'm going to be using is called Resurrection Radiance Eye Cream.\n",
      "TRUE BOTANICALS RESURRECTION RADIANCE EYE CREAM\n",
      "Now, I love an eye cream. This one is delicious. It's just, it's thick without being greasy, it is... I like to put a little bit on my hand and I like to warm it up a little bit, and the warmth somehow dissipates it much more smoothly. And I pat first like that. And then sometimes if I'm in the mood in the morning, I usually take one of my little tools and then go like that with it 'cause my eyes kind of can get puffy. They get puffy very easily. I have allergies. If I was going to a desert island, well, I would have to bring a product that had a sunscreen in it. (chuckles) But if I was going to be on a desert island, I think the thing that I would want the most is the Radiance Oil. Because it can be used on my hair, it can be used... I sometimes put it on my lips, I definitely put it on my eyebrows and I feel like I could use multipurpose with it. Although I do really love this eye cream, I might have to sneak the eye cream in to my little sack that I'm taking to the island. (laughs) There's so many trends right now it's hard to keep track of them. I haven't seen anything that's really crazy. I mean, I remember hearing that for bags people were putting Preparation H under their eyes. I have not tried it, but I guess it takes down swelling, (laughs) so maybe I should try it. (laughs) That was probably the craziest, the craziest thing that I've ever heard. Yeah, so I feel like now my face just feels so moisturized. It feels like it's gotten a little attention, but it also feels so clean but not dry, so. So, that is it. You can see how healthy and moisturized and ready to go to bed my face is.\n"

      "Product name: Primer elf Oil Control Lotion \n",
      "Associated Chunk: This is their Oil Control Liquid Lotion with tea tree oil.This might put you off if you have dry skin, but I found that this just helped balance the oil throughout the day, especially in a humid, warm, hot climate, definitely towards the spring and summertime, but I really enjoyed this throughout the entire year, and I would mostly focus in areas where I would get extra shiny, like right here, the T-zone, or just even use it all over my face if I knew it was gonna be really hot and humid that day. and it also smells really nice. but it doesn't really mattify you.It just gives a really nice, clean base to begin your makeup.This does have a little bit of a tackiness, so I find that my makeup, it adheres better with this lotion/primer, but I really enjoyed this product, and like I said, don't let it steer you away if you have super dry skin. just make sure you prep your skin with your skincare, and then use this on top before you apply your makeup. for foundation, this was the product that just kept me excited to use it over and over again.\n",
      "Product name: L'Oreal True Match Hyaluronic Tinted Serum\n",
      "Associated Chunk: This is the L'Oreal True Match Hyaluronic Tinted Serum.This right here is not like your typical foundation, where it gives you a crazy amount of coverage, but something about this, it gives you the coverage.It gives you that beautiful, healthy look to your skin without making it look shiny, oily throughout the day, and it's just a beautiful product. but I do like to wear this on its own, and I do like the dropper.You can apply it with your fingers, but I actually really like a dampened sponge with this, and it just blends so nicely. and it somehow it looks like your skin, but giving a really good, light coverage and just color correcting everything.I love the way this product looks on my skin. if my skin's having a good day, a bad day, I find that this just looks great regardless.(laughs) I love this for an everyday type of a base, it's phenomenal.The very first time I looked at it and reviewed it, in the packaging, in the bottle, it looks iridescent.It looks like it has this pearly, glittery finish, but I don't know, somehow, magically, it looks incredible, and it just gives you the perfect amount of radiance to your skin without looking like a highlighter or an illuminator, because in the bottle, it looks very much so towards the highlighter, illuminator, like an illuminator for your skin.This product, I can't get enough of it.\n",

      "Product name: Eyebrow Gel NYX The Brow Glue \n",
      "Associated Chunk: It's not the cheapest, but I really, really, really enjoyed this pencil in 2021. so for a brow gel, I don't like many brow gels from the drugstore.I find that they're either too waxy and they just make your brows fall down, especially if you have stubborn brows, or they just don't do anything, honestly. i do like this one.This is a newer one from the drugstore.This is by NYX, this is their The Brow Glue. if you like the laminated effect for your brows, you might really enjoy this, but I find that you have to work in layers with this product. first, do a really light layer.Give it a little bit of time to get tacky and dry down, and then go in with a very light second layer on top to really comb and give your brows the shape you want them to last all day long, and this product, it stays on my brows all day long. and it gives just the perfect amount of crusty brows, (laughs) even though we don't like crusty brows, but with this type of a product, you will get a little bit.Okay, so for concealers, it's the same thing with an eyebrow gel.\n",

      "Product name: Setting Powder Maybelline Fit Me Loose Finishing Powder (Fair Light) \n",
      "Associated Chunk: You don't have to set this concealer, but I find that, if you have an eye mask underneath or an eye moisturizer underneath, I like to set it just a little bit using a loose finishing powder, and this right here, I have rediscovered in 2021, the Maybelline Fit Me in shade number 10, or Fair Light.It's perfect for my skin tone.I like that it has a little bit more of a neutral undertone, and I like to use a little brush to work it in there and do a very light dusting over this concealer. and I'll focus it most right under the eyes if I'm wearing mascara right here so it doesn't smudge or it doesn't move and transfer. and this setting powder, it's just a really good setting powder.It never makes my skin look crepey, dried out.\n",

      "Associated Chunk: I feel like it looks really good all day long. for eyeshadow primer, there were two that I used, Milani and Wet N Wild, either one.Both are very, very similar, but I feel like I used the Milani a little bit more. has a thicker consistency to it, oh, that's too much, and it looks like it's going to color correct or add some kind of coverage, but it really doesn't.It just gives a really nice base to your eyelids for your eyeshadow.It does blend out really nice.It's not super, super thick, like a paste.It just warms up. for eyeshadows, there weren't too many standouts that I used throughout the year, but this is the one brand I just kept coming back to in these two shades.This is the e.l.f., their Bite-Sized eyeshadow palette.They stay on all day with a really good eyeshadow primer, and they're just phenomenal, especially for the price.I'm gonna take my finger and go in with this beautiful metallic.It's a beautiful, pewter, taupey shade.I'm gonna take this shadow right here on a small little fluffy brush and work that into the crease and just help blend it all together, soften it up a little bit.I'm gonna take a little bit more of that metallic shade on a little brush (bottle spritzes) and get it wet.\n",

      "Associated Chunk: I want a little bit more intensity. for eyeliner, I feel like, if it was a gel, I either stuck with Milani or Revlon. i really like Milani, their Stay Put eyeliner, honestly, in any shade that they have available, but I'm gonna use, today, After Dark, which is number one.It's just a nice matte black eyeliner, and this one, I like that it's super creamy.\n",
